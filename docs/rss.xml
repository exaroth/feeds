It's known as the "Dueling Dinosaurs" fossil: A triceratops and a tyrannosaur, skeletons entangled, locked in apparent combat right up until the moment of their mutual demise... That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about Tyrannosaurus rex, the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal Nature, paleontologists Lindsay Zanno and James Napoli conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage T. rex, but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species — Nanotyrannus lancensis.... 


One of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than T. rex's puny appendages... "These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture." Contrast that with T. rex, "an animal that's a mouth on legs." There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than T. rex. Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported T. rexes against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. 

"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all," she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. "That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown Tyrannosaurus rex," says Zanno... In addition, while making models of all those other alleged T. rex skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling Nanotyrannus lethaeus... 

"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing," says Zanno. "They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck."

. Seager said the engineering team is focused on replacing key system components with Rust-based alternatives to enhance safety and resilience, starting with Ubuntu 25.10. He stressed that resilience and memory safety, not just performance, are the principal drivers: "It's the enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust ports that are most attractive to me". This move is echoed in Ubuntu's adoption of sudo-rs, the Rust implementation of sudo, with fallback and opt-out mechanisms for users who want to use the old-school sudo command. 


In addition to sudo-rs, Ubuntu 26.04 will use the Rust-based uutils/coreutils for Linux's default core utilities. This setup includes ls, cp, mv, and dozens of other basic Unix command-line tools. This Rust reimplementation aims for functional parity with GNU coreutils, with improved safety and maintainability. 

On the desktop front, Ubuntu 26.04 will also bring seamless TPM-backed full disk encryption. If this approach reminds you of Windows BitLocker or MacOS FileVault, it should. That's the idea. 

In other news, Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth said "I'm a believer in the potential of Linux to deliver a desktop that could have wider and universal appeal." (Although he also thinks "the open-source community needs to understand that building desktops for people who aren't engineers is different. We need to understand that the 'simple and just works' is also really important.") 


Shuttleworth answered questions from Slashdot's readers in 2005 and 2012.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alexander the Great&apos;s Egypt: Crowning a God | Egyptian History</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td-OZjevfk0</link><author>Extra History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Td-OZjevfk0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 17:29:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg">Extra History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[📚 When you're done learning about Alexander the Great's Egypt, check out SCAV the largest annual scavenger hunt in the world here: https://nebula.tv/videos/scav-trailer?ref=extrahistory

The withdrawal by the current  represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.A zombie proposal that refuses to dieSince its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a , repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and more than 80 civil society organizations have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the  follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a dangerous misunderstanding of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.The technical impossibility of “safe” scanningThe core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.Client-side scanning, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no way to create a scanning system that only works for “good guys.”  learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. Countries around the world are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.Public pressure and the power of resistanceThe withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the critical importance of sustained public engagement in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, , and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When civil liberties groups, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as “doing something” about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don’t compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.The path forward requires education and alternativesThe repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.Breaking this cycle requires a fundamental shift in how we approach online safety. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don’t require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education. also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don’t involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it’s a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Did a Weather Balloon, Not a Mysteryious Space Object, Strike That United Airlines Flight?</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/01/0615237/did-a-weather-balloon-not-a-mysteryious-space-object-strike-that-united-airlines-flight?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Slashdot reader joshuark shares this report from SFGate:

Now, these aren’t “caused” by AI; I’m not referring to hoaxes that people have used AI specifically to spread, but things that AI has made worse by the ease with which fake information can be made to look very, very real.Fifteen years ago, this problem existed, but in my opinion, was severely muted. The concept of biased news is not new by any means and has been an issue for as long as the news has existed. There have always been audiences that are more susceptible to believing in these invented stories, scenarios, and scams, and the media has always catered to them, guiding them to the water they wish them to drink. \
My concern, and reason for this brain dump, is that with AI, these evil parties seem to be able to cast a much wider net than they could before. They can twist real news into something it’s not with fake videos made by AI; they can pump the internet full of AI-generated content that says whatever they want and cites other AI-generated sources, and they can mobilize an army of influencers that spread their filth like wildfire in an instant.\
I’ve found that recently, a huge chunk of my time when consuming any form of media is spent asking, “Is this real?” I consistently have to find multiple sources and manually scan them, looking for clues that it was AI-generated, a task that is getting harder and harder by the week. The videos are getting more realistic, the content is written better, and the sources I'm used to relying on are less and less trustworthy.A group of protestors (in this case, trolls) showed up at Chicago’s Bean with claims that there was a man trapped inside. The protestors claimed that they had found evidence that a wealth of life-support systems had been purchased during the making of the Bean statue, and also attempted to make a connection to a potential missing person (a baby, I believe) around the time of its construction. Trolls exist. They always have and always will. That’s not the issue at hand here. The issue is what happened next. This group was clearly trying to be funny, just causing a stir with some radical idea for their own amusement, but the internet used AI to take the country by storm.\
While scrolling, I started to see dozens of videos with screenshots of these purchase records, x-ray footage of a person floating inside the Bean, and “eyewitness” reports from someone who claimed they could hear knocking or scratching coming from inside the structure. There were also videos of the Bean being constructed, where you could clearly see the equipment being placed inside. Most, if not all, of these were generated by AI and are completely fake. I knew this, being a sensible human, but I had to admit that the quality created compelling evidence. With less common sense, I would have been easily duped.The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS has been a goldmine for AI generators and the conspiracy-loving masses. From what I could find, which wasn’t much because it seems a lot of this information is being controlled to stop the spread of disinformation, all we know is that a comet is passing through our solar system. This comet looks like a comet and acts like a comet, but is slightly faster and is not orbiting our sun. One scientist ventured a challenge to the “it’s just a comet” consensus to encourage more critical thinking, theorizing that it was, of course, possible for it to be an alien craft. This set the AI-loving conspiracy nuts on fire.\
My Instagram feed was on absolute fire with fake videos of this comet with lights being emitted from the sides like a ship, with exhaust clearly venting into space, and fake X-ray shots that showed the internal ship structure and beings inside. Countless videos of influencers pretended to be experts on the matter and talked about potential alien invasions. The worst part of all of this was that each one cited different sources and pulled from different video content. It was easy to assume that a “potential alien invasion” was fake; however, I have to admit, the video content they provided was stunningly believable. The “experts” talking were confident and had plenty of “research” to back them up.\
The most alarming thing about this entire situation is how fast this misinformation is able to spread and how absolutely believable it can make it. I know this isn’t a controlled situation, and we’ve always had irresponsible people running social media accounts to susceptible individuals, but the use of AI in these fields is making the problem more abundant and harder to discern.It’s not all bad… but it’s pretty bad.AI is a wonderful tool that has the potential to make our lives easier. I don’t believe that it is ready for constant use yet, despite it being shoved down our throats around every turn. It consistently hallucinates and makes false claims; it slows my work down more than it speeds it up, and has become a barrier to productivity in most situations I’ve tried to use it. \
However, I can admit it has potential, and there are small automation tasks that I do find small uses for it. That being said, there’s always going to be a heated conversation around ethics and how we should be using AI. \
I don’t believe there will be any disagreement, however, that the above cases are the wrong way to use AI. The use of AI to generate content to fuel conspiracy theories and spread them to the masses as facts is dangerous and, frankly, terrifying. I believe we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg, and I worry that we’re headed for a future where we’ll no longer be able to discern the difference between truth and fiction.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Could You Survive the American Revolutionary War&apos;s Major Battles?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utda-D7OqO0</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/utda-D7OqO0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 15:57:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Step into the shoes of a British Redcoat soldier during the American War of Independence, fighting in the major battles that defined the conflict from 1775 to 1783.

NeuralTrust found that a malformed URL could be crafted to include a prompt that is treated as plain text by the browser, passing the prompt on to the LLM. A malformation, such as an extra space after the first slash following "https:" prevents the browser from recognizing the link as a website to visit. Rather than triggering a web search, as is common when plain text is submitted to a browser's address bar, ChatGPT Atlas treats plain text as ChatGPT prompts by default. 

An unsuspecting user could potentially be tricked into copying and pasting a malformed link, believing they will be sent to a legitimate webpage. An attacker could plant the link behind a "copy link" button so that the user might not notice the suspicious text at the end of the link until after it is pasted and submitted. These prompt injections could potentially be used to instruct ChatGPT to open a new tab to a malicious website such as a phishing site, or to tell ChatGPT to take harmful actions in the user's integrated applications or logged-in sites like Google Drive, NeuralTrust said. 

Last month browser security platform LayerX also described how malicious prompts could be hidden in URLs (as a parameter) for Perplexity's browser Comet. And last week SquareX Labs demonstrated that a malicious browser extension could spoof Comet's AI sidebar feature and have since replicated the proof-of-concept (PoC) attack on Atlas. 



But another new vulnerability in ChatGPT Atlas "could allow malicious actors to inject nefarious instructions into the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered assistant's memory and run arbitrary code," reports The Hacker News, citing a report from browser security platform LayerX:



"This exploit can allow attackers to infect systems with malicious code, grant themselves access privileges, or deploy malware," LayerX Security Co-Founder and CEO, Or Eshed, said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The attack, at its core, leverages a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw that could be exploited to inject malicious instructions into ChatGPT's persistent memory. The corrupted memory can then persist across devices and sessions, permitting an attacker to conduct various actions, including seizing control of a user's account, browser, or connected systems, when a logged-in user attempts to use ChatGPT for legitimate purposes.... 

"What makes this exploit uniquely dangerous is that it targets the AI's persistent memory, not just the browser session," Michelle Levy, head of security research at LayerX Security, said. "By chaining a standard CSRF to a memory write, an attacker can invisibly plant instructions that survive across devices, sessions, and even different browsers. In our tests, once ChatGPT's memory was tainted, subsequent 'normal' prompts could trigger code fetches, privilege escalations, or data exfiltration without tripping meaningful safeguards...." 


LayerX said the problem is exacerbated by ChatGPT Atlas' lack of robust anti-phishing controls, the browser security company said, adding it leaves users up to 90% more exposed than traditional browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. In tests against over 100 in-the-wild web vulnerabilities and phishing attacks, Edge managed to stop 53% of them, followed by Google Chrome at 47% and Dia at 46%. In contrast, Perplexity's Comet and ChatGPT Atlas stopped only 7% and 5.8% of malicious web pages. 

From The Conversation:

Sandboxing is a security approach designed to keep websites isolated and prevent malicious code from accessing data from other tabs. The modern web depends on this separation. But in Atlas, the AI agent isn't malicious code — it's a trusted user with permission to see and act across all sites. This undermines the core principle of browser isolation.

Science can deal with God in at least three ways: showing how God is not necessary; showing how God is likely; not relating to God at all. Is only one way best? Atheists claim that scientific explanation eliminates for a ‘God of the gaps’. Theists point to the beauty of mathematics and the cosmos all resulting in human sentience and experience.

The process of training a model on new, specific knowledge like internal company documents or a complex reasoning task is notoriously expensive, time-consuming, and fraught with pitfalls. We want smaller, more efficient models that can master a domain without the compute budget of a tech giant.\
The core idea behind making smaller models smarter is a concept called "distillation." In this process, a smaller "student" model learns from a larger, more capable "teacher" model. The student doesn't just learn from a static textbook of examples; it learns to mimic the teacher's thought process. This is a powerful shortcut for transferring expertise.\
Until now, however, engineers have faced a frustrating trade-off. One approach, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), forces the student to learn from its own mistakes, which is relevant but painfully slow. The alternative, off-policy distillation, is much faster but dangerously flawed; the student learns from the teacher's ideal examples, which often occur in contexts the student will never encounter on its own, causing errors to compound. This has been the bottleneck for creating specialized AI; until now.\
A powerful technique called "on-policy distillation" combines the best of both worlds. By having a teacher model provide dense, token-by-token feedback on the student model's own attempts, we can achieve breakthroughs in training efficiency and capability. Here are the four most surprising and impactful takeaways from this approach.A Smarter Feedback Loop Makes AI Training Up to 100x CheaperThe fundamental difference between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Distillation lies in the density of the feedback. To understand this, imagine learning to play chess. is like learning chess by only being told if you won or lost at the very end of a match. The feedback is directly related to your actions, but it's sparse. You know you lost, but you don't know if it was because of your opening, a mid-game blunder, or a weak endgame. is like watching a grandmaster play. You observe brilliant moves, but they are made in complex board positions that you, as a novice, will rarely find yourself in. The feedback is dense, but the context is often irrelevant to your own learning path. provides the best of both worlds. It's like having an expert coach who grades every single one of your moves in your own games, telling you if a move was a "blunder," "inaccuracy," or "brilliant." The feedback is both dense and perfectly relevant to your current skill level.\
This smarter feedback loop has a massive impact on efficiency. In a direct back-to-back comparison where a student model learned from a teacher trained via RL, on-policy distillation allowed the student to reach the teacher's performance level 7-10 times faster in terms of gradient steps. This translates to a staggering 50-100x improvement in cumulative compute efficiency.\
The reason for this dramatic speedup is that on-policy distillation provides more useful information (more "bits per episode") for the model to learn from. Because this dense, token-level feedback reduces gradient noise, it allows for training with shorter contexts and smaller, more efficient batch sizes, further slashing the overall computational cost.You Can Cure “AI Amnesia” When Teaching New KnowledgeA common and frustrating problem in AI is "catastrophic forgetting." When you take a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on new, specialized information (like your company's internal knowledge base), it often degrades or completely forgets its original, general-purpose skills, such as the ability to follow instructions.\
Consider an experiment to create an "internal assistant." Researchers started with the Qwen3-8B model, which had a strong instruction-following score of 85%. After fine-tuning it on a 70-30 mix of internal company documents and general chat data:Its knowledge about the documents improved significantly (from 18% to 36% on a QA evaluation).However, its instruction-following skill degraded badly, dropping from 85% down to 79%.\
The solution was a brief phase of on-policy distillation after the initial fine-tuning. By using the original version of the model as the teacher, researchers could restore the lost behavior. The results were powerful:Instruction-following performance was almost fully recovered, jumping back up to 83%.Crucially, this happened without losing the newly acquired knowledge. In fact, the knowledge score even improved slightly to 41%.\
This finding is a game-changer for "continual learning," aka the ability to update models with new information over time without having to perform expensive, full-scale retraining from scratch. It provides a reliable way to teach an AI new facts without it forgetting its core skills.An AI Can Master a Reasoning Skill From Just One ExampleThis finding is highly counterintuitive. In most AI training methods, repeatedly training a model on the exact same prompt is a recipe for failure; the model simply memorizes the answer instead of learning the underlying skill.\
However, an experiment with on-policy distillation turned this assumption on its head. Researchers trained a student model on a math reasoning task using only a single, randomly chosen prompt. They trained on this one prompt for 20 consecutive steps, each with a batch of 256 rollouts, generating 5,120 total learning sequences.\
The remarkable outcome turns conventional wisdom on its head: the student model was able to approximately match the performance of the expert teacher model on the AIME'24 math benchmark, despite only ever having seen that one problem.\
This works because on-policy distillation teaches the model to approximate the teacher's entire thought process; its full probability distribution for what the next best token should be at every step, rather than just memorizing a final answer. This means that for certain skills, the bottleneck isn't finding thousands of examples, but creating a single, perfectly-guided learning experience.Why "Practicing" on Its Own Samples Can Make an AI DumberIt seems logical that if a model produces a high-quality output, you could feed that output back into its training data to reinforce good behavior. This method, known as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on on-policy data, is like having the model "practice" on its own best work.\
But researchers found the opposite to be true. When they trained a model using a dataset composed of its own samples, its performance on an instruction-following evaluation actually degraded.\
The technical reason for this failure is subtle but critical. While the dataset of the model's own outputs might be perfectly on-policy on average, every finite batch of data exhibits a slightly different distribution. Training on these batches causes the model’s internal policy to drift away from its original state. This process turns training on its own samples into a form of off-policy training over time, leading to the same compounding error and divergence seen in other flawed methods.\
In contrast, on-policy distillation is completely stable in this self-distillation scenario. Because the teacher model remains a fixed, consistent target, the student can robustly converge on the desired behavior without degrading. This further cements on-policy distillation as a superior and more reliable tool for behavior refinement and continual learning.The Future of AI is Smaller, Faster, and More PersonalOn-policy distillation is more than just another training technique; it's a foundational shift in how we create specialized, expert AI. By combining the direct relevance of learning from one's own actions with the incredible efficiency of dense, token-by-token feedback, it solves some of the biggest challenges in applied AI.\
The benefits are clear: massive compute savings, a cure for catastrophic forgetting, and unbelievable data efficiency. This is a key enabling technology that lowers the barrier to entry, unlocking the ability for more teams to build and maintain custom models that possess deep domain knowledge without sacrificing core capabilities. This democratization of expert AI will fuel new business models and create competitive advantages previously reserved for frontier labs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/ai-researchers-embodied-an-llm-into-a-robot-and-it-started-channeling-robin-williams/</link><author>Julie Bort</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI researchers at Andon Labs embedded various LLMs in a vacuum robot to test how ready they were to be embodied.

But MIT physicists have unveiled a groundbreaking alternative that "used the atom's own electrons as probes to momentarily enter the nucleus..."



In research published in Science, a team of MIT physicists achieved exceptionally precise measurements of the energy of electrons orbiting a radium atom that had been chemically bonded with a fluoride atom to form radium monofluoride. By studying these molecules, the researchers created a kind of miniature particle collider. Within this environment, the electrons surrounding the radium atom were confined closely enough to occasionally slip into the nucleus before returning to their usual orbits... When those electrons returned to their outer paths, they retained the altered energy, effectively carrying a "message" from within the nucleus that could be decoded to reveal its internal arrangement... 

[The researchers] trapped and cooled the molecules and sent them through a system of vacuum chambers, into which they also sent lasers, which interacted with the molecules. In this way, the researchers were able to precisely measure the energies of electrons inside each molecule. When the researchers analyzed their measurements, they noticed that the electrons carried slightly different energies than expected if they had remained outside the nucleus. The difference was incredibly small, only about one millionth of the energy of the laser photon used to excite the molecules, but it was clear evidence that the electrons had entered the radium nucleus and interacted with its protons and neutrons... 

The researchers plan to use this new technique to create a detailed map of how forces are distributed inside the nucleus... to chart the nucleus with greater precision and search for possible violations of fundamental symmetries in nature. 

"It is thought that additional sources of fundamental symmetry violation are required to explain the almost complete absence of antimatter in our universe," the article points out. "Such violations could be seen within the nuclei of certain atoms such as radium... 


"Unlike most atomic nuclei, which are spherical in shape, the radium atom's nucleus has a more asymmetrical configuration, similar to a pear. Scientists predict that this pear shape could significantly enhance their ability to sense the violation of fundamental symmetries, to the extent that they may be potentially observable."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>German arms exports: No more rules? | Mapped Out</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNcj2pYEsIQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pNcj2pYEsIQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 14:15:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On paper, Germany has strict rules and human rights criteria for arms exports.

As software scales, so does the energy it consumes and the emissions it generates.This growing footprint forms what many engineers now call carbon debt: the accumulation of energy waste caused by inefficient architecture, redundant compute, or neglected cleanup.The problem isn’t limited to theory anymore. Global data workloads are rising faster than the efficiency gains meant to offset them, and few teams have the tools to measure what their systems actually emit.Because engineers control how and where code runs, real progress starts inside development workflows, not in boardrooms.As carbon visibility moves closer to the code itself, software projects may soon be judged not only by speed and stability, but by how responsibly they use the power behind them.Teams talk about technical debt every sprint. They track code smells, refactoring needs, module complexity, and build bloat. But almost no one tracks the energy drain built into their systems, and this makes that blind spot real.\
Every inefficiency in code, like extra loops, redundant database fetches, and idle background tasks, translates into power use. Run thousands or millions of times per day, and what feels trivial becomes measurable emissions. Researchers have begun quantifying this: for example, the Green Algorithms framework shows that compute time, memory usage, and data center efficiency can be converted into carbon equivalent estimates for any computational task.\
At the data center scale, inefficiencies amplify. One white-paper found that servers may draw 60% to 90% of their peak power even while idle. Multiply that across dozens of servers, and weeks of wasted cycles become dozens of kilograms of CO2 equivalent.\
Every product team now operates with an invisible balance sheet, one that records carbon alongside complexity.The term carbon debt originates in environmental accounting, where it describes the accumulated emissions a system or entity has “borrowed” against future budgets with insufficient offsets. (It’s rooted in the broader notion of ecological or climate debt.) Now, technologists are borrowing that phrase to describe software systems whose inefficiencies accrue hidden energy costs over time.\
In software, carbon debt grows when layers of redundant code, over-provisioned infrastructure, and heavy frameworks persist unchecked. A module that spawns unnecessary background jobs, or a service that overfetches data, burns CPU cycles, which burn power.\
When infrastructure is sized with generous headroom “just in case,” that slack often stays underutilized, yet still draws baseline power. Servers and services often draw between 27% and 36% of peak power even under light load.\
As your system advances with more users, more services, and more replicas, each inefficiency multiplies. What once was a single wasted cycle becomes thousands per second. That energy waste endures unless addressed, compounding like interest owed on an invisible balance.\
Next, we’ll trace how code builds up emissions so you can see where the debt really comes from.How Code Accrues EmissionsThe energy footprint of software often hides in the smallest details of its logic. A loop that runs one step too long or a recursive function that never terminates efficiently can keep processors active far longer than needed. Each extra millisecond of compute draws power, and the effect multiplies when thousands of users trigger the same function at once.How Tiny Loops Turn Into Big CostsResearch on mobile software shows that energy code smells can dramatically increase consumption, and in some cases, they can consume up to 87x more energy than clean versions. Follow-up work found that fixing these patterns delivered 4% to 30% efficiency gains in practice. These results reinforce the broader point: repetitive, seemingly minor patterns accumulate real power draw over time.\
Similar waste appears in everyday engineering habits: redundant database queries, unnecessary front-end re-renders, and dormant API endpoints all keep processors active, drawing power without improving performance.\
Over-sized build artifacts and idle background tasks deepen the impact by holding memory and storage resources active long after they’re useful. When these patterns run across millions of daily transactions, the emissions scale from grams to kilograms of CO2. Quantifying that footprint is the next challenge, and few teams yet have the tools to do it precisely.Measuring What We Don’t SeeTracking how much energy software really uses is harder than it sounds. The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) framework from the Green Software Foundation is one of the first real attempts to make that measurable, like mapping compute time, memory use, and data transfer against actual energy data.\
Tools such as Cloud Carbon Footprint and CodeCarbon are now taking that formula a step further, embedding energy estimates directly into build pipelines and dashboards so developers can see environmental impact alongside performance metrics. This aligns with broader conversations inside the DevOps community, where teams are beginning to explore practical ways to embed sustainability into build and deployment workflows.\
The challenge is translating code execution into physical terms. Every watt drawn depends on processor type, cooling efficiency, and the carbon intensity of the grid that powers the data center. The same workload might have a fraction of the emissions on renewable-heavy infrastructure compared to fossil-fueled grids.\
The logic behind these tools isn’t far from how predictive analytics is being used to expose hidden operational costs in other industries, turning guesswork into measurable insight. Until this kind of visibility becomes standard in developer environments, most teams will keep optimizing performance while staying blind to the energy behind it.The Governance Gap: Why Carbon Isn’t Yet a Coding MetricSustainability still sits outside most engineering workflows. In many companies, carbon reporting lives with facilities or operations teams, not with the people writing or deploying code.\
As a result, the energy cost of a release is rarely discussed in sprint planning or post-mortems. Agile ceremonies track velocity, story points, and error rates, but not emissions.Few DevOps environments include “carbon sprints” or carbon budgets, even though they could be tracked the same way as uptime or latency. A report based on responses from over 2,000 software practitioners has found that most organizations are still in the early stages of measuring software-related emissions. Others echoed this, noting that sustainability metrics remain largely absent from continuous-integration and delivery pipelines.\
That gap is beginning to close. Some open-source communities have started experimenting with “green commits” to tag energy-efficient changes, and enterprise dashboards are beginning to surface sustainability data next to performance KPIs. As this visibility improves, design priorities are shifting toward decay and restraint by building systems that know when to slow down, scale back, or shut off entirely.Designing for Decay: Making Efficiency a DefaultArchitects concerned with long-lived systems often speak of architectural erosion or design decay, like the gradual divergence between intended structure and runtime reality. Architecture erosion is a well-known risk in systems as features accumulate and shortcuts proliferate. One way to counter that drift is to build systems that self-optimize or sunset unused processes automatically, pruning inactive modules or trimming underutilized services based on real usage signals.Treating code decay as a feature means embedding routines that perform periodic cleanup: archiving stale APIs, retiring dormant modules, or enforcing dependency hygiene. Frameworks may require that libraries unused for X releases be flagged or removed. Over time, the shift moves from “unlimited scaling” toward sustainable scaling, systems designed to shrink or sleep when load is low rather than running flat out forever.\
Engineers can use runtime profiling, build monitoring, and garbage-collection heat maps as signals. If a microservice’s CPU utilization stays near zero for weeks, it raises a refactor or archive flag. If build artifacts grow without change, they are flagged for pruning.\
This philosophy sets the stage for what’s next: making carbon visibility part of everyday decision-making, and bringing engineering metrics and emissions metrics into the same ecosystem.The Road to Carbon TransparencyImagine an IDE where each file, function, or commit carries a live “emissions counter”; you write a loop, and you see how much energy it might cost. That’s the direction software tooling is heading. Build tools could come to flag carbon-heavy changes before they’re merged.\
CI/CD pipelines will evolve to flag carbon-intensive builds, perhaps even rejecting code that spikes emissions far above baseline. With tighter integration, carbon metrics will merge with performance dashboards, showing build time, throughput, and CO2 cost in one pane.Cloud Dashboards & Deployment TransparencyCloud providers may expose per-deployment carbon cost insights, mapping workload emissions to regions, instance types, and schedules. The same principle underpins the idea of carbon-aware computing, where workloads shift dynamically to regions or times with cleaner grids. Integrating that into the same console where devs monitor CPU, bandwidth, and billing makes sustainability part of everyday trade-offs.\
With visibility in place, engineers will begin to optimize not just for latency or memory, but for carbon as a first-class metric. Those insights will shape budgeting decisions, drive architecture choices (edge, serverless, off-peak scheduling), and enforce sustainable defaults in code.\
Ahead lies a time when your pull request comes with a carbon delta and teams judge changes not only by correctness or performance, but by how much energy they add or save.Engineering AccountabilitySustainability in software doesn’t start in a server farm, but it starts at the keyboard. Every query, commit, and deployment decision shapes the energy profile of the systems we run. For years, efficiency meant speed and uptime, and now it also means restraint.\
Across the industry, teams are beginning to treat carbon debt the same way they treat technical debt: as something that compounds if ignored. Cleaning up unused code, right-sizing infrastructure, or pausing idle jobs are no longer side tasks; they’re acts of maintenance that protect performance and the planet.\
As tooling matures, carbon visibility will become part of normal governance, sitting next to reliability and security in every build report. The responsibility won’t rest with operations alone but with every engineer who touches code. Because in modern software, clean code and clean energy belong to the same conversation, and writing one well means caring about the other.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go: Can It Mitigate Supply Chain Attacks?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/go-can-it-mitigate-supply-chain-attacks?source=rss</link><author>Go [Technical Documentation]</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 14:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern software engineering is collaborative, and based on reusing Open Source software. That exposes targets to supply chain attacks, where software projects are attacked by compromising their dependencies.\
Despite any process or technical measure, every dependency is unavoidably a trust relationship. However, the Go tooling and design help mitigate risk at various stages.There is no way for changes in the outside world—such as a new version of a dependency being published—to automatically affect a Go build.\
Unlike most other package managers files, Go modules don’t have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the  file of the main module.\
Since Go 1.16, this determinism is enforced by default, and build commands (, , , , …) will fail if the go.mod is incomplete. The only commands that will change the  (and therefore the build) are  and . These commands are not expected to be run automatically or in CI, so changes to dependency trees must be made deliberately and have the opportunity to go through code review.\
This is very important for security, because when a CI system or new machine runs , the checked-in source is the ultimate and complete source of truth for what will get built. There is no way for third parties to affect that.\
Moreover, when a dependency is added with , its transitive dependencies are added at the version specified in the dependency’s  file, not at their latest versions, thanks to Minimal version selection. The same happens for invocations of go install example.com/cmd/devtoolx@latest, the equivalents of which in some ecosystems bypass pinning. In Go, the latest version of  will be fetched, but then all the dependencies will be set by its  file.\
If a module gets compromised and a new malicious version is published, no one will be affected until they explicitly update that dependency, providing the opportunity to review the changes and time for the ecosystem to detect the event.Version contents never changeAnother key property necessary to ensure third parties can’t affect builds is that the contents of a module version are immutable. If an attacker that compromises a dependency could re-upload an existing version, they could automatically compromise all projects that depend on it.\
That’s what the  file is for. It contains a list of cryptographic hashes of each dependency that contributes to the build. Again, an incomplete  causes an error, and only  and  will modify it, so any changes to it will accompany a deliberate dependency change. Other builds are guaranteed to have a full set of checksums.\
This is a common feature of most lock files. Go goes beyond it with the Checksum Database (sumdb for short), a global append-only cryptographically-verifiable list of go.sum entries. When  needs to add an entry to the  file, it fetches it from the sumdb along with cryptographic proof of the sumdb integrity. This ensures that not only every build of a certain module uses the same dependency contents, but that every module out there uses the same dependency contents!\
The sumdb makes it impossible for compromised dependencies or even Google-operated Go infrastructure to target specific dependents with modified (e.g. backdoored) source. You’re guaranteed to be using the exact same code that everyone else who’s using e.g. v1.9.2 of  is using and has reviewed.\
Finally, my favorite features of the sumdb: it doesn’t require any key management on the part of module authors, and it works seamlessly with the decentralized nature of Go modules.The VCS is the source of truthMost projects are developed through some version control system (VCS) and then, in other ecosystems, uploaded to the package repository. This means there are two accounts that could be compromised, the VCS host and the package repository, the latter of which is used more rarely and more likely to be overlooked. It also means it’s easier to hide malicious code in the version uploaded to the repository, especially if the source is routinely modified as part of the upload, for example to minimize it.\
In Go, there is no such thing as a package repository account. The import path of a package embeds the information that needs in order to fetch its module directly from the VCS, where tags define versions.\
We do have the Go Module Mirror, but that’s only a proxy. Module authors don’t register an account and don’t upload versions to the proxy. The proxy uses the same logic that the  tool uses (in fact, the proxy runs ) to fetch and cache a version. Since the Checksum Database guarantees that there can be only one source tree for a given module version, everyone using the proxy will see the same result as everyone bypassing it and fetching directly from the VCS. (If the version is not available anymore in the VCS or if its contents changed, fetching directly will lead to an error, while fetching from the proxy might still work, improving availability and protecting the ecosystem from “left-pad” issues.)\
Running VCS tools on the client exposes a pretty large attack surface. That’s another place the Go Module Mirror helps: the  tool on the proxy runs inside a robust sandbox and is configured to support every VCS tool, while the default is to only support the two major VCS systems (git and Mercurial). Anyone using the proxy can still fetch code published using off-by-default VCS systems, but attackers can’t reach that code in most installations.Building code doesn’t execute itIt is an explicit security design goal of the Go toolchain that neither fetching nor building code will let that code execute, even if it is untrusted and malicious. This is different from most other ecosystems, many of which have first-class support for running code at package fetch time. These “post-install” hooks have been used in the past as the most convenient way to turn a compromised dependency into compromised developer machines, and to worm through module authors.\
To be fair, if you’re fetching some code it’s often to execute it shortly afterwards, either as part of tests on a developer machine or as part of a binary in production, so lacking post-install hooks is only going to slow down attackers. (There is no security boundary within a build: any package that contributes to a build can define an  function.) However, it can be a meaningful risk mitigation, since you might be executing a binary or testing a package that only uses a subset of the module’s dependencies. For example, if you build and execute  on macOS there is no way for a Windows-only dependency or a dependency of example.com/cmd/othertool to compromise your machine.\
In Go, modules that don’t contribute code to a specific build have no security impact on it.“A little copying is better than a little dependency”The final and maybe most important software supply chain risk mitigation in the Go ecosystem is the least technical one: Go has a culture of rejecting large dependency trees, and of preferring a bit of copying to adding a new dependency. It goes all the way back to one of the Go proverbs: “a little copying is better than a little dependency”. The label “zero dependencies” is proudly worn by high-quality reusable Go modules. If you find yourself in need of a library, you’re likely to find it will not cause you to take on a dependency on dozens of other modules by other authors and owners.\
That’s enabled also by the rich standard library and additional modules (the  ones), which provide commonly used high-level building blocks such as an HTTP stack, a TLS library, JSON encoding, etc.\
All together this means it’s possible to build rich, complex applications with just a handful of dependencies. No matter how good the tooling is, it can’t eliminate the risk involved in reusing code, so the strongest mitigation will always be a small dependency tree.\

Is Halloween over? Technically yes. But as lovers of spooky season will know, the fallout from Halloween—when dawn reveals the remains of the festivities—is an extension of the day itself. That is why I have assembled a parade of horrors for you this morning.First, ancient mummies from a watery grave. Then: : let’s get tangled up in one of the great mysteries of spider webs; watch out for the venomous snakes; and lastly, scientists literally ask where the bodies are buried. And now, Halloween is over but the darkness lingers on…Prepare to enter the “mummy zone”If you think human mummies are scary, wait until you meet dinosaur mummies. Paleontologists have discovered the mummified remains of two duck-billed dinosaurs that belong to the species (go Oilers!) , which lived 66 million years ago in what is now Wyoming. The immaculate preservation of the animals—a 2-year-old juvenile and young adult that was roughly 5 to 8 years old—exposed unprecedented corporeal details, such as intricate polygonal scales, spinal spikes, fleshy contours, skin wrinkles, and the first hooves ever identified in a dinosaur (or any reptile), making them the oldest hooves in the fossil record.“The late juvenile is the first subadult dinosaur mummy on record and the first large-bodied dinosaur preserving the fleshy midline over the trunk,” said researchers led by Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago. “The early adult is the first hadrosaurid to preserve the entire spike row from hips to tail tip and the first reptile preserving wedge-shaped pedal hooves.”These “end-Cretaceous  preserve the oldest hoof renderings for any tetrapod, the first record of hooves in a reptile” and “the first instance of a hooved tetrapod capable of bipedal locomotion,” the team added.For more than a century, paleontologists have discovered dinosaur mummies in what the team delightfully calls the “mummy zone” of the Lance Formation of east-central Wyoming. In addition to adding new specimens to this collection, Sereno and his colleagues have also shed light on the rare process of “clay templating” that produces this preservation of mummified flesh, skin, and other soft tissues. As the carcasses of these Edmontosaurs dried in the Cretaceous sun, they were suddenly immersed under a flash flood that left a thin biofilm over their skin, preserving the three-dimensional soft tissues in time. The team concluded that “the extraordinary preservation of the ‘mummy zone’ is due to rapid subsidence in a coastal setting subject to seasonal drought-flood cycles.”While it’s sad that these dinos died young, it’s a miracle that we can observe their flesh, skin, and hooves 66 million years later. Anyway, it’s not as if they had much to look forward to, since the die was already cast for the non-avian dinosaurs. In this case, the die is an apocalyptic space rock to which we humans owe our existence—and the reality of these cosmic gambles of fate is frankly scarier than any mummy, even a  mummy, ever could be.Deck the halls with stabilimentaHalloween revelers will be taking down their decorative spider-web today, but real spiders keep their web decor up all year long. Researchers have long struggled to make sense of the silky zigzag ornaments that some spiders weave, known as “stabilimenta,” which could serve as insect attractors, predator defense, thermal protection, or water collection. Nobody is really sure!Now, a team has suggested that stabilimenta might be vibrational amplifiers that help alert spiders to prey impacting the web. “No studies have yet investigated how web decorations affect vibration propagation in orb webs,” said researchers led by Gabriele Greco of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. By studying wasp spiders in Sardinia, the team found that in certain cases, ”the presence of the stabilimentum enhances the spider’s ability to detect prey location…compared to webs without a stabilimentum.”“However, from a biological standpoint, the high variability in stabilimentum geometry suggests that the observed differences in elastic wave propagation are unlikely to have a consistent or significant functional role,” the team added. In other words, these web decorations still defy a one-size-fits-all explanation. My own hypothesis is that they are just the dorm room posters of the spider world.A new antivenom bites backThough I am a militant , even I can see how a clade of dangerous limbless weirdos ended up becoming so widely feared and maligned. Snakes kill tens of thousands of people per year, an ongoing tragedy that has galvanized researchers to develop antivenom “cocktails” that could treat snakebit emergencies across many species while also mitigating adverse immunological reactions.  A new study has now addressed this challenge “by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and rinkhals,” said researchers led by Shirin Ahmadi of the Technical University of Denmark. The cocktail “effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species” and “shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids,” the team added. While it will take much more research to prove it is safe and effective in humans, the antivenom is a significant step toward preventing snakebite deaths and injuries. It's also about the only cocktail that you hope you’ll never have the desire to order.The more (dead), the merrierWe’ll close on that most hallowed of Halloween traditions—a trip to the haunted cemetery.In an unprecedented study, researchers mapped out tens of thousands of ancient Chinese tombs spanning the past 4,000 years since the Xia Dynasty. The team used mapping software to analyze the age and location of the tombs to search for clues about the social and political impacts on burial locations.  “The number of ancient tombs varied significantly across historical periods” with the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) accounting for 47.012 percent of the national total, while the Sui dynasty (581 - 618) had only 0.134 percent, according to researchers led by Quanbao Ma of the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture.“From a temporal perspective, periods of frequent dynastic transitions and wars in Chinese history were often accompanied by significant population declines and migrations,” the team added. “However, during post-war recovery and periods of societal stability, population numbers typically rebounded and grew rapidly, which was also reflected in the increasing number of deceased individuals requiring burial.”In other words, contrary to Halloween lore, it can be a good sign to find a lot of dead bodies in one place because it’s often an indicator of more peaceful and stable times (dead bodies, after all, are the product of living ones). What might be more creepy is an absence of graves in your general vicinity. With that in mind, go visit your local ghosts; they are great company this time of year.Thanks for reading!

In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.
Overall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.
Naturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.
Having established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).
The WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.
This allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.
When another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.
This is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.
Modifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.
This is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.
For some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.
This seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.
From the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.
So we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.
During normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.
In versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.
While most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.
That and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.
EF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating Interceptors.
With an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just "not" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.
The overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.
So, I decided on three locking strategies:As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override  in .Optimistic locking behavior​Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to "Try and Retry and Retry ..." for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.
This still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.Jellyfin uses the  library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.Pessimistic locking behavior​Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.
This however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table "Alice" while writing to table "Bob" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.
While this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.Jellyfin uses a ReaderWriterLockSlim to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.The future Smart locking behavior​In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.
There have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a "ready to drop in" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.
Jellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Do you know that there is an HTML tables API?</title><link>https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/08/abandonware-of-the-web-do-you-know-that-there-is-an-html-tables-api/</link><author>begoon</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 12:58:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When people turn data into  tables using JavaScript, they either use the  methods (createElement() and the likes), but most of the time just append a huge string and use innerHTML, which always is a security concern. However, did you know that  tables also have an old, forgotten  ? Using this one, you can loop over tables, create bodies, rows, cells, heads, footers, captions an summaries (yes,  tables have all of those) and access the table cells. Without having to re-render the whole table on each change. Check out the Codepen to see how you can create a table from a nested array:let table 
let b  document.
let t  document.
b.t
table.rowri
  let r  t.ri
  row.li
    let c  r.i
    c. llet table = [
  ['one','two','three'],
  ['four','five','six']
];
let b = document.body;
let t = document.createElement('table');
b.appendChild(t);
table.forEach((row,ri) => {
  let r = t.insertRow(ri);
  row.forEach((l,i) => {
    let c = r.insertCell(i);
    c.innerText = l;  
  })
});You can then access each table cell with an index (with t being a reference to the table):console.t..console.log(t.rows[1].cells[1]);
// => <td>five</td>You can also delete and create cells and rows, if you want to add a row to the end of the table with a cell, all you need to do is:t.
t..
t...t.insertRow(-1);
t.rows[2].insertCell(0);
t.rows[2].cells[0].innerText = 'foo';There are a few things here that are odd – adding a -1 to add a row at the end for example – and there seems to be no way to create a TH element instead of a TD. All table cells are just cells.However, seeing how much of a pain it is to create tables, it would be fun to re-visit this  and add more functionality to it. We did add a lot of things to  forms, like formData and the change event, so why not add events and other features to tables. That way they’d finally get the status as data structures and not a hack to layout content on the web.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PCI Resizable BAR Improvements Heading To Linux 6.19</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/PCI-ReBAR-Better-Linux-6.19</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 12:35:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Restructuring to the Linux kernel's PCI Resizable BAR "ReBAR" support is set to be submitted for the upcoming Linux 6.19 kernel cycle...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Serbians gather to commemorate Novi Sad tragedy | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZpAJQD7acE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mZpAJQD7acE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 12:33:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands across Serbia are set to join a rally in Novi Sad in the coming hours, to mark one year since a fatal railway station roof collapse.

But earlier this month, bureaucrats in charge of federal lands scrapped collective approval for the Esmeralda 7 projects, in what campaigners fear is part of an attack on renewable energy under President Donald Trump. "We will not approve wind or farmer destroying [sic] Solar," he posted on his Truth Social platform in August. Developers will need to reapply individually, slowing progress.
 
Thousands of miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is a different story. China has laid solar panels across an area the size of Chicago high up on the Tibetan Plateau, where the thin air helps more sunlight get through. The Talatan Solar Park is part of China's push to double its solar and wind generation capacity over the coming decade. "Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time," President Xi Jinping told delegates at a UN summit in New York last month. China's vast production of solar panels and batteries has also pushed down the prices of renewables hardware for everyone else, meaning it has "become very difficult to make any other choice in some places," according to Heymi Bahar, senior analyst at the International Energy Agency. [...]
 
More broadly, the US's focus on fossil fuels and pullback of support for clean energy further cedes influence over the future global energy system to China. The US is trying to tie its trading partners into fossil fuels, pressing the EU to buy $750 billion of American oil, natural gas, and nuclear technologies during his presidency as part of a trade deal, scuppering an initiative to begin decarbonizing world shipping and pressuring others to reduce their reliance on Chinese technology. But the collapsing cost of solar panels in particular has spoken for itself in many parts of the world. Experts caution that the US's attacks on renewables could cause lasting damage to its competitiveness against China, even if an administration more favorable to renewables were to follow Trump's.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Euronews will host the first-ever EU Enlargement Summit in Brussels</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRZ9dRm5fYg</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aRZ9dRm5fYg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:21:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When Europe’s leaders have a message for Europeans, they share it first on Euronews.

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.

Musk's company has also been linked to two more satellite ventures, which are concerned with relaying sensitive communications and tracing vehicles, respectively.
 
Golden Dome, inspired by Israel's "Iron Dome," was announced by Trump and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth at the White House in May and will amount to a complex system of satellites and weaponry capable of destroying incoming missiles before they hit American targets. The president promised it would be "fully operational" before he leaves office in January 2029, capable of intercepting rockets, "even if they are launched from space," with an overall price tag of $175 billion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tanzania election unrest: A litmus test for President Hassan | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2aqSsamVreo</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2aqSsamVreo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 06:48:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tanzania's government has deployed the military, ordered a curfew in Dar es Salaam amid internet outages after violence broke out on election day.

Microsoft released its latest quarterly earnings report and proved the worst of our fears about its gaming brand. Not only are Xbox hardware sales down significantly, but the brand itself is barely treading water. Gamers are voicing their displeasure with their wallets, but Microsoft's top brass is still only thinking about the margins. Microsoft was more keen to promote the scale of its cloud and AI services revenue -- which was up 28% year over year -- than talk about its beleaguered gaming brand. The company's overall gaming revenue fell by 2% compared to the same time last year. This was precipitated by a "decline in Xbox hardware," which was down by 22% following a steady decline quarter after quarter. Its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription were doing better, though the overall growth was only up by 1%, and even that was driven by the "better-than-expected performance" of third-party games. You can give credit to titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for why Xbox isn't in an even deeper hole than it is now.
 
The tech giant has no expectation that its Xbox brand will start making more money anytime soon. In its earnings call with investors, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects Xbox will continue to decline "in the low to mid-single digits" for the following quarter. That's mostly due to the lack of landmark first-party titles. Just this month, Xbox released Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2, and Double Fine's The Keeper. Xbox also made a huge marketing push for its first handheld, made in partnership with Asus, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X. In any other year, this would be a big month for any gaming company. The dour outlook comes after months of bad news. After two subsequent price hikes, Xbox Series S and Series X consoles now cost between $100 to $150 more than they did at launch five years ago. Microsoft also pushed prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier from $20 to $30 per month. A full-year's subscription would now demand $360. In a separate article, Gizmodo reviews Microsoft's new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which "offers a better experience overall" than the "other small-scale Windows PC gaming devices released this year." However, "it's still nowhere close to what you truly want from a console."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The profitable startup</title><link>https://linear.app/now/the-profitable-startup</link><author>doppp</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 03:18:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For years, startups have been taught to prioritize growth over everything else. Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?But that thinking was always flawed.Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.Paul Graham famously wrote about "ramen profitability" – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks." Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.Understand Your Risk ProfileAre you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.Hire Intentionally and SlowerFor most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When AI And Secure Chat Meet, Users Deserve Strong Controls Over How They Interact</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/31/when-ai-and-secure-chat-meet-users-deserve-strong-controls-over-how-they-interact/</link><author>Thorin Klosowski</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 02:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Both Google and Apple are cramming new AI features into their phones and other devices, and neither company has offered clear ways to control which apps those AI systems can access. Recent issues around WhatsApp on both Android and iPhone demonstrate how these interactions can go sideways, risking revealing chat conversations beyond what you intend. Users deserve better controls and clearer documentation around what these AI features can access.After diving into how Google Gemini and Apple Intelligence (and in some cases Siri) currently work, we didn’t always find clear answers to questions about how data is stored, who has access, and what it can be used for.At a high level, when you compose a message with these tools, the companies can usually see the contents of those messages and receive at least a temporary copy of the text on their servers.When receiving messages, things get trickier. When you use an AI like Gemini or a feature like Apple Intelligence to summarize or read notifications, we believe companies should be doing that content processing on-device. But poor documentation and weak guardrails create issues that have lead us deep into documentation rabbit holes and still fail to clarify the privacy practices as clearly as we’d like.We’ll dig into the specifics below as well as potential solutions we’d like to see Apple, Google, and other device-makers implement, but first things first, here’s what you can do right now to control access:Control AI Access to Secure Chat on Android and iOSHere are some steps you can take to control access if you want nothing to do with the device-level AI features’ integration and don’t want to risk accidentally sharing the text of a message outside of the app you’re using.How to Check and Limit What Gemini Can AccessIf you’re using Gemini on your Android phone, it’s a good time to review your settings to ensure things are set up how you want. Here’s how to check each of the relevant settings:Disable Gemini App Activity: Gemini App Activity is a history Google stores of all your interactions with Gemini. It’s enabled by default. To disable it, open Gemini (depending on your phone model, you may or may not even have the Google Gemini app installed. If you don’t have it installed, you don’t really need to worry about any of this). Tap your  > then change the toggle to either “Turn off,” or “Turn off and delete activity” if you want to delete previous conversations. If the option reads “Turn on,” then Gemini Apps Activity is already turned off. Control app and notification access: You can control which apps Gemini can access by tapping your  > , then scrolling down and disabling the toggle next to any apps you do not want Gemini to access. If you do not want Gemini to potentially access the content that appears in notifications, open the Settings app and revoke notification access from the Google app.: Depending on your phone model, you might be able to delete the Gemini app and revert to using Google Assistant instead. You can do so by long-pressing the Gemini app and selecting the option to delete. How to Check and Limit what Apple Intelligence and Siri Can AccessSimilarly, there are a few things you can do to clamp down on what Apple Intelligence and Siri can do: Disable the “Use with Siri Requests” option: If you want to continue using Siri, but don’t want to accidentally use it to send messages through secure messaging apps, like WhatsApp, then you can disable that feature by opening  >  > , and disabling “Use with Siri Requests,” which turns off the ability to compose messages with Siri and send them through that app.Disable Apple Intelligence entirely: Apple Intelligence is an all-or-nothing setting on iPhones, so if you want to avoid any potential issues your only option is to turn it off completely. To do so, open  > Apple Intelligence & Siri, and disable “Apple Intelligence” (you will only see this option if your device supports Apple Intelligence, if it doesn’t, the menu will only be for “Siri”). You can also disable certain features, like “writing tools,” using Screen Time restrictions. Siri can’t be universally turned off in the same way, though you can turn off the options under “Talk to Siri” to make it so you can’t speak to it. For more information about cutting off AI access at different levels in other apps, this Consumer Reports article covers other platforms and services.Sending Messages Has Different Privacy Concerns than Receiving ThemLet’s start with a look at how Google and Apple integrate their AI systems into message composition, using WhatsApp as an example.Google Gemini and WhatsAppOn Android, you can optionally link WhatsApp and Gemini together so you can then initiate various actions for sending messages from the Gemini app, like “Call Mom on WhatsApp” or “Text Jason on WhatsApp that we need to cancel our secret meeting, but make it a haiku.” This feature raised red flags for users concerned about privacy.By default, everything you do in Gemini is stored in the “Gemini Apps Activity,” where messages are stored forever, subject to human review, and are used to train Google’s products. So, unless you change it, when you use Gemini to compose and send a message in WhatsApp then the message you composed is visible to Google.If you turn the activity off, interactions are still stored for 72 hours. Google’s documentation claims that even though messages are stored, those conversations aren’t reviewed or used to improve Google machine learning technologies, though that appears to be an internal policy choice with no technical limits preventing Google from accessing those messages.The simplicity of invoking Gemini to compose and send a message may lead to a false sense of privacy. Notably, other secure messaging apps, like Signal, do not offer this Gemini integration.For comparison’s sake, let’s see how this works with Apple devices.According to its privacy policy, when you dictate a message through Siri to send to WhatsApp (or anywhere else), the message, including metadata like the recipient phone number and other identifiers, is sent to Apple’s servers. This was confirmed by researchers to include the text of messages sent to WhatsApp. When you use Siri to compose a WhatsApp message, the message gets routed to both Apple and WhatsApp. Apple claims it does not store this transcript unless you’ve opted into “Improve Siri and Dictation.” WhatsApp defers to Apple’s support for data handling concerns. This is similar to how Google handles speech-to-text prompts.In response to that research, Apple said this was expected behavior with an app that uses SiriKit—the extension that allows third-party apps to integrate with Siri—like WhatsApp does.Both Siri and Apple Intelligence can sometimes run locally on-device, and other times need to rely on Apple-managed cloud servers to complete requests. Apple Intelligence can use the company’s Private Cloud Compute, but Siri doesn’t have a similar feature.The ambiguity around where data goes makes it overly difficult to decide on whether you are comfortable with the sort of privacy trade-off that using features like Siri or Apple Intelligence might entail.How Receiving Messages WorksSending encrypted messages is just one half of the privacy puzzle. What happens on the receiving end matters too. We could not find anything in Google’s Utilities documentation that clarifies what information is collected, stored, or sent to Google from these notifications. When we reached out to Google, the company responded that it “builds technical data protections that safeguard user data, uses data responsibly, and provides users with tools to control their Gemini experience.” Which means Google has no technical limitation around accessing the text from notifications if you’ve enabled the feature in the Utilities app. This could open up any notifications routed through the Utilities app to the Gemini app to be accessed internally or from third-parties. Google needs to publicly make its data handling explicit in its documentation.Apple is more clear about how it handles this sort of notification access.Siri can read and reply to messages with the “Announce Notifications” feature. With this enabled, Siri can read notifications out loud on select headphones or via CarPlay. In a press release, Apple states, “When a user talks or types to Siri, their request is processed on device whenever possible. For example, when a user asks Siri to read unread messages… the processing is done on the user’s device. The contents of the messages aren’t transmitted to Apple servers, because that isn’t necessary to fulfill the request.”Apple Intelligence can summarize notifications from any app that you’ve enabled notifications on. Apple is clear that these summaries are generated on your device, “when Apple Intelligence provides you with preview summaries of your emails, messages, and notifications, these summaries are generated by on-device models.” This means there should be no risk that the text of notifications from apps like WhatsApp or Signal get sent to Apple’s servers just to summarize them.New AI Features Must Come With Strong User ControlsAs more device-makers cram AI features into their devices, the more necessary it is for us to have clear and simple controls over what personal data these features can access on our devices. If users do not have control over when a text leaves a device for any sort of AI processing—whether that’s to a “private” cloud or not—it erodes our privacy and potentially threatens the foundations of end-to-end encrypted communications.Google, Apple, and other device makers should add a device-level AI permission, just like they do for other potentially invasive privacy features, like location sharing, to their phones. You should be able to tell the operating system’s AI to not access an app, even if that comes at the “cost” of missing out on some features. The setting should be straightforward and easy to understand in ways the Gemini an Apple Intelligence controls currently are not.Offer On-Device-Only ModesDevice-makers should offer an “on-device only” mode for those interested in using some features without having to try to figure out what happens on device or on the cloud. Samsung offers this, and both Google and Apple would benefit from a similar option.Both Google and Apple should improve their documentation about how these features interact with various apps. Apple doesn’t seem to clarify notification processing privacy anywhere outside of a press release, and we couldn’t find anything about Google’s Utilities privacy at all. We appreciate tools like Gemini Apps Activity as a way to audit what the company collects, but vague information like “Prompted a Communications query” is only useful if there’s an explanation somewhere about what that means.The current user options are not enough. It’s clear that the AI features device-makers add come with significant confusion about their privacy implications, and it’s time to push back and demand better controls. The privacy problems introduced alongside new AI features should be taken seriously, and remedies should be offered to both users and developers who want real, transparent safeguards over how a company accesses their private data and communications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI Launches Aardvark To Detect and Patch Hidden Bugs In Code</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2314223/openai-launches-aardvark-to-detect-and-patch-hidden-bugs-in-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 02:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI has introduced Aardvark, a GPT-5-powered autonomous agent that scans, reasons about, and patches code like a human security researcher. "By embedding itself directly into the development pipeline, Aardvark aims to turn security from a post-development concern into a continuous safeguard that evolves with the software itself," reports InfoWorld. From the report: What makes Aardvark unique, OpenAI noted, is its combination of reasoning, automation, and verification. Rather than simply highlighting potential vulnerabilities, the agent promises multi-stage analysis -- starting by mapping an entire repository and building a contextual threat model around it. From there, it continuously monitors new commits, checking whether each change introduces risk or violates existing security patterns.
 
Additionally, upon identifying a potential issue, Aardvark attempts to validate the exploitability of the finding in a sandboxed environment before flagging it. This validation step could prove transformative. Traditional static analysis tools often overwhelm developers with false alarms -- issues that may look risky but aren't truly exploitable. "The biggest advantage is that it will reduce false positives significantly," noted Jain. "It's helpful in open source codes and as part of the development pipeline."
 
Once a vulnerability is confirmed, Aardvark integrates with Codex to propose a patch, then re-analyzes the fix to ensure it doesn't introduce new problems. OpenAI claims that in benchmark tests, the system identified 92 percent of known and synthetically introduced vulnerabilities across test repositories, a promising indication that AI may soon shoulder part of the burden of modern code auditing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FCC To Rescind Ruling That Said ISPs Are Required To Secure Their Networks</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/237241/fcc-to-rescind-ruling-that-said-isps-are-required-to-secure-their-networks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 01:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The FCC plans to repeal a Biden-era ruling that required ISPs to secure their networks under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, instead relying on voluntary cybersecurity commitments from telecom providers. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said the ruling "exceeded the agency's authority and did not present an effective or agile response to the relevant cybersecurity threats." Carr said the vote scheduled for November 20 comes after "extensive FCC engagement with carriers" who have taken "substantial steps... to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses." Ars Technica reports: The FCC's January 2025 declaratory ruling came in response to attacks by China, including the Salt Typhoon infiltration of major telecom providers such as Verizon and AT&T. The Biden-era FCC found that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law, "affirmatively requires telecommunications carriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications."
 
"The Commission has previously found that section 105 of CALEA creates an affirmative obligation for a telecommunications carrier to avoid the risk that suppliers of untrusted equipment will "illegally activate interceptions or other forms of surveillance within the carrier's switching premises without its knowledge,'" the January order said. "With this Declaratory Ruling, we clarify that telecommunications carriers' duties under section 105 of CALEA extend not only to the equipment they choose to use in their networks, but also to how they manage their networks." A draft of the order that will be voted on in November can be found here (PDF).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Bending Spoons?

Sign up forKlaxon, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.\
One year after a Markup investigation revealed racial bias in Los Angeles’s housing intake system for people experiencing homelessness, local politicians have pressed for reforms and the agency responsible for housing is taking steps to make its approach more equitable and effective.\
Shortly after our original investigation published, Los Angeles City Council Member Nithya Raman, who chairs the Housing and Homelessness committee, introduced a motion citing the article and calling on the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) to come up with a plan to reform its intake system. The legislation, approved unanimously, called specifically for greater fairness in the “vulnerability” scoring system that The Markup analyzed. Used by Los Angeles for the past decade, the system rated Black people as significantly less vulnerable than White people year after year, making them less likely to obtain subsidized permanent housing.\
Black people are hugely overrepresented among unhoused people in L.A., making up about 9 percent of Los Angeles County’s population but about 30 percent of the county’s people experiencing homelessness.\
“To see that the tool that we’re using to put people in line for housing was not actually housing unhoused Black Angelenos as quickly as we could was really surprising to me,” said Raman, who read the article in the Los Angeles Times, where it was co-published. Raman, who is currently running for re-election in District Four, in central LA, said the investigation “absolutely” spurred the council to act.\
LAHSA, given a deadline of April 2023 in the legislation, still has not provided a reform plan. A spokesperson for the agency didn’t directly respond to a request for comment about the plan.\
Raman said LAHSA has taken some steps in the past year to improve how it allocates housing. Among other changes, she said, the agency has started to prioritize some groups, including those already involved in housing programs and those who already have the documents required to move into a building, like an ID and social security number.\
Meanwhile, the agency also de-emphasized the score’s importance in placing people for permanent housing. People applying for housing are scored on a 17-point scale. Previously, the people with the highest scores were given the highest priority, but now any person who scores an eight or above can be prioritized, depending on the other factors being considered.\
Still, equity in the housing system remains a known problem. In November, researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California Los Angeles, working in partnership with LAHSA, released a long-awaited study on racial bias in the system and ways to reform the scoring system, known as the VI-SPDAT.\
The study, which analyzed scores across race and ethnicity, tracked with The Markup’s findings from earlier in the year, concluding that the scoring tool is biased toward White people and that it’s ineffective overall. The study, in some respects, went even further. Using data on who ultimately faced an “adverse” event, like jail or death, the researchers concluded that tool was “not much more accurate than a random guess at predicting vulnerability.”\
The study suggested several ways the scoring system could become more accurate and equitable, some of which matched The Markup’s reporting. The scoring system asks intensely personal questions about a person’s life, including around issues like violence and substance abuse, and the report recommends rewording and reframing questions to make the survey less complex and more sensitive. A revised version of the system with new questions and scoring could substantially reduce bias, the researchers conclude.\
For example, the study suggests that the existing question about whether anyone has “forced you or tricked you to do things that you do not want to do” should be amended to stress that answering yes “will not result in punishment or any negative consequences.” Another question currently asks, “Are there any medications like painkillers that you don’t take the way the doctor prescribed or where you sell the medication?” The study suggested softening it to, “Do you have medication that you choose to sell instead of taking to help support yourself financially? Answering yes to this question will not result in punishment or negative consequences for you.” Several questions were suggested for removal entirely.\
In a written statement, LAHSA spokesperson Christopher Yee acknowledged that it’s long been clear that “the VI-SPDAT has shortcomings related to equity,” adding that the survey is “long, cumbersome, and not trauma-informed in the content of the questions or administration process.”\
Yee highlighted the study on recommended changes to the system and said the agency is “working with key partners and stakeholders to create a plan to implement and refine” a new iteration of the scoring system while it continues to use the old version.\
The agency, he noted, has already dropped a requirement to score people for interim housing entry or time-limited subsidy programs, but will still require scoring for permanent housing. LAHSA must use some sort of prioritization system to access certain federal housing funds under rules established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development.\
The planned changes to the scoring system will first apply to screening for adults, and later the agency plans to explore changes to related tools for young people and families with children. The Markup found that racial disparities were even more stark for a variation of the VI-SPDAT used in Los Angeles for people under the age of 25.\
Yee’s statement did not provide a timeline for the revised tool’s launch, but in a FAQ released alongside the study LAHSA said service providers could expect more information early this year on changes to the intake process, known as the Coordinated Entry System.\
Raman, for her part, said she’s withholding judgment until data can show how those changes affect who is housed. But, she said, “there’s no question in my mind that CES needs reform.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Up to 42 million US citizens depend on food aid, US courts order the govt to keep it open | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ8KFFFYSO4</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lZ8KFFFYSO4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 00:14:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal judges have ordered the US administration to continue funding SNAP, the country's largest food aid program.

The Ministry achieved this status by migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure. This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, to an open-source, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.
 
European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European." What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."
 
Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies. The organizations include the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the Austrian military, Danish government organizations, and the French city of Lyon. All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YouTube TV Loses ESPN, ABC and Other Disney Channels</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2017209/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Disney's channels, including ESPN, ABC, FX, and NatGeo, have gone dark on YouTube TV after Google and Disney failed to renew their carriage agreement before the October 30 deadline, with each side blaming the other for using unfair negotiating tactics and price hikes.

Engadget reports: "Last week Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers," YouTube said in an announcement on its blog. "They're now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV." YouTube added that Disney's decision harms its subscribers while benefiting its own live TV products, such as Hulu+Live TV and Fubo.

Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos TheoryDynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which
could be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that
determine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is
happening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a
population (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.There are two primary things to understand about this system:: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a
snapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be
represented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size
and the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population
dynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate
the changes in population size over time.Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of
possibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,
study systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in
relevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into
chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to
chaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability. is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional
deterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop
of ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,
pendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow
deterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,
might seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of
the time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex
systems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information
to make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially
observe) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a
completely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the
butterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems
are all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the
phase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,
towards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the
bottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of
the reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay
there. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This
loss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is
what happens in the case of the pendulum.: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This
contraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn
towards the attractor.Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These
nonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These
complex attractors are categorised as . They are called "strange" due to their unique
characteristics.: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate
patterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial
conditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known
as the "butterfly effect".Unpredictable Trajectories: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting
non-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by
deterministic rules.Emergent Order from Chaos: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.
Patterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the
butterfly effect.A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small
changes in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the
. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to
drastically different outcomes.In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the
attractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to
 in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles
eventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a
technique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,
minimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One
stores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs): We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and
next state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use
of GPU resources.Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics: The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to
each particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.Rendering and Buffer Swapping: In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's
equations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously
inactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.If you have any comments, please leave them on this GitHub discussions topic.

Observers regard it as one of the more anticipated community-driven launches of the year, comparable to projects such as Aster and Four.meme.Raising over $2 million within days of opening, BALZ has positioned itself as a significant project developing on BNB, despite its informal branding and memetic culture. With more than 40,000 members prior to its anticipated token presale, the project has adopted an unconventional approach to community growth through guerrilla marketing and its "rug pull recovery protocol."Instead of allocating capital to influencer campaigns, the team integrated communities from Solana and Base, migrating them to BNB through its protocol. At the time of writing, more than 10,000 verified holders are in the process of migration.The Token Presale: Closing Tonight, October 31st at 23:59 PDTAt the center of BALZ is the Fair-As-F* Launch (FAF), a limited-time token presale closing on October 31 at 23:59 PDT. Within days of opening, BALZ raised over $2 million, drawing parallels to earlier community-led launches such as Shiba Inu and Floki in 2020.FAF is structured with a fixed price and specific time frame, allowing equal participation without insider advantages or automated trading. In a market that has frequently favored early access and automation, BALZ seeks to show that fairness can be built into its design.BNB Market Conditions and TimingThe timing aligns with a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market. On October 10, 2025, the sector experienced its largest liquidation event to date, with $19 billion eliminated within 48 hours as Bitcoin declined from $126,000 to $105,000. This event represented market deleveraging rather than capitulation.Open interest decreased from $48.7 billion to $45.1 billionFunding rates fell by 51 percentOverleveraged positions were clearedThe result is a market now characterized by conviction-based participants and institutional capital seeking new deployment opportunities.Market structure mirrors 2020-2021 exactly:Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $2.71 billion during October 6-10, BlackRock's IBIT holding $65.26 billion85% of institutional firms now allocate to digital assetsFed rate cuts hit 93% probability for next quarterBNB Smart Chain Shows Continued Growth3.62 million daily active addresses in October 2025Total Value Locked surged 217% to $17.1 billion70% of BNB meme traders are currently profitableCZ is back. He changed his X profile from "ex-@binance" to "@binance" in September 2025. BNB hit an all-time high of $1,311. Real infrastructure that actually supports growth. BNB is where smart money is rotating.BALZ is capturing this momentum at the exact moment Solana and Base communities are looking for an exit. Market observers note the project is one CZ tweet away from a billion-dollar market cap, similar to previous meme token cycles where single endorsements rapidly accelerated valuations into nine-figure territory.The presale window closes October 31st at 23:59 PDT.Follow: X: @ | Telegram: t.me/BALZ_Official is a meme coin launching on Binance Smart Chain with a mission: to build the safest, fastest trading platform and no-code launchpad in crypto.

The company will, however, continue to allow legitimate sideloading for developers. Heise reports: In response to an inquiry, Amazon explained that it has always worked to ban piracy from its app store. As part of an expanded program led by the ACE, it is now blocking apps that demonstrably provide access to pirated content, including those downloaded outside the app store. This builds on Amazon's ongoing efforts to support creators and protect customers, as piracy can also expose users to malware, viruses, and fraud.
 
[...] The sideloading option will remain available on Fire TV devices running Amazon's new operating system, Vega OS. However, it is generally limited to developers here. In this context, the company emphasized that, contrary to rumors, there are no plans to upgrade existing Fire TV devices with Fire OS as the operating system to Vega OS.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tanzania opposition groups say ‘hundreds dead’ in post-election protests | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asocbkoeA1U</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/asocbkoeA1U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 22:48:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Authorities in Tanzania have imposed curfews and an internet blackout as post-election protests sweep the country.

Earlier in its European Council presidency, Denmark had brought back a draft law which would have required the scanning, sparking an intense backlash. Known as Chat Control, the measure was intended to crack down on the trafficking of child sex abuse materials (CSAM). After days of silence, the German government on October 8 announced it would not support the proposal, tanking the Danish effort.
 
Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told reporters on Thursday that his office will support voluntary CSAM detections. "This will mean that the search warrant will not be part of the EU presidency's new compromise proposal, and that it will continue to be voluntary for the tech giants to search for child sexual abuse material," Hummelgaard said, according to local news reports. The current model allowing for voluntary scanning expires in April, Hummelgaard said. "Right now we are in a situation where we risk completely losing a central tool in the fight against sexual abuse of children," he said. "That's why we have to act no matter what. We owe it to all the children who are subjected to monstrous abuse."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Three Key Races to Watch Ahead of Election Day 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmkMCb8Ry34</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wmkMCb8Ry34?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 22:09:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cook Political Report US House Editor Erin Covey previews the races to watch on Election Day including the NYC Mayoral race where Covey suggests Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani is likely to win as polling shows he has a double digit lead over Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo.

    succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to
    Grokipedia. Here are early impressions. · 
My Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a mere 1,300 in
    my Wikipedia article. It’s pretty clear how it was generated; an LLM, trained
    on who-knows-what but definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was told to go nuts.Speaking as a leading but highly biased expert on the subject of T. Bray, here are the key take-aways: · 
It covers all the territory; there is no phase of my life’s activity that could possibly be encountered in combing the Web
    that is not exhaustively covered. In theory this should be good but in fact, who cares about the details of what I worked on
    at Sun Microsystems between 2004 and 2010? I suppose I should but, like I said, I couldn’t force myself to plod all the way
    through it. · 
Every paragraph contains significant errors. Sometimes the text is explicitly self-contradictory on the face of it,
    sometimes the mistakes are subtle enough that only I would spot them. · 
The writing has that LLM view-from-nowhere flat-affect semi-academic flavor. I don’t like it but the evidence suggests that
    some people do? · 
All the references are just URLs and at least some of them entirely fail to support the text. Here’s an example. In
    discussion of my expert-witness work for the FTC in their litigation against Meta concerning its acquisitions of Instagram and
    WhatsApp, Grokipedia says:[Bray] opined that users' perceptions of response times in online services critically influence market
    dynamics.Anyhow, I (so that you won’t have to) spent a solid fifteen minutes spelunking back and forth through that FTC doc, looking
    for strings like “response time” and “latency” and so on. Maybe somewhere in those pages there’s support for the claim quoted
    above, but I couldn’t find it. · 
Wikipedia, in my mind, has two main purposes: A quick visit to find out the basics about some city or person or plant or
    whatever, or a deep-dive to find out what we  know about genetic linkages to autism or Bach’s relationship with
    Frederick the Great or whatever.At the moment, Grokipedia doesn’t really serve either purpose very well. But, after all, this is release 0.1, maybe we
    should give it a chance. · 
The whole point, one gathers, is to provide an antidote to Wikipedia’s alleged woke bias. So I dug into that. Let’s consider
    three examples of what I found.  First, from that same paragraph about the FTC opinion quoted above:While Bray and aligned progressives contend that such dominance stifles innovation by enabling predatory acquisitions and
      reduced rivalry—evidenced by fewer startup exits in concentrated sectors—counterarguments highlight that Big Tech's scale has
      fueled empirical gains, with these firms investing over $240 billion in U.S. R&D in 2024 (more than a quarter of national
      totals) and driving AI, cloud, and patent surges.[128]
      [131] Six tech industries alone accounted for
      over one-third of 
      U.S. GDP growth from 2012–2021, comprising about 9% of the 
      economy and sustaining 9.3 million jobs amid falling consumer prices and rapid technological diffusion.
      [132] 
      [133]
      Right-leaning economists often defend consumer welfare metrics and market self-correction, warning that forced divestitures
      risk eroding the efficiencies and investment incentives that have propelled sector productivity above 6% annual growth in key
      areas like durable manufacturing tech.
      [134]
      [135]I’ve linked the numbered citations to the indicated URLs. Maybe visit one or two of them and see what you think? Four are
    to articles arguing, basically, that monopolies must be OK because the companies accused of it are growing really fast and
    driving the economy. They seem mostly to be from right-wing think-tanks but I guess that’s what those think-tanks are for.  One
    of them, #131, Big Tech and the US Digital-Military-Industrial Complex, I think isn’t helpful to the argument at
    all. But still, it’s broadly doing what they advertise: Pushing back against “woke” positions, in this case the position that
    monopolization is bad.I looked at a couple of other examples.  For example, this is from the header of the Greta Thunberg article:While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate
      threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as
      well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.[5][6]Somehow I feel no urge to click on those citation links.If Ms Thunberg is out there on the “woke” end of the spectrum, let’s flit over to the other end, namely the entry for
    J.D. Vance, on the subject of his book .Critics from progressive outlets, including Sarah Smarsh in her 2018 book , faulted the memoir for
      overemphasizing personal and cultural failings at the expense of structural economic policies, arguing it perpetuated
      stereotypes of rural whites as self-sabotaging.[71] These objections, often rooted in institutional analyses from academia and
      media, overlooked data on behavioral patterns like opioid dependency rates—peaking at 21.5 deaths per 100,000 in Appalachia
      around 2016—that aligned with Vance's observations of "deaths of despair" precursors.[72]I read and enjoyed  but the citation is to a  article that doesn’t mention
    Smarsh. As for the second sentence… my first reaction as I trudged through its many clauses, was “life’s too short”.
    But seriously, opioid-death statistics weaken the hypothesis about structural economic issues? Don’t get it. · 
Wikipedia is,
    to quote myself, the encyclopedia that “anyone who’s willing to
    provide citations can edit”.
    Grokipedia is “the encyclopedia that Elon Musk’s LLM can edit, with sketchy citations and no progressive argument left
    un-attacked.”So I guess it’s Working As Intended?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GNOME Gains A New macOS-Inspired Quick Menu Option</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-Kiwi-macOS-Quick-Menu</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:41:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For GNOME desktop users desiring a more macOS-like experience, a new GNOME extension provides a macOS-inspired quick menu option...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>(Former) Prince Andrew&apos;s fall from grace: Could royal now face police enquiries? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2MpPNbf9Bo</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x2MpPNbf9Bo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:30:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The name Andrew Albert Christian Edward Mountbatten Windsor might sound regal, but it's missing one word - "Prince". Britain's King Charles has begun the process of removing his brother Andrew's royal titles. The former prince has also been told to vacate his royal residence. For months, pressure to act has been mounting on the King over Andrew's links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual abuse, welcomed the decision. They are now calling for an investigation into the former prince, though Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.

YouTube's AI moderation system seems to think so, as it has started pulling videos that show users how to sidestep Microsoft's setup restrictions. 

Tech YouTuber Rich White, aka CyberCPU Tech, was the first to go public about the issue on October 26, when he posted a video reporting the removal of a how-to he published on installing Windows 11 25H2 with a local account instead of a Microsoft account. In the video, White expressed concern that YouTube's automated flagging process may be the root of the problem, as he found it hard to believe that "creating a local account in Windows 11 could lead to serious harm or even death," as YouTube reportedly alleged when it removed the video. 

When he appealed, White said that YouTube denied the request within 10 to 20 minutes, early on a Sunday morning, which led him to speculate that there wasn't a human in the loop when the request was shut down. That wasn't his only video removed, either. The next day, White uploaded his video for this week on installing Windows 11 25H2 on unsupported hardware, which was removed hours after being posted. YouTube justified the removal on similar grounds. [...] At least two other YouTubers - Britec09 and Hrutkay Mods - have released videos alleging much of the same.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>29 Years Later Preview!!!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYvJ1y32oSE</link><author>Georg Rockall-Schmidt</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NYvJ1y32oSE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:28:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5h8yHSUS4n7zPnh0dG0SA">Georg Rockall-Schmidt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's ya boy, Byron Nominal Howitzer!

A  of money: $75  over the next four years. Part of that goes to another metric ICE will apparently never meet: 10,000 new hires. Not that ICE isn’t trying. It’s currently pissing off law enforcement agencies all over the country by throwing $50,000 signing bonuses at new recruits — something that has the potential to deprive local law enforcement of some of their current, um… talent. It has also lowered its standards and ripped the age limits off both ends of the scale, hoping to attract a blend of people who’ve already aged out of physical work and fresh faces their new bosses will likely assume don’t really want work.Now that it’s been a few months since the hiring surge began, we’re finally seeing some results. And it’s possibly worse than you imagine. Here’s only the tip of the iceberg, as reported by Nick Miroff for The Atlantic:President Donald Trump’s plan to double the size of the ICE workforce has met a foe more powerful than any activist group. It is decimating new recruits at the agency’s training academy in Georgia. It is the ICE personal-fitness test.More than a third have failed so far, four officials told me, impeding the agency’s plan to hire, train, and deploy 10,000 deportation officers by January. To pass, recruits must do 15 push-ups and 32 sit-ups, and run 1.5 miles in 14 minutes.“It’s pathetic,” one career ICE official told me, adding that before now, a typical class of 40 recruits had only a couple of candidates fail, because the screening process was more rigorous.“Pathetic” is being kind. Everything about the hiring process has been eased and streamlined. The physical requirements have been lowered and still can’t be met. And those handling the recruits don’t know who’s capable of passing this entry requirement until they’re already on site because the application process allows potential hires to “self-certify” that they can, in fact, do a few push ups and sit ups. Like nearly every other entity engaged in hiring, it also allows self-certification elsewhere. Applicants check a box and sign their names, swearing they don’t have a criminal record and can pass a drug test. Far too late, recruiters are realizing some of these applicants can’t do that either. And, again, they’re not finding this out until potential hires are already at the ICE academy and engaged in the training program.That means unvetted applicants are getting access to ICE training materials and wandering through areas most members of the public would be barred from entering. Not that shortening the time frame and lowering physical expectations seems to matter. Flooding the zone with recruits just means resources are being wasted. Nearly half of new recruits who’ve arrived for training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center over the past three months were later sent home because they couldn’t pass the written exam, according to the data. But “sent home” isn’t entirely accurate. As both NBC News and the Atlantic report, people who fail to become ICE officers are often routed to other parts of the agency to handle administrative work. But they’re no better trained to do this work, which means the people who can are handling an influx of people who can’t, ensuring everything behind the scenes is going just as poorly as the more visible flame-outs in ICE’s version of basic training.ICE does not have enough guns or vehicles for everyone, and the lack of experience among new hires with booking and processing procedures means they’re not especially helpful for administrative tasks. Other ICE field offices are short of parking spaces and bathroom capacity to accommodate a two- or threefold jump in staffing, a senior official told me. They’ve been told to divide up cubicles and look for additional space to lease.Honestly, I’d expect nothing less than this sort of chaos from this administration. It moves like a wrecking ball covered in chainsaws, carving a wide swath of collateral damage en route to its target — a target that it very often seems to miss. It’s hard to imagine ICE being even worse than it already is, but given these early reports, the ICE we see now might be the best version of itself. And that might be one of the most depressing sentences I’ve ever written. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Once Again, Chat Control Flails After Strong Public Pressure</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/once-again-chat-control-flails-after-strong-public-pressure</link><author>Thorin Klosowski</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/OG-Encryption-DefendEncryption.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:08:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chilling Mystery of the Silver Mask (Full Episode) | Kingdom of Mummies | National Geographic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFmtQMoDz0M</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VFmtQMoDz0M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:07:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Archaeologists in Egypt’s necropolis of Saqqara unearth the first silver burial mask found in almost a century and uncover clues to a little-known goddess.

He closed it out with a list: "Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, staking and Web3." Those weren't random buzzwords. They were part of an $84,000 betting market [non-paywalled source]. 

Across prediction market platforms Kalshi and Polymarket, users had wagered on which words would be spoken during the call -- part of a niche category known as mention markets, where the outcome isn't tied to earnings, price moves or sports games, but to what people say in some public forum. With the final analyst question complete, several terms listed in contracts were still unsaid. Armstrong ticked them off one by one. 

"I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call," he said in his parting remarks. "I just want to add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, staking, and Web3 -- to make sure we get those in before the end of the call." The exchange's CEO had just moved a market -- even if only a small one. 

Mention markets are one of the more curious byproducts of the broader prediction market boom, but also one of the more controversial. Platforms like Kalshi, which is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Polymarket, which is in the process of returning to the US market, let users wager on the outcomes of real-world events. That can mean elections, policy decisions, or sports -- but also, increasingly, corporate rituals and even common jargon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Courts Order Food Stamp Payments During Shutdown | Bloomberg Businessweek Daily 10/31/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xIzoGEwDoU</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7xIzoGEwDoU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 20:01:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On today's episode of Bloomberg Businessweek Daily, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec discuss two federal judges ruling that the Trump administration must use contingency funds to at least partially keep food-aid benefits programs operational during the government shutdown.

He expresses concern about the lack of a clear strategy and warns that this could open a Pandora's box, especially in relation to China. Hodges also questions Trump’s strong focus on Venezuela, viewing the military actions as potentially aimed at regime change rather than addressing drug cartels. He raises alarms about Trump's intention to deploy military troops into U.S. cities, suggesting it could challenge military leadership. Additionally, Hodges shares a grim outlook on the situation in Ukraine, believing that Russia feels increasingly confident that Europe and the U.S. may give up on supporting Ukraine.

The man’s work involves American health and illness, life and death, so it’s just generally not funny. And that holds true to Kennedy’s wielding of incomplete, inaccurate, and unsettled science to go before all of America and declare definitively that acetaminophen, of which Tylenol is the most famous brand, was at least partially the cause for autism spectrum disorder when expecting mothers took it for pain or fever while pregnant. It wasn’t funny when Trump went to the same microphone and did likewise, stating simply “Don’t take Tylenol” if you’re pregnant. It wasn’t funny when Sinclair decided to abuse its airwaves to disserve the public interest (hey, Brendan Carr, over here!) by spreading even more Tylenol disinformation. And it wasn’t funny when Senator Bill Cassidy took to the airwaves to complain about Kennedy’s nonsense when he was a pivotal voice and vote in confirming Captain Brainworm to head HHS in the first place.But, I have to admit, this is very funny. See, Texas AG Ken Paxton, a man who I imagine has a Donald Trump body pillow to cuddle with at night, decided to run with the claims Kennedy and Trump made and has filed a lawsuit against the makers of Tylenol for their “deceptive” marketing and labeling practices for Tylenol.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the maker of Tylenol, Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson, who previously sold Tylenol, claiming that they have been “deceptively marketing Tylenol” knowing that it “leads to a significantly increased risk of autism and other disorders.”To back that claim, Paxton relies on the “considerable body of evidence… recently highlighted by the Trump Administration.”Specifically Trump and Kennedy’s claims about Tylenol, actually. See, this is already funny. Here’s one passage from the suit itself, the entirety of which is embedded below.There are many examples of drugs regulated by the Food and Drug Administration that include complete information regarding risks on their labels even when the underlying science—unlike here—is not fully settled. These labels reflect the aims of the regulatory system, which recognizes States’ authority to require warnings to inform consumers of certain risks. Pregnant women should be provided with complete information so that they can make informed decisions regarding the risks to which they expose their unborn children.So, to start with, regulating OTC drug labels is the responsibility of the FDA. If these companies were not properly including warnings on their standardized labels, the remedy for that is getting the FDA involved, which has regulatory teeth and enforcement mechanisms to declare OTC drugs to be “misbranded.” Tylenol has been around for decades. The idea that this hasn’t been an issue for the better part of a century, but now is, is plainly absurd.But I want to pay very close attention to Paxton’s claim that warning labels include risks even when the science isn’t settled, but that this isn’t one of those cases. In this case, according to Paxton, the science settled, making this all the worse.But that’s all kinds of bullshit. The science here isn’t remotely settled. The scientists of those very studies cited by Paxton have complained about how the administration is drawing conclusions from studies that they are very upfront about being inconclusive. None of Kennedy’s data was “new.” It was merely new analysis of old studies.“The causative association between Tylenol given in pregnancy and the perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism,” Kennedy told reporters. “But it’s very suggestive.”“There should be a cautious approach to it,” he added. “ That’s why our message to patients, to mothers, to people who are pregnant and to the mothers of young children is: Consult your physician.”That’s . And that is very funny. Paxton just got pantsed by the very person he cited in his lawsuit, in which he claimed this was all settled science. Even Kennedy, a man capable of saying outrageous things when it comes to healthcare and science, walked this back. And, in doing so, he tore an enormous hole in the lawsuit that Paxton, a Trump bootlicking sycophant, . Drink that shit in, because it’s delicious.Now, even Kennedy’s walkback is still bad, of course. He’s acting like this is all more sinister and direct of a relationship than there actually is between autism and Tylenol. “It’s very suggestive” is a line without meaning, scientifically. Suggestive to whom? And to what degree? It’s typical Kennedy, taking outlier studies and pretending they mean much more than they do, even as researchers complain about the methodology of those studies, or their inconclusive nature. He did this with his claim that America’s men are suffering greatly from reduced sperm counts, and now he’s doing it here.But in a country that could use a good laugh at the moment, I’m not going to pretend like what he did to Paxton isn’t funny.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to build silos and decrease collaboration on purpose</title><link>https://www.rubick.com/how-to-build-silos-and-decrease-collaboration/</link><author>gpi</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 19:16:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“We need to break down silos between departments and get people to collaborate better” — almost every leader everywhere.Most leaders reflexively think of silos as BAD and collaboration as GOOD. This manifesto defends silos and challenges the value of collaboration.Increasing collaboration can do harmIn general, you should aim to maximize collaboration  teams, and minimize collaboration  teams.Why maximize collaboration within teams?A collaborative team works together on one or two goals. Why?This maximizes shared state — everyone has a common understanding of goals, progress, and who is doing what.This gives team members a better ability to focus and coordinate their work with each other.Team members have overlapping areas of knowledge, so they can critique each other’s work and help each other grow.They are more innovative, because the interplay between people as they work on the same goal helps generate more diverse thinking and improve decision-making.When someone leaves the team, the fact that others have a shared understanding of the work means the team can survive and continue to work effectively.People can go on vacation or leave without as much disruption.Collaborative teams feel great to be a part of — everyone shares the same victories and accomplishments together. A team that doesn’t collaborate often really isn’t a team at all.Why minimize collaboration between teams?To the maximum extent possible, teams should have what they need to succeed within the borders of their team. And where that is not true, you need some structure to ensure the team can get what it needs in a way that will scale with the organization’s growth.As companies grow, communication and dependencies proliferate. Companies start out with many-to-many communication. As they grow, the communication patterns within the company must necessarily switch to being segmented and defined. Otherwise, the communication burden on teams will grow at an exponential rate, and the increasing complexity will degrade the effectiveness of the company.I observed an example of this at New Relic:As the engineering organization grew, we encouraged a collaborative culture and rewarded people for collaboration between teams (it was even part of our promotion criteria — you can blame that on me!).After a few years, the increasing number of teams made it more and more difficult to manage dependencies between teams, to the point that it eventually became impossible to accomplish any large project within the organization. I know, because I was one of the “best project managers”, so I got put on many of those large projects — and they were systematically impossible to execute on. We all tried heroically to make it work, but the system was rigged — there wasn’t a way to accomplish these larger projects.The solution to this was to eventually define the interaction models between teams, reduce dependencies, and add some structure to prioritization and communication.Looking back in retrospect, it was as obvious as math what happened, but I see organizations fall into this trap over and over. We’ll talk more about how to structure these solutions in the second blog post in this series.Collaboration  great, but it’s something you want to actively be combating between teams. A little collaboration is fine, but excessive collaboration between teams is a sign your organization isn’t structured well. If you ever wonder why Bezos took such a hard line on his API mandate in 2002, this probably factored into it. Bezos structured Amazon so that teams were as independent as possible.Silos are boundaries between groups of people, based on the organizational structure and teams they’re working on.Silos exist because humans have cognitive and communication limits:Humans can only handle a certain number of relationshipsHumans have a limit to how much communication they can handle.Humans are pre-wired to think in terms of teams and tribes. We work better in small groups.Humans have cognitive limits on the amount they can focus on.It’s important to recognize that these limits are real limits, and not something you can wish away. Every company in the world (above a certain size) operates in teams that specialize. We organize into teams and have org structures generally because that is what human beings need to work in larger groups.There are ways to flex certain aspects of this. For example, a company that is designed to be fully asynchronous can rely on process and tooling to change some of these constraints. But even then, you’re moving the constraints around, not eliminating them completely. You need to operate in a way that recognizes these limits.Why do leaders want to break down silos?Leaders start talking about breaking down silos when they see that individual parts of the company aren’t achieving larger business outcomes and are excessively focused on their own area. Alternatively, they talk about breaking down silos when parts of the company aren’t well coordinated with each other. Generally this happens once the organization has become complex enough that the structure is getting in the way.Here are a couple of examples:Marketing is planning a major announcement of an upcoming launch, but can’t get a timing commitment from the product and engineering teams.Two teams in engineering are building the same service, but in slightly different ways.Leaders see these things, and start blathering about “breaking down silos” and “increasing collaboration”. What’s wrong with that?“Breaking down silos” represents incomplete thinking“Breaking down silos” is an exhortation rather than a diagnosis or prescription of how to improve the situation. “Breaking down silos” blames individuals for not having a big enough vision and working across boundaries, instead of looking with curiosity at the system and asking  they are doing what they’re doing. It’s expecting people to have your level of perspective without figuring out why they don’t.But the main problem is that it isn’t specific enough.Communication != Collaboration != CoordinationWhen you hear someone say they want teams to collaborate more or break down silos, encourage them to look at the problem from three perspectives:Usually when people talk about collaboration, what they’re really looking for is better coordination.Coordination is “the harmonious functioning of parts for effective results” (Merriam-Webster)The US military found that the best way to coordinate groups of people quickly and effectively was to centralize coordination and decentralize decision-making and execution. This is still the state of the art for organizational design. You want local groups to be able to act independently and have what they need to be successful. You want centralized functions to set high level objectives and coordinate where necessary to produce the right outcomes.We’ll talk in the second post in this series about a multitude of ways you can coordinate groups of people working together.Communication is transferring information from one person or group to another.When people talk about needing increased collaboration, you can often achieve this more effectively by looking at the flow of information between people, and redesigning it. Typically, you can do something like this:Ask people how they are getting information today.Find out what information people actually need.Design the lightest weight version of this you can imagine.Get feedback and act on that feedback.One thing I’ve done over and over in many startups is set up weekly communication on projects in engineering. This helps the marketing organization understand how to coordinate their work with engineering, among other benefits.Collaboration is when people work together to produce an outcome. When teams are collaborating, it means they’re working with other teams to achieve outcomes together. That’s often a sign the team isn’t set up well. Ideally, it should have what it needs to do what it needs without dependencies on other teams.A team that has to collaborate to achieve its objectives is going to be less reliably successful. In general, teams shouldn’t be collaborating with more than a couple of teams, unless they’re explicitly set up to be that way. For example, in some organizations you might set up the design team as a “service” organization which provides design for a larger organization. For teams that are set up that way, it can be fine, but it usually should be very carefully thought through. What is the interaction model for the team, and how will it deal with the inevitable fact that there will be excess demands on it? We’ll cover some of these patterns and their tradeoffs in the second post in this series.Of course, the world is messy, and you shouldn’t expect a complete lack of collaboration between teams. But when you see teams collaborate, that’s something to pay attention to.You might think of silos as “encapsulation”. Leaders want to dig into the internals of the classes holding the logic they need. But it’s a bad solution to just bolt that on — you really need to refactor things so that they are better structured.How do you get teams to coordinate better?I always appreciate hearing your thoughts and reactions to my posts.Thank you to the many people who helped improve this post. Rebecca Campbell always makes my work better. She helped me tighten up many of my arguments and helped me realize that I needed to make the section on coordination more explicit. Brent Miller, always the purveyer of astute observations, offered structural feedback that made the post much stronger. Chris Haupt, always thoughtful, pointed out a few areas that he didn’t find convincing, and helped me see that I needed to go deeper on information flow. Aaron Erickson suggested the metaphor of encapsulation. Thanks to Neville Kuyt for suggesting I define silo. And additional thank you to Robert DiFalco and Darin Swanson for reviewing and commenting on the post. Always appreciate your insight!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deal to allow UK access to major EU defence scheme could be reached in mid-November</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rS3fxYQ6pQ</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5rS3fxYQ6pQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 19:08:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deal to allow UK access to major EU defence scheme could be reached in mid-November

The former Marine has 7 million followers and nearly 10 million people watched him open a Proven Industries trailer hitch lock in April using a shim cut from an aluminum can. The Florida company responded by filing a federal lawsuit in May charging McNally with eight offenses. Judge Mary Scriven denied the preliminary injunction request in June and found the video was fair use. 

McNally's followers then flooded the company with harassment. Proven dismissed the case in July and asked the court to seal the records. The company had initiated litigation over a video that all parties acknowledged was accurate. ArsTechnica adds: Judging from the number of times the lawsuit talks about 1) ridicule and 2) harassment, it seems like the case quickly became a personal one for Proven's owner and employees, who felt either mocked or threatened. That's understandable, but being mocked is not illegal and should never have led to a lawsuit or a copyright claim. As for online harassment, it remains a serious and unresolved issue, but launching a personal vendetta -- and on pretty flimsy legal grounds -- against McNally himself was patently unwise. (Doubly so given that McNally had a huge following and had already responded to DMCA takedowns by creating further videos on the subject; this wasn't someone who would simply be intimidated by a lawsuit.) 

In the end, Proven's lawsuit likely cost the company serious time and cash -- and generated little but bad publicity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Denies Venezuela Strike Plans | Balance of Power 10/31/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8r5pZC5UAI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k8r5pZC5UAI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 18:37:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On the early edition of Balance of Power, Bloomberg Washington Correspondent Joe Mathieu discusses the latest news from the nation's capital.

There's an industry that consumes even more power than many tech giants, and it has largely escaped the same scrutiny: suppliers of industrial gases. 

Everyday items like toothpaste and life-saving treatments like MRIs are among the countless parts of modern life that hinge on access to gases such as nitrogen, oxygen and helium. Producing and transporting these gases to industrial facilities and hospitals is a highly energy-intensive process. Three companies -- Linde, Air Liquide and Air Products and Chemicals -- control 70% of the $120 billion global market for industrial gases. Their initiatives to rein in electricity use or switch to renewables aren't enough to rapidly cut carbon emissions, according to a new report from the campaign group Action Speaks Louder. 

"The scale of the sector's greenhouse gas emissions and electricity use is staggering," said George Harding-Rolls, the group's head of campaigns and one of the authors of the report. Linde's electricity use in 2024 exceeded that of Alphabet's Google and Samsung Electronics as well as oil giant TotalEnergies, while the power use of Air Liquide and Air Products was comparable to that of Shell and Microsoft. Yet unlike fossil fuel and tech companies, these industrial gas companies are far from household names because their customers are the world's largest chemicals, steel and oil companies rather than average consumers. 

The industry relies on air-separation units, which use giant compressors to turn air into liquid and then distill it into its many components. These machines are responsible for much of the industry's electricity demand, and their use alone is responsible for 2% of carbon dioxide emissions in China and the US, the world's two largest polluters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Xi Jinping - His Rise &amp; Rule</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcZ3LsaTHCU</link><author>The People Profiles</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZcZ3LsaTHCU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:56:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6TPU-PvTMvqgzC_AM7_uA">The People Profiles</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dive deep into the definitive biography of Xi Jinping, the Paramount Leader of China and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since 2012. This comprehensive biography explores one man's incredible journey through the hardship of the Cultural Revolution, to become one of the most powerful people in the world as the Supreme Leader of China.

From his early life in Liangjiahe to his political rise through the provinces (Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai), we trace the key moments that shaped his governance. Learn about the seismic shifts defining the Xi Jinping era: the massive Anti-Corruption Campaign ("Tigers and Flies"), the abolition of term limits (2018), and the codification of Xi Jinping Thought in the constitution.

Globally, Xi Jinping is known as the architect of the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a new Silk Road connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa. Domestically, his focus has been on Common Prosperity, tightening regulations on the Chinese tech sector (Alibaba, Tencent), and major military reforms of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).

They always do. And part of that is just because kids need those kinds of “third spaces” where they can communicate outside the prying eyes of parents or teachers. And if adults keep blocking off those spaces, kids are smart enough to figure out clever workarounds.Six years ago, when schools blocked social media apps on their networks, students simply repurposed Google Docs—required for assignments—into an improvised social network which they could hide from teachers and parents by claiming they were working on homework:Teens told me they use Google Docs to chat just about any time they need to put their phone away but know their friends will be on computers. Sometimes they’ll use the service’s live-chat function, which doesn’t open by default, and which many teachers don’t even know exists. Or they’ll take advantage of the fact that Google allows users to highlight certain phrases or words, then comment on them via a pop-up box on the right side: They’ll clone a teacher’s shared Google document, then chat in the comments, so it appears to the casual viewer that they’re just making notes on the lesson plan. If a teacher approaches to take a closer look, they can click the Resolve button, and the entire thread will disappear.That was 2019. I’m sure things like that are still happening in Google Docs, but it’s apparently also happening in an even more absurd venue: podcast comments.The latest “How To Do Everything” podcast from NPR featured someone who monitors comments for the TED Radio Hour. She noticed something strange: kids are flooding the comments of random old episodes, turning obscure three-year-old podcasts into makeshift chat rooms where adults won’t think to look.Yeah, so one of my responsibilities on my team is to monitor our Spotify comments. And for the most part, we mostly get really like nice comments or people engaging with our content, giving constructive feedback or saying how much they liked it. But about 3 weeks ago, I noticed kind of a different floodgate situation. And the first instance was only about 20 comments….20 comments on one episode that came out three years ago. Yeah. And all the comments kind of had the same like, “No, you’re so pretty. You’re so pretty.” And I was really trying to rack my brain about the content of this episode 3 years ago to be like, is there a discussion about beauty standards that they are trying to engage with?Yeah. And then about a week later, they struck again, but this time hitting the comments hit into the 90s.And then I kind of felt like, okay, this really needs to be something we’re flagging. And when I brought it up, it seemed like other teams had also been privately sitting on this very odd situation.So the show’s hosts discuss this, and the sense is that they’re using these shows as a space to communicate:GUEST: Yeah, I mean, we definitely can’t say exactly who these people are, why they’re doing this, but my sense is that they’re kids. One of the theories that some other folks have put forward is that maybe this is just a way to get around a classroom phone free situation. Like maybe they can have their laptops out but they can’t have Instagram open or Spotify is the only thing they’re allowed to have. I don’t actually know. It seems like a workaround for sure.HOST: It’s brilliant because like what could be less worrying to a teacher or a parent might be catching, you know, a look at one of these kids’ phones that they’re listening to NPR’s TED Radio Hour with their friends.They ask for an example episode, and indeed, there’s an episode on “What Leadership Looks Like” from 2022 (there’s another one with the same title that might just be a rerun from 2024 which doesn’t have comments) and you can see comments from a few weeks ago that are clearly kids chatting.So, it seems likely that the theory is at least close to correct, that kids are just seeking out places where they can speak freely that  okay to adults at the very same time adults are trying to ban the other spaces where parents think they’ll talk and don’t like it.As the person from TED Radio Hour (unfortunately, her name is not clearly stated and I couldn’t figure out what it was…) notes:I think my sense from digging into it a little bit and following the usernames was effectively they make a playlist that has just one podcast and that podcast becomes kind of the graffiti space I guess of this… popup conversation.To me, this demonstrates some of the futility of trying to ban these spaces. As I mentioned above, kids  these kinds of “third spaces” that are not school and not home in which to communicate more freely with their friends. Because of a variety of moral panics, we’ve closed off many of the real world physical spaces where that could occur, so it was no surprise that many kids gravitated to digital spaces.But now that adults are, again, seeking to close off those spaces, kids appear to be coming up with clever ways to sneak around those bans and keep talking.Of course, the moral panic could always follow them here too. Maybe Australia will ban kids from Spotify comments next. Then Google Docs. Then whatever random corner of the internet kids discover after that. We can keep playing whac-a-mole until we’ve legislated away every possible space where teenagers might talk to each other without adult supervision. At least it’ll feel like we’re doing something.Or—and here’s a thought—we could stop trying to eliminate every space where kids communicate and start teaching them how to navigate those spaces safely. We could recognize that kids need room to talk, to mess up, to figure things out away from constant surveillance. That would require trusting kids to learn, rather than treating every unsupervised conversation as a crisis waiting to happen. But judging by the current trajectory, we’re more likely to see legislation banning carrier pigeons first.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The Ultimate Unity Game Development Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/31/daily-deal-the-ultimate-unity-game-development-bundle-2/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:46:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ultimate Unity Game Development Bundle has 4 courses are designed to designed to teach about game dev and how to create your own games using the Unity engine.

Once there, the applied holography quickly joined the quest into the properties of this phase that had long evaded a consistent and satisfactory explanation.\
Instead of going after the NFL fermion propagator, however, many of the holographic proposals focused on reproducing the experimental data in the cuprates - and often times even claimed achieving a quantitative agreement.\
In light of its intrinsically unsettled status one would have thought that it might be rather detrimental for any speculative approach to seek out not a mere qualitative but an actual quantitative, down to the number, agreement between its specific predictions and some preselected sets of experimental data. In fact, if such a quantitative agreement were indeed achieved one would have even more explaining to do (first and foremost, as to why an apriori approximate approach appears to be so unexpectedly accurate?).\
The earlier discussion of some of the popular evidence in support of condensed matter holography as well as the debunking of a number of its specific predictions [26] can be found in [34]. However, the admirable persistence with which those predictions continued to be regularly cited in the subsequent holographic literature [35] suggests that the comments of [34] might have had been (most regretfully) overlooked.\
In fact, there is more than a single reason for which semiclassical holography (or its improvement at the level of accounting for the matter back-reaction in the HartreeFock approximation) - thus far, the only practical way of performing the holographic calculations [26–29] - would not have been expected to provide any quantitatively accurate results in the first place. There are, of course, such obvious differences from the string-theoretical holographic constructions as a low physical value of N (which, in practice, often amounts to ’spin up/down’) and the lack of Lorentz, translational, and/or rotational (as well as any super-)symmetries.\
Arguably, though, the most important is the fact that much of the condensed matter physics operates in the intermediate - as opposed to ultra-strong - interaction regime, while it is only the latter that is supposed to have a weakly coupled gravity as its bulk dual [26]. Indeed, most solids form under the condition that its potential (interaction) and kinetic energies on average balance each other out. This suggests that the ’bona fide’ strong-coupling regime could only become attainable in some sort of a ’flat band’ scenario where kinetic energy is completely quenched or, at least, significantly diminished.\
In light of that, it is unsurprising that much of the recent effort towards implementing such mechanism has been centered on the SYK model and its variants [31] whose ’flat band’ nature facilitates the existence of a holographic dual. A viable candidate to this role was proposed in the form of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) dilatonenhanced 1 + 1-dimensional gravity [31].\
It is worth pointing out, though, that at the practical level all the holographic matching between the SYK and JT theories has been, so far, established within their low-energy sectors that are both controlled by a single soft Schwarzian mode (’boundary graviton’). So as far as the low-energy properties of the two models are concerned, they both allow for the same (effectively 0 + 1- dimensional) description in terms of either a fluctuating 1d boundary or Liouvillian-type large-N matrix quantum mechanics [31, 36]. This is not surprising given the intrinsically non-dynamical nature of 2d (and 3d) pure gravity. Such a caveat notwithstanding, the low-energy SYK-JT equivalence has been repeatedly and staunchly referred to as a genuine example of holographic correspondence between the 1+1-dimensional bulk and 0+1-dimensional boundary theories [31].\
As to the general HV models (22) and corresponding vacuum metrics (26), the standard list of observables to be matched includes temperature-dependent specific heat\
and frequency-dependent optical conductivity\
determined by the bare scaling dimensions.\
Incidentally, this value of the HV parameter was previously singled out on the basis of analyzing entanglement entropy [28]. Besides, it suggests the interpretation of d − θ as an effective number of dimensions orthogonal to the FS.\
The other frequently invoked relation [26, 28, 29] is\
in which case the first inequality in (27) is marginally satisfied as equality. Notably, in 2d it would only be consistent with (40) for z = 3/2.\
Also, from the beginning of the cuprates saga an even greater fixation has always been on the linear-T dependence of resistivity, also observed in a variety of other materials [35]. Of course, the conductivity scaling with frequency (39) does not readily translate into its temperature dependence, as it would be determined by a specific mechanism of momentum relaxation (i.e., Umklapp, phonons, and/or disorder).\
To this end, the use of the memory matrix technique yielded a proper conductivity scaling [26, 35] in both limits of strong,\
momentum-non-conserving scattering where ∆ is the dimension of the leading translation invariance-breaking 8 operator. The formulas (42) and (43) agree for ∆ = z + (d − θ)/2 which condition coincides with that of marginal fulfillment of the Harris criterion for the disorder scattering to become a relevant perturbation.\
An alternate interpretation of the linear-T resistivity, σ(T ) ∼ 1/T , proposed in [26, 35] relates it to the FL-like entropy, S(T ) ∼ C(T ) ∼ T . This school of thought introduces the notion of inelastic ’Planckian’ scattering rate as a potentially single most important scale for thermalization/equilibration/information scrambling (albeit not a rate of momentum relaxation) in strongly interacting systems\
Interestingly, it is the (admittedly, unphysical) model of [38] that so far has managed to reproduce a longer list of the power-law dependencies found in the cuprates, as compared to the competing schemes [39]. Unfortunately, such a serendipitous success does not offer any immediate insight into the underlying mechanism of the NFL behavior in the cuprates.\
Furthermore, contrasting the large-r and -τ asymptotics (31) of the HV holographic propagators against their eikonal/bosonization counterparts in search of some agreement suggests finite positive values of θ, contrary to the ’Planckian’ scenario. This observation might further reduce the chances of constructing a consistent HV holographic model of the strange metal phase in the cuprates.\
In part, the deficiencies of the HV-based approach have been circumvented by the arrival of the ’second SYK wave’ [40] which utilizes the Hamiltonian obtained from the conventional combination of a kinetic (quadratic) and interaction (quartic) terms by randomizing the amplitudes of either one or both of these terms a la SY K. Making such randomization spatially non-uniform one opens a channel for non-conservation of momentum which then gives rise to the linear-T ’Planckian’ rate (on top of a constant).\
Of course, the very existence of different explanations (cf., for example, [35, 39] and [40]) for certain scaling laws observed in the cuprates may suggest that their ultimate interpretation is yet to be found. It would be, therefore, imperative to strive to extend the list of matching properties, akin to [38, 39] as the means of discriminating between the competing schemes.(1) D. V.

Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.Why We Explored a New ApproachWhen LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the Data.gov Archive, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit a transition moment. At that time, we elected to switch case.law to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server RequiredRecent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like DuckDB-Wasm, sql.js-httpvfs, and Protomaps, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works: We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting. Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser. When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like hyparquet and Arquero to further improve performance.Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and BeyondThis new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes: By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.Reduced technical overhead: With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern. Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world: If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting. Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us.

This week, we discuss keeping FOIA reporting in front of a paywall, Ray-Bans, and what pregnate Schoolhouse Rock bills say about our current AI-driven hellscape.Yesterday I did a livestreamed event with Freedom of the Press Foundation and WIRED. It was called Unpaywalled: The case for making public records-based reporting free and you can . As you might know, we made a decision very early on with 404 Media, I think in the first week maybe, to not paywall our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reporting. There are a few reasons, but the main one simply is that with public records, we think people should be able to see those records without paying. It’s like a government agency publishing certain databases, or census data, or whatever. These are public records and should be published or re-published as such.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tattd gave four TechCrunch writers tattoos at Startup Battlefield</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/tattd-gave-four-techcrunch-writers-tattoos-at-startup-battlefield/</link><author>Amanda Silberling</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:32:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tattd, a marketplace for tattoo-seekers and artists, set up a mini tattoo parlor in the Expo Hall at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers threaten to leak data after breaching University of Pennsylvania to send mass emails</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/hackers-threaten-to-leak-data-after-breaching-university-of-pennsylvania-to-send-mass-emails/</link><author>Amanda Silberling</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:30:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the hackers plainly stated in their message ("Please stop giving us money"), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Displacement, assassinations and cocaine: Colombia’s endless war</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/displacement-assassinations-and-cocaine-colombias-endless-war</link><author>Guillermo Galdos</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deep in the rainforests of Colombia, a war is raging between the government and rebel groups.Fueled by the huge demand for cocaine worldwide, the war has continued for 60 years. I gained rare access to a rebel group and investigated the effect the war has had on locals.I’ve been travelling to Colombia for nearly 30 years, documenting its long and painful conflicts. Over that time, I’ve interviewed almost every armed group that has shaped the country’s modern history.But filming this latest Unreported World episode in the Catatumbo region in northern Colombia, felt particularly raw.A region at war for decadesCatatumbo, a lush, mountainous area bordering Venezuela, has been at war for decades. It’s a strategic corridor for cocaine trafficking, a route connecting coca fields in the Andean foothills to smuggling networks across the border.Filming this latest Unreported World episode in the Catatumbo region in northern Colombia, felt particularly raw.The ELN, one of Latin America’s oldest insurgent groups, was founded in 1964 and is designated as a terrorist organisation by Washington.For 60 years, the Colombian government has battled the group, which has been accused of extortion, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and attacks that have killed thousands of civilians.The ELN insists it is fighting for social justice, but its methods and its alleged deep involvement in the cocaine trade have left a trail of suffering, especially among the civilians caught in the middle.‘Tense, surreal and deeply revealing’Our team headed to a remote mountain camp, where we managed to interview ELN commander Silvana Guerrero, who denied any involvement in cocaine production or forcibly recruiting teenagers.It was tense, surreal, and deeply revealing.These young men and women live by strict rules, isolated from their families, convinced they are fighting for a cause worth dying for.But what struck me most wasn’t the ideology or the weapons – it was the people living between the frontlines.Giving hope to bereaved mothersWe met Carmen, a woman whose life embodies Colombia’s tragedy. She lost her husband to the army and her son to the ELN.Out of that pain, she built something extraordinary: Madres del Catatumbo – Mothers of Catatumbo – an organisation that helps women who have lost children to the conflict, regardless of which side they fought for.Her story reminded me that behind every uniform and every rifle, there’s a mother waiting, mourning, or fearing the worst. It doesn’t matter which side her child fights for – the grief is the same.Carmen brings them together, helping them transform grief into action and carry a message of peace in a place that has forgotten what peace feels like.Her story reminded me that behind every uniform and every rifle, there’s a mother waiting, mourning, or fearing the worst. It doesn’t matter which side her child fights for – the grief is the same.‘Relying’ on coca for survivalIn Catatumbo, we also met coca farmers who, for decades, have relied on the plant simply to survive.Coca grows three times a year, offering a modest but steady income in a region with no roads, schools or markets.Despite billions spent on the so-called war on drugs, little has changed.The price of cocaine remains almost the same, while the drug trafficking networks continue to profit from it, using the money to fund the war.The 2016 peace deal raised hopes that Colombia might finally turn a page. But as long as cocaine fuels the conflict, peace will remain elusive.These young men and women live by strict rules, isolated from their families, convinced they are fighting for a cause worth dying for.The poor farmers of Catatumbo will keep planting, the armed groups and criminal organisations will keep fighting over territory and trafficking routes, and families like Carmen’s will keep burying their dead.After thirty years of covering this country, I still find hope in its people – their resilience, their courage, and their refusal to give up on peace.Unreported World: Special Substack seriesEach newsletter article – written by our award-winning journalists – will examine and reflect on the extraordinary episodes bringing unique insight.Read and watch more here:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bloomberg Surveillance 10/31/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PH2Sp3RDRA</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3PH2Sp3RDRA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:29:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowicz and Annmarie Hordern speak daily with leaders and decision makers from Wall Street to Washington and beyond.

From a report: Vinay Prasad, who oversees gene therapies at the Food and Drug Administration, said scientific advances, like Crispr, have forced the agency to relax some of its strict rules. As an example, he cited the case of 10-month-old KJ Muldoon, who this year became the first person in history to have his genes custom edited to cure an inherited disease. 

"Regulation has to evolve as fast as science evolves," Prasad said in an interview with Bloomberg News. The agency is "going to be extremely flexible and work very fast with the scientists who want to bring these therapies to kids who need it." Prasad plans to publish a paper in early November outlining the FDA's new approach. He predicted it will spark interest in developing treatments for conditions that may affect only a handful of people.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bull Market Got Fresh AI Fuel | Bloomberg Open Interest 10/31/25</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3ZyY17V-g</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZM3ZyY17V-g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:16:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get a jump start on the US trading day with Matt Miller and Dani Burger on "Bloomberg Open Interest."

You might have heard of TRAPPIST-1. Discovered in 2017, this system of rocky planets orbiting a red dwarf star has been hailed as the most promising place to search for life outside our solar system. 

And now, one of these planets has just got even more exciting. New observations from the James Webb Telescope reveal the most compelling evidence yet: planet TRAPPIST-1e might have an Earth-like atmosphere. Join us to see what JWST found and why this could be huge.

Donald Trump and Xi Jinping were all smiles at the APEC summit. But with India still facing the highest US tariffs, Modi avoided a chance to meet Trump at the ASEAN talks. On another front, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have literally joined forces — creating a mutual defense pact that some say could lead to an “Islamic NATO.” DW’s security podcast, Global Eyes, takes a look at these questions with India’s former foreign secretary, Kanwal Sibal — and also discusses Delhi’s moves to court the Taliban — including a visit from the Afghan Taliban’s foreign minister to India and news India is re-opening its Kabul embassy. The visit came just as Pakistan and Afghanistan clashed over support to the Pakistan Taliban (the TTP). Our hosts also get input on this from former Pakistan senator, Afrasiab Khattak, who says Pakistan has been “lying to itself” about the TTP for decades. Let us know what you think about our new format in the comments.

Let’s dig in.Among the React crowd, and also among people who seem to enjoy HTMX, I see a lot this…
	Open Modal
This element does not announce itself as an interactive element to screen reader users.You can’t focus on a  with a keyboard.The event only fires on , not when the  or  keys are pressed (again, keyboard users).I’ve had arguments with a very prominent React thought leader whose name starts with R who insisted that using a  was “more accessible” than using a , and that Twitter made the right decision in using this pattern in their app.It’s wrong. It’s all wrong.Many HTML elements have  that tell assistive tech like screen readers what they do.The  element is one of them. It has an implicit  of , which tells screen reader users it can be interacted with and will trigger some type of behavior in the app.The HTML  attribute can be used to add or modify the role of an element. And so, folks like React Ry–thought-leader-guy will say stuff like (I’m paraphrasing)…That attribute exists for a reason. You can add  to a  to give it the correct semantics.OK, that addresses one issue.That role doesn’t affect focusability (or lack thereof) or keyboard behavior. Visually impaired users and people who navigate with a keyboard still can’t use it.“No worries!” they say. “We can fix that, too!”You can make the element focusable with the  attribute.
	Open Modal
You , though! Seriously, just don’t fuck with focus order.It’s way too easy to go down this path and then fuck it up and have folks jumping all over the page instead of navigating through in the normal and expected order.And again, still no keyboard interactivity.But don’t fear! You can add that, too. You just need to listen for all  events, and then filter them out by  so that you only run your code if the  or  keys were pressed (the latter means checking for a literal space: ).That can’t run on the element, either. You’ve got to attach that even to the  and figure out which element has focus.So um… ok, I guess it is technically a fix, but…You’ve just recreated all of the functionality a  gives you for freeSeriously, WTF would you do that?!?All of these hoops to write this HTML…
	Open Modal
When you could write this HTML instead…
	Open Modal
Has the correct  implicitly.Is automatically focusable.Fires a  event in response to  and  presses when it has focus.Look, I’m a lazy developer.And I suspect, if you’re someone who loves tools like React, you probably are, too. It’s cool, I get it! The best code is the code you didn’t write and all that.Use the correct element for the job, and avoid writing a bunch of extra code!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AWS exceeds Wall Street’s expectations as demand for cloud infra remains high</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/aws-exceeds-wall-streets-expectations-as-demand-for-cloud-infra-remains-high/</link><author>Rebecca Szkutak</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:59:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AWS continues to see strong demand as companies gobble up its cloud infrastructure services in the age of AI. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Futurelock: A subtle risk in async Rust</title><link>https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0609</link><author>bcantrill</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:49:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bounded channels are not really the issue here.  Even in omicron#9259, the capacity=1 channel was basically behaving as documented and as one would expect.  It woke up a sender when capacity was available, and the other senders were blocked to maintain the documented FIFO property.  However, some of the patterns that we use with bounded channels are problematic on their own and, if changed, could prevent the channel from getting caught up in a futurelock.In Omicron, we commonly use bounded channels with .  The bound is intended to cap memory usage and provide backpressure, but using the blocking  creates a second  queue: the wait queue for the channel.  Instead, we could consider using a larger capacity channel plus  and propagate failure from .As an example, when we use the actor pattern, we typically observe that there’s only one actor and potentially many clients, so there’s not much point in buffering messages  the channel.  So we use  and let clients block in .  But we could instead have  and have clients use  and propagate failure if they’re unable to send the message.  The value  here is pretty arbitrary.  You want it to be large enough to account for an expected amount of client concurrency, but not larger.  If the value is too small, you’ll wind up with spurious failures when the client could have just waited a bit longer.  If the value is too large, you can wind up queueing so much work that the actor is always behind (and clients are potentially even timing out at a higher level).  One might observe:Channel limits, channel limits: always wrong!Some too short and some too long!But as with timeouts, it’s often possible to find values that work in practice.Using  is  a mitigation because this still results in the sender blocking.  It needs to be polled after the timeout expires in order to give up.  But with futurelock, it will never be polled.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Government hackers breached telecom giant Ribbon for months before getting caught</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/government-hackers-breached-telecom-giant-ribbon-for-months-before-getting-caught/</link><author>Zack Whittaker</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:45:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ribbon, which provides software and technology to phone and internet giants, said nation-state hackers were in its systems since at least December 2024.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Working on Bare-Bones Maps That Removes Almost All Interface Elements and Labels</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/1527233/google-working-on-bare-bones-maps-that-removes-almost-all-interface-elements-and-labels?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:41:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Maps is testing a power saving mode in its latest Android beta release that strips the navigation interface to its bare essentials.

They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers. European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European." What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance. Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the OpenInfra Foundation recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration."  While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and Teams before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well. For example, in Austria, the Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems. The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Israel Is Making a Palestinian State Impossible</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2bCKakP7c</link><author>RealLifeLore</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/A-2bCKakP7c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:38:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5tjEmvPItGyLhmjdwP7Ww">RealLifeLore</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get Nebula using my link for 40% off an annual subscription: https://go.nebula.tv/reallifelore

On Sunday, it finally took the city from its former allies, putting the paramilitary group in control of almost all the Darfur region.Since then, video evidence of summary executions of civilians in Sudan has drawn widespread condemnation. The head of the World Health Organization said he was “appalled and deeply shocked” by the reported killing of 460 people in the Saudi Hospital on Tuesday.Dr Alaaeldin Nugud, spokesperson for the Leadership Council of the Sudan Founding Alliance (TASIS), which is led by RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, denied there was any evidence of this, telling Matt Frei, “This is not true. There is no video evidence for RSF killing 460 [people].”He went on to say, “They said that this video is in the Saudi hospital. But one of the people… he said that we are in a finance ministry or in a finance place. So it’s not a hospital.”“This is not true. There is no video evidence for RSF killing 460 [people].”Dr Nugud alleged that such claims are part of a media campaign against the RSF, but also TASIS, which was set up as an alternative government to the military-led authorities in the capital Khartoum.“Many of the SAF [Sudanese Armed Forces] soldiers were wearing the RSF uniforms and contemplating atrocities in many places of Sudan during this war,” he told Channel 4 News.But he added, “There are some individual atrocities and they are getting accountable,“ offering as an example a man called Abu Lulu, widely thought to be an RSF fighter, who he said had just been arrested.Channel 4 News has seen video which shows Abu Lulu executing unarmed civilians who are sitting on the ground. Images on social media also show Abu Lulu wearing RSF uniform. But Dr Nugud denied Abu Lulu was a member of the RSF saying, “Abu Lulu has a video of himself saying that he is not belonging to the RSF. So he’s not an RSF soldier.”“There are some individual atrocities and they are getting accountable.“He also rejected suggestions that the RSF is trying to split Sudan in two, claiming, “The TASIS peace government is the only guarantee for the unity of Sudan.” And he denied they are backed by the United Arab Emirates.“This is a very big lie, also. This is very big propaganda in this war that is made by the SAF and the Muslim Brotherhood, the NCP [National Congress Party]. We are not backed by anyone. We are only depending on ourselves.”Read and watch more here:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NEW MERCHANDISE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YPpMNzdH19o</link><author>Great Art Explained</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YPpMNzdH19o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:30:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePDFpCr78_qmVtpoB1Axaw">Great Art Explained</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shop here - https://greatartexplained.dashery.com

And it doesn’t care. The MAGA faithful don’t care that they’re being lied to pretty much all the time. All they care about is how much the messaging aligns with their bigotry and hatred. Everyone else who spots the lies can feel free to point them out, but this administration is living its best life in the post-truth era it has crafted for itself.The DHS and its underling agencies are fully engaged in lying pretty much all of the time. This concerted effort to avoid the truth has even given Trump  pause. Sure, it was only a momentary lapse into reason, but earlier this year (right before returning to his plans to invade Portland, Oregon) Trump briefly wondered if he was being misled by the liars he chose to employ. For an extremely tiny amount of time, Trump thought  might be the sucker at the table.That momentary flash of introspection has yet to return. Constant lying is the name of the game. The administration can’t even be bothered to engage in even the most implausible of deniability when it gets caught lying. There’s no one in the administration blaming the misinformation/disinformation flowing from it on interns or hacked accounts or simply failing to have vetted a social media post before it was posted.Officials in President Donald Trump’s administration have used […] misleading footage in at least six videos promoting its immigration agenda shared in the last three months, a Washington Post analysis found, muddying the reality of eventsin viral clips that have been viewed millions of times.Some videos that purported to show the fiery chaos of Trump-targeted cities included footage from completely different states. One that claimed to show dramatic examples of past administrations’ failures instead featured border crossings and smuggling boats recorded during Trump’s first term.This is more of the same, except it’s being done by federal employees and officials, rather than by the faux journalists of the Trump-loving Fox News network. When confronted with these facts, the spokespeople for the DHS and the White House refused to acknowledge the misleading nature of these posts. Instead, they pretended no one had pointed out anything wrong and delivered talking points that talked around what the WaPo journalists were specifically asking them about.The DHS’s Hanoi Hannah — Tricia McLaughlin — pretended the only problem here was people committing crimes, no matter where or when those crimes were committed.DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin did not dispute the errors or explain what had happened but said the videos were a small percentage of the more than 400 that the agency has posted this year. “Violence and rioting against law enforcement is unacceptable regardless of where it occurs,” she said.It’s not just the DHS. It’s also the White House itself.The White House has made notable errors in its own video operation, posting a video this month that claimed “Chicago is in chaos” and said the city “doesn’t need political spin — it needs HELP.”The video, however, recycled footage from a months-old ICE operation in Florida, not far from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club. A fact-checker at Agence France-Presse also found other clips in the video had come from operations in Arizona, California, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas, some of which had been recorded during President Joe Biden’s time in office.Trust me, these aren’t errors. These are deliberate attempts to mislead the people who view these social media posts.And these attempts to mislead were tacitly admitted by the White House. Its spokesperson dodged the accusations, preferring to simply state: we’re doing it for the clicks.Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman there, did not comment on the errors but said “the Trump administration will continue to highlight the many successes of the president’s agenda through engaging content and banger memes on social media.”Not a great response! But it plays to the only crowd that matters: Donald Trump. It plays extremely well with the die hard members of his voting bloc — the ones who will wave the Trump flag no matter what he does. It plays well with the rest of the administration, which is as fully cooked as Trump himself. On top of that, there’s a completely cooked Supreme Court waiting to issue shadow docket hand-waves the next time the administration tramples all over people’s rights. After all, it’s fine with using skin color and/or a “Mexican” accent as the basis for a stop, if not an actual arrest.The DHS can splash whatever it wants all over its social media pages because the only people who care about the truth are those who want to see Trump ejected from office as soon as possible. For everyone else, the truth is just something that gets in the way of a good story. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Holographic Propagators: Geodesics and Local Criticality</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/holographic-propagators-geodesics-and-local-criticality?source=rss</link><author>The Tech Reckoning is Upon Us!</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:15:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The early holographic studies of fermion propagators [28] produced a number of intriguing results, including multiple Fermi surfaces (which merge into one critical ’Fermi ball’ in some extreme limits), dispersionless poles, and oscillatory frequency dependence (which was later shown not to arise in more systematic ’top down’ constructions [26]), etc. A physical interpretation of those results is impeded by the fact that much of this work is numerical.\
A simple and amenable to analytical treatment semiclassical calculation can be performed in the regime mL ≫ 1 where m is a mass of the conjectured dual bulk fermion [28, 29]. In this regime, the fermion’s paths contributing to various quantum-mechanical amplitudes follow closely the classical boundary-to-boundary trajectories (geodesics) derived from the (imaginary-time) action\
by varying over τ(u) and r(u).\
Evaluating this action on its geodesic one obtains\
While an explicit analytic computation of (29) can only be performed in some special cases, the one-parameter space/time dependencies can be readily found for a broad variety of metrics. Specifically, for the HV metric (26) one obtains [29, 30]\
Notably, in the absence of hyperscaling violation (θ = 0) both these asymptotics become either constant (less likely) or logarithmic (more likely, see below). Thus, if the classical EMD Lagrangian (22) were to represent a valid bulk dual of a boundary theory with the gauge-like interaction (1) the asymptotics (31) would not be readily reconcilable with the eikonal/bosonization results (11,21) which depend primarily on z (via η) rather than θ.\
and is composed of the two independent solutions which read\
Imposing the proper boundary conditions and following the holographic dictionary [26] one then defines the propagator as a reflection coefficient for the wave incident at the boundary\
A different behavior (unattainable in the case of a HV metric (26) with finite z and θ) occurs for α = β + 1 in which case the integral in (33) diverges at u → 0. This peculiar NFL regime, dubbed ’local criticality’, is characterized by the propagator\
where a(k), b(k), and ν(k) ∼ k are non-singular functions of momentum that can, in general, produce multiple poles identified as the distinct (’fractionalized’) FS [28].\
Fourier transforming (36) is complicated by the fact that G(ω, k) is not analytically known across the entire range of its arguments. However, the fast (and/or furious) Fourier transformation via a saddle point suggests the following form of this function in the spacetime domain\
Adding to the intrigue, there are some recent Monte Carlo results on the 2d Hubbard and t − J models that have long been thought to represent the prototypical NFL normal state in the cuprates. These results do not readily conform to a momentum-independent, yet strongly energy-dependent, self-energy function, showing less of energy/temperature dependence than any of the above expressions [33]. It remains to be seen as to what this might imply for the general applicability of the theories of fermions (’spinons’) governed by the interactions (1) to the analysis of those microscopic models.(1) D.

The document also says any face photos taken by the app, called Mobile Fortify, will be stored for 15 years, including those of U.S. citizens. 

The document provides new details about the technology behind Mobile Fortify, how the data it collects is processed and stored, and DHS's rationale for using it. On Wednesday 404 Media reported that both ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are scanning peoples' faces in the streets to verify citizenship. 

"ICE does not provide the opportunity for individuals to decline or consent to the collection and use of biometric data/photograph collection," the document, called a Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA), says. A PTA is a document that DHS creates in the process of deploying new technology or updating existing capabilities. It is supposed to be used by DHS's internal privacy offices to determine and describe the privacy risks of a certain piece of tech. "CBP and ICE Privacy are jointly submitting this new mobile app PTA for the ICE Mobile Fortify Mobile App (Mobile Fortify app), a mobile application developed by CBP and made accessible to ICE agents and officers operating in the field," the document, dated February, reads. 404 Media obtained the document (which you can see here) via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with CBP.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia Hopes to Sell Blackwell Chips to China: Huang</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ue-5VgKkMeY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ue-5VgKkMeY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Bloomberg he still hopes to sell chips from the company’s Blackwell lineup to customers in China, though he has no current plans to do so.

Analysts, on average, estimated 18% growth.  Investor expectations for the cloud business were relatively low heading into Thursday’s report after the company in recent quarters cited constraints in getting new data centers online. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy and other executives had said they were optimistic about the business, though they stopped short of forecasting a reacceleration of growth. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Analyst for E-Commerce and Athleisure Poonam Goyal and Bloomberg Tech Co-Host Ed Ludlow join Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss.

How would Canva serve the users who preferred Affinity's perpetually licensed apps to Adobe's subscription-only software suite? And how would Affinity's strong stance against generative AI be reconciled with Canva's embrace of those technologies. 

This week, Canva gave us definitive answers to all of those questions: a brand-new unified Affinity app that melds the Photo, Designer, and Publisher apps into a single piece of software called "Affinity by Canva" that is free to use with a Canva user account, but which gates generative AI features behind Canva's existing paid subscription plans ($120 a year for individuals). 

This does seem like mostly good news, in the near to mid term, for existing Affinity app users who admired Affinity's anti-AI stance: All three apps' core features are free to use, and the stuff you're being asked to pay for is stuff you mostly don't want anyway. But it may come as unwelcome news for those who like the predictability of pay-once-own-forever software or are nervous about where Canva might draw the line between "free" and "premium" features down the line. 

[...] There's now a dedicated page for the older versions of the Affinity apps, and an FAQ at the bottom of that page answers several questions about the fate of those apps. Affinity and Canva say they will continue to keep the activation servers and downloads for all Affinity v1 and v2 apps online for the foreseeable future, giving people who already own the existing apps a way to keep using the versions they're comfortable with. Users can opt to link their Serif Affinity store accounts to their new Canva accounts to access the old downloads without juggling multiple accounts. But those older versions of the apps "won't receive future updates" and won't be able to open files created in the new Canva-branded Affinity app.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tim Cook says Apple is open to M&amp;A on the AI front</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/tim-cook-says-apple-is-open-to-ma-on-the-ai-front/</link><author>Sarah Perez</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 15:17:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook noted in the company's Q4 2025 earnings call that Apple was preparing to announce more AI partnerships like the one it has with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Snow Forecast (2025/10/31)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqpCOYkg3o</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-TqpCOYkg3o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 15:12:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Snow Forecast (2025/10/31)

Those few holographic exercises that do occasionally pop out still tend to begin with the mantra ’holography is well known to be an established method for studying strongly correlated systems’. However, this optimistic reassurance often appears to be in a rather stark contrast with the typical summary that sounds more like ’as no unambiguous agreement with experiment was found, the problem is left to future work’.\
Also, much of the original thrust towards boldly treating an arbitrary condensed matter system of interest as yet another application of some opportunistically chosen weakly-coupled semiclassical gravity has retreated into a ’safer-haven’ topic of hydrodynamics (which, while highlighted and revitalized by holography, can be - and of course had long been - successfully discussed without ever mentioning the latter).\
On the outside, it may seem as though the heuristic ’holo-hacking’ (a.k.a. ’bottom up’ or ’non-AdS/nonCFT’) approach tends to pick out its favorite gravity-like bulk theory on the basis of such physically compelling reasons as an existence of the previously found classical solutions and normal modes’ spectra, availability of the numerical simulation software, or mere need to engage students with the tangible computational tasks.\
However, apart from having become a massive and customary practice, there hasn’t been much effort made towards any serious justification of neither the overall holographic scheme, nor its specific ’dictionary’ which was copy-pasted from the original string-theoretical framework. In that regard, it might be worth keeping in mind that just because everyone else on a highway may be driving above the posted speed limit does not by itself make it legal.\
In light of the above, comparing holographic propagators to the predictions of other techniques could provide an additional testing ground for, both, the alternate methods as well as the holographic approach itself. the bulk metric, gauge, and scalar (dilaton) fields [26]\
Among all the classical solutions of the theory (22) there is a special class of Lifshitz metrics (θ = 0) which were discovered in the semiclassical (ThomasFermi) analysis of matter back-reaction on the metric, as well as in the ’electron star’ scenarios, etc. [27].\
More generally, any viable solutions of (22) must obey certain stability (’null energy’) conditions [26](1) D. V. Khveshchenko, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mariana van Zeller learns the business of manufacturing ghost guns #TraffickedWithMarianavanZeller</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/984DRhJZtPA</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/984DRhJZtPA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 15:00:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Manufacturing ghost guns to be used by cartels in the U.S. and Mexico may be alarming for the average person, but for those involved in this underworld, it's just business.

The huge spending reverses a long period of frugality, in which the country was limited by strict borrowing rules, enshrined in the constitution. Now Chancellor Friedrich Merz is loosening the country`s purse strings and promising swift changes. Can this policy u-turn transform Germany`s economic fortunes and what will it take to turn all this money into growth?

From a report: Speaking with analysts on Amazon's quarterly earnings call Thursday, Jassy said the decision stemmed from a belief that the company had grown too big and too layered. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven -- not right now, at least," he said. "Really, it's culture." 

Jassy's comments are his first public explanation of the layoffs, which reportedly could ultimately total as many as 30,000 people -- and would be the largest workforce reduction in Amazon's history. The news this week prompted speculation that the cuts were tied to automation or AI-related restructuring. Earlier this year, Jassy wrote in a memo to employees that he expected Amazon's total corporate workforce to shrink over time due to efficiency gains from AI. But his comments Thursday framed the layoffs as a cultural reset aimed at keeping the company fast-moving amid what he called "the technology transformation happening right now."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nix Derivation Madness</title><link>https://fzakaria.com/2025/10/29/nix-derivation-madness</link><author>birdculture</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:28:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve written  about Nix and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter. nix-shell  ruby

 which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

 nix-store nix-store which ruby
error: path  is not valid

 /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
: cannot access :
No such file or directory
I have Ruby but I don’t seem to have the derivation, 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g, file present on my machine.No worries, I think I can  it and download it from the NixOS cache. nix-store  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drvI guess the NixOS cache doesn’t seem to have it. 🤷This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are multiplediscourse posts about it.My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the  database. 🤨 sqlite3 
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g, produced this particular Ruby output. curl  https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
What if I try a different command? nix derivation show which ruby | jq 
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

 /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
So I seem to have a completely different derivation, kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5, that resulted in the same output which  what the binary cache announces. WTF? 🫠Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on modulo fixed-output derivations. Is that what’s going on? Let’s investigate from first principles. 🤓Let’s first create  which is our .☝️ Since this is a  (FOD) the produced  path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of . nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

 nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.The  for the output for this derivation  on changes to the derivation  if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it “modulo” the fixed-output derivations. nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

 nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
Let’s test this all out by changing our  derivation.
Let’s do this by just adding some  attribute to the derivation.
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" > "$out"
   '' ];
 nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

 nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
The path of the derivation itself, , has changed but the output path ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1 remains consistent.What about the derivation that leverages it? nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

 nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. 😮That means changes to  didn’t cause new outputs in either derivation  it did create a complete new tree of  files. 🤯That means in nixpkgs changes to  derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their  but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new  and this output path. 💥The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.It can get even weirder! This example came from @ericson2314.We will duplicate the  to another file  whose only difference is the value of the garbage.
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" > "$out"
   '' ];
Let’s now use both of these in our derivation.We can now instantiate and build this as normal. nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv

 nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
What is weird about that?Well, let’s take the JSON representation of the derivation and remove one of the inputs. nix derivation show 
    /nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv 
    jq We can do this because although there are two input derivations, we know they both produce the same output!
       "system": "x86_64-linux"
     },
     "inputDrvs": {
       "/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
         "dynamicOutputs": {},
         "outputs": [
Let’s load this modified derivation back into our  and build it again! nix derivation add < derivation.json
/nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv

 nix-build /nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
We got the same output 211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj. Not only do we have a  trait for our output paths to derivations but we can also take certain derivations and completely change them by removing inputs and still get the same output! 😹The road to Nix enlightenment is no joke and full of dragons.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>In a First, AI Models Analyze Language As Well As a Human Expert</title><link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-a-first-ai-models-analyze-language-as-well-as-a-human-expert-20251031/</link><author>Steve Nadis</author><category>Quanta Magazine</category><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Metalinguistics-cr-Robert-Neubecker-Default.webp" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:28:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Among the myriad abilities that humans possess, which ones are uniquely human?

It takes a LOT of manual work.So, we save you 20+ hours per week by finding every affiliate currently promoting your competitors so you can recruit them, as well as all the top influencers and creators in your niche to build partnerships with.3. What do you love about your team, and why are you the ones to solve this problem?We’re a team of people who all have a LOT of experience in affiliate marketing - either as affiliate marketers ourselves, or as affiliate managers. We get the industry.We know how time-consuming it is to search for new affiliates all the time - and we literally built AffiliateFinder.ai to solve our own problem while running our affiliate management agency! We know what we want in a software like this, so we feel we know exactly how to build this to solve other people having similar problems.4. If you weren’t building your startup, what would you be doing?Probably building a different startup! I really enjoy the game, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.5. At the moment, how do you measure success? What are your metrics?Product feedback, customer growth, and retention. If we don’t have a good product, people will not complete their 7-day free trial, and we won’t grow customers or revenue. Everything we’re focused on now is around retention, and not just building something they’ll use once to get a list of affiliates, but how to make this incredibly helpful as an ongoing companion for all your partner management work.6. In a few sentences, what do you offer to whom?AffiliateFinder.ai helps affiliate, influencer, and partnerships teams 3x their affiliate recruitment by finding all the best-fit potential affiliates for them - and ordering them by priority so they can start with the absolute top partners.We save you 20+ hours per week of boring, manual research - freeing you up to focus on building those relationships with affiliates so they can send you sales while you sleep.It works great, no matter what type of business you are: B2B SaaS, AI, DTC/ecom, travel, iGaming, fintech and trading - we have many customers across all types of businesses.7. What’s most exciting about your traction to date?We’re used by several of the largest companies in the world. It’s always validating when multi-billion dollar companies use your tool and find it valuable enough to use and pay for!And, surprisingly, some of our first customers were forward-thinking managers at these huge companies - they saw our product and instantly understood how it could help them scale their affiliate revenue and outcompete their competition.8. Where do you think your growth will be next year?We’d like to reach 2,000 paying customers by the end of next year, and we’re building to hit that right now.If we can help those 2,000 brands reach their goals by recruiting more partners - then we’ll be extremely happy. We have a lot of great products and features we want to build out, and we’re very excited to build these for the world.9. Tell us about your first paying customer and revenue expectations over the next year.It took us a while to get our first paying customer - a good few months from launch.We originally launched with a freemium option where you’d get your first 15 affiliates for free, and then you had to upgrade yourself to get the full version. But nobody was upgrading!Once we switched to a 7-day free trial, the customers started rolling in.10. What’s your biggest threat?We’re an AI-powered tool, and we use AI to filter out bad-fit affiliates - and recommend the good fits. But, naturally, if there is an extremely advanced AI that can eventually do this all, then this is a huge threat to us. But, we’re working on custom data to make us the most useful tool in affiliate marketing. That hopefully keeps our competitive advantage as AI improves.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nim 2.2.6</title><link>https://nim-lang.org//blog/2025/10/31/nim-226.html</link><author>xz18r</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:15:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains 141 commits, bringing bugfixes and improvements.The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available here.Exception handling combined with Nim’s  is more stable than ever before

The project positions itself as a Real Estate Financing (ReFi) protocol that will modernize how capital flows into property development, but the proof will depend on whether it can deliver where others have failed.\
The timing appears calculated. The tokenized real-world asset market crossed $30 billion in 2025, a figure that reflects roughly a 10-fold increase from 2022 levels. Private credit accounts for approximately $17 billion of this total, while U.S. Treasuries make up $7.3 billion. The momentum suggests that institutions are finding utility in blockchain infrastructure for specific use cases, particularly those involving yield-bearing assets with standardized documentation.Understanding ReFi and What Construct Koin Actually DoesReal Estate Financing through blockchain differs from the property tokenization projects that dominated headlines in previous cycles. Instead of selling fractional ownership in buildings, ReFi protocols focus on the financing process itself. Think of it as digitizing the loan origination and management workflow rather than the asset title.\
Construct Koin operates by connecting property developers who need capital with investors who provide it through token purchases. The platform claims to use artificial intelligence integrated with Building Information Management (BIM) software to analyze development proposals and make lending decisions in hours rather than the weeks or months typical in traditional finance. According to the project website, loans are secured by legal charges registered on title deeds with HM Land Registry in the UK, providing a layer of protection through real property collateral.\
The mechanics work through a loan book model. When developers borrow funds, they pay interest and profit shares back to the protocol. CTK token holders who stake their tokens receive 8 to 12% annual percentage rates paid in USDT stablecoin. The protocol claims it currently has £15 million of assets already secured on-chain, though independent verification of this figure through public blockchain explorers remains limited in available documentation.Breaking Down the $100 Million Presale StructureThe fundraising approach spans 10 phases, each with a price increment. The first phase opened at $0.10 per token, and the final phase will close at $1.00 per token at the Token Generation Event (TGE). The model resembles how venture capital rounds work, with later participants paying higher prices than earlier ones. Out of the 1 billion total token supply, 400 million tokens have been allocated to the presale.\
This represents 40% of the total supply going to public participants. Another 15% has been earmarked for staking rewards, 20% for ecosystem growth, 15% for team and advisors, and 10% for liquidity and reserves. The vesting schedules for team tokens matter here, though specific timeframes were not detailed in the publicly available documentation. Projects that allow insiders to sell immediately after launch have historically faced selling pressure that can depress token prices.\
The presale accepts payments through both fiat channels (credit cards, bank transfers) and six major cryptocurrency networks including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. Minimum purchase amounts vary by network due to transaction fee structures. Ethereum requires a $100 minimum due to higher gas fees, while networks like Polygon and Solana allow $10 minimum purchases. The tokens will remain locked until TGE, which the project estimates will occur 12 to 24 months from launch.The Technology Stack and AI ClaimsThe project emphasizes its use of AI for underwriting decisions. Traditional property development loans can take weeks or months to process as lenders manually review business plans, financial projections, and construction documents. Construct Koin claims its system achieves a 95% speed improvement by automating this analysis through machine learning models that assess risk based on multiple data points.\
The integration with BIM systems provides the AI with access to architectural plans, material specifications, and construction schedules. In theory, this allows the algorithm to evaluate whether a project is feasible, properly costed, and likely to complete on time. The platform processes applications and provides offers in hours rather than weeks, according to marketing materials. However, the details about which specific AI models are being used, what training data they rely on, and how they handle edge cases remain undisclosed.\
The technical infrastructure runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. The smart contracts are described as audited, though the names of the audit firms and links to audit reports were not prominently featured in the reviewed materials. The choice of Ethereum provides compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure and wallet solutions, but it also means users will contend with network congestion and variable transaction fees unless they utilize Layer 2 solutions.Market Context and the RWA SurgeUnderstanding where Construct Koin fits requires context about the broader real-world asset tokenization movement. The sector experienced 380% growth over three years, reaching $24 billion by mid-2025 according to a report by RedStone, Gauntlet, and RWA.xyz. This represents a shift from experimental pilots to scaled institutional adoption, particularly in fixed income and private credit categories.\
Major financial institutions have entered the space. BlackRock launched a $2.9 billion tokenized fund (BUIDL), while Franklin Templeton's tokenized money market fund represents $420 million in assets. Goldman Sachs partnered with BNY Mellon to tokenize money market funds, supported by regulatory frameworks that aim to streamline settlement and reduce costs. The institutional involvement provides validation that blockchain infrastructure can solve real operational problems in capital markets.Who is Building This and Corporate StructureChris Baldrey-Chouro serves as CEO and founder of Construct Koin. According to a podcast interview on The Crypto Podcast, Baldrey-Chouro describes the project as executing "one of the most innovative fundraising strategies in crypto history." His background includes work in recruitment and staffing solutions for commerce, based on corporate registry information.\
This multi-jurisdictional setup is common among crypto projects seeking to optimize for regulatory environments while maintaining operational flexibility. The UK entity provides legitimacy through Companies House registration and operates under UK corporate law. The BVI structure offers advantages for token operations, while the Dubai presence targets the Middle East market, which represents over $2 trillion in real estate value according to project materials.The project positions itself as compliance-first, a pitch aimed at institutional allocators who need legal clarity before committing capital. The protocol includes KYC and AML requirements for all investors, with enhanced due diligence for purchases exceeding $10,000. This approach contrasts with many DeFi protocols that operate pseudonymously or with minimal identity verification.\
The emphasis on milestone-driven disbursements and oracle-verified events addresses one of the key concerns institutional investors have about blockchain-based financing. Traditional tranche financing releases funds only after borrowers meet specific milestones such as completing foundation work or reaching specific construction stages. Construct Koin claims its smart contracts replicate this structure by releasing capital only after verification of progress, reducing the risk of fund misuse.\
The security model relies on conservative loan-to-value ratios of 60 to 70%. This means if a developer defaults, the property securing the loan should be worth significantly more than the outstanding debt, allowing the protocol to recover funds through foreclosure and sale. The protocol also maintains an insurance vault funded by a portion of fees to cover defaults beyond normal parameters. Whether these mechanisms will perform as designed during an actual default scenario remains untested.The Presale Risk Landscape in 2025\
Common red flags in presales include anonymous teams, unrealistic return promises, poorly written whitepapers, unclear tokenomics, and lack of transparency about milestones. Legitimate projects typically disclose team identities, provide detailed technical documentation, show clear roadmaps, and communicate regularly about progress. Projects that lack these elements often disappear after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens.\
The regulatory environment adds another layer of complexity. Crypto projects face scrutiny about whether their tokens constitute securities under various jurisdictions. The classification determines which regulations apply and what disclosures are required. Projects that ignore legal frameworks or operate without proper licensing expose themselves and their investors to enforcement actions, frozen assets, and potential criminal charges.Real Estate Tokenization Track RecordThe history of real estate tokenization projects provides lessons. Multiple ventures have attempted to bring property onto blockchain with mixed results. Early projects focused on fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy shares in specific buildings. These faced challenges with liquidity, regulatory compliance, and the complexity of managing physical assets through digital interfaces.\
More recent projects have shifted toward the financing layer rather than ownership tokenization. This approach encounters fewer regulatory hurdles since it deals with loan products rather than securities representing property ownership. However, the business model still requires borrowers, which means projects must build relationships with developers and prove they can provide capital at competitive rates.\
The question of whether blockchain adds genuine value or merely adds complexity remains contentious. Supporters argue that on-chain transparency, programmable terms, and global capital access justify the technology overhead. Critics point out that traditional finance already has efficient systems for real estate lending and that blockchain's benefits are often overstated relative to implementation costs.Several execution risks warrant examination. First, the loan book model requires a steady pipeline of creditworthy borrowers. If developers can obtain financing through traditional channels at lower costs, they have little incentive to use a new platform that charges fees. The project must either offer better terms than banks or target developers who cannot access traditional financing, which introduces credit risk.\
Second, the AI underwriting system remains largely unproven at scale. While automation can speed processes, it also concentrates risk if the algorithms make systematic errors. A series of bad loans could deplete the insurance fund and leave token holders with losses. The lack of detailed information about the AI's training data, error rates, and decision-making process makes it difficult to assess this risk.\
Third, regulatory changes could impact operations. Governments continue to develop frameworks for crypto assets and tokenized securities. A regulatory crackdown in key markets could force the project to halt operations, delist from exchanges, or face enforcement actions. The multi-jurisdictional structure provides some flexibility but also creates compliance complexity across multiple legal systems.\
Fourth, the token economics depend on sustained borrower demand and investor interest. If loan volume does not grow as projected, staking rewards may decline, reducing demand for the token. If token prices fall significantly below the purchase price, early investors may become discouraged and sell, creating additional downward pressure. The long lock-up period until TGE means investors cannot exit if circumstances change.Looking at established players in the space provides benchmarks. Centrifuge has achieved $1 billion in Total Value Locked, making it the third RWA protocol to reach this milestone. The platform tokenizes invoices, receivables, and trade finance instruments, pushing them into DeFi markets as collateral. Centrifuge completed a V3 migration in 2025, delivering multichain infrastructure across six EVM chains.\
Ondo Finance focuses on institutional-grade tokenized securities and has built infrastructure for bringing fixed-income products on-chain. The platform emphasizes compliance and works within regulatory frameworks rather than attempting to circumvent them. This approach has allowed Ondo to partner with traditional financial institutions and build sustainable business models.\
The difference between these established protocols and a new entrant like Construct Koin lies in track record. Centrifuge and Ondo have processed real transactions, demonstrated their technology works, and built reputations over multiple years. They have also secured institutional backing and navigated regulatory processes. Construct Koin must still prove it can execute its vision and deliver returns to token holders.What The Numbers Actually ShowThe project claims £15 million in assets already secured on-chain. Converting to dollars at current exchange rates gives approximately $19 million in collateral backing the protocol before the presale completes. If the presale reaches its $100 million target, the ratio of raised capital to existing collateral will be roughly 5 to 1. This means the project would need to deploy the raised funds into new loans relatively quickly to maintain proportional backing.\
The staking rewards of 8 to 12% APR paid in USDT require generating sufficient revenue from loan interest and fees. If the protocol charges borrowers 7 to 15% annual interest, as stated in marketing materials, the math works if the majority of loans perform and default rates remain low. However, a 10% default rate combined with recovery costs could quickly consume the margin between what borrowers pay and what stakers receive.\
The tokenomics allocate 15% of supply for staking rewards. With 1 billion total tokens, this equals 150 million tokens reserved for rewards. If tokens reach $1 at TGE as the presale structure suggests, that represents $150 million in value designated for staking. Paying 12% APR on a pool of staked tokens would require substantial protocol revenue, meaning the loan book must grow significantly to sustain these yields.The Bigger Picture: Does ReFi Have Product-Market Fit?The core question is whether blockchain-based real estate financing solves problems that matter to enough participants to create a sustainable market. Developers need capital, and investors want returns. Traditional systems provide both, albeit with friction from intermediaries, paperwork, and slow processes.\
Blockchain's value proposition centers on disintermediation, transparency, and global access. By removing middlemen, protocols can theoretically offer borrowers lower rates and investors higher yields. By recording transactions on-chain, all parties can audit the state of loans in real-time. By operating globally, capital can flow from anywhere to anywhere, removing geographical barriers.\
The counterargument is that the friction in traditional finance exists for reasons. Paperwork and slow processes often serve as risk management mechanisms that prevent bad deals from proceeding. Intermediaries like banks provide expertise in underwriting, legal structuring, and recovery that algorithmic systems may struggle to replicate. Global capital flows sound attractive until investors face losses in foreign jurisdictions where recovering assets is difficult or impossible.After examining the available information about Construct Koin, the project represents both the promise and peril of real-world asset tokenization in its current phase. The promise lies in the genuine growth of the RWA sector, which has demonstrated that certain use cases have found product-market fit. The peril comes from execution risk, regulatory uncertainty, and the long history of crypto projects that fail to deliver on ambitious visions.\
The data points to consider are straightforward. The RWA market is real and growing, reaching $30 billion with institutional participation from major financial players. Real estate represents the largest asset class globally at over $300 trillion, meaning even a tiny percentage of tokenization would create enormous value. The technology for tokenizing loans and managing them through smart contracts exists and has been deployed by other projects successfully.\
Against this, the presale model concentrates risk on early participants who must wait 12 to 24 months for tokens to unlock while hoping the project executes. The team, while public, does not appear to have prior experience building DeFi protocols or managing large-scale lending operations. The AI claims lack substantiation through independent testing or published benchmarks. The regulatory landscape remains fluid, with governments still determining how to classify and regulate tokenized assets.\
The honest assessment is that Construct Koin is attempting something difficult that, if successful, could generate returns for early participants. It is also attempting something that could fail for multiple reasons including poor execution, regulatory intervention, lack of borrower adoption, or macroeconomic changes that reduce demand for real estate development financing. Potential participants should view this as a high-risk investment where capital loss is a realistic outcome, not merely a theoretical possibility disclosed in legal disclaimers.\
The project would benefit from greater transparency about its AI technology, more detailed disclosure of its existing loan book, and clearer communication about partnerships with developers who will actually use the platform. Without these elements, investors are essentially betting on a vision backed by marketing materials rather than proven operational metrics.\
In a market where over half of projects fail, the bar for success is high. Whether Construct Koin clears that bar will depend on execution over the coming years, not on the quality of its presale marketing or the size of its fundraising target.\

While the Moldovan capital Chişinău tends to pursue a more pro-European course, many people in Transnistria cling to Russia – despite problems like Transnistria's deep poverty. The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures. 

Until the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act – as some 80 percent of Transnistria's exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region.  

While pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU.

Despite a strong strategy, Adobe is "at risk of structural AI-driven competitive and pricing pressure," wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. The company's shares have lost about a quarter of their value this year as AI tools like Google's video-generating model Veo have gained steam.

In 1996 the American political scientist Samuel Huntington published "The Clash of Civilisations and the remaking of the world order". Largely dismissed at the time of publication, and mostly mocked by students in the fields of Political Science and IR, the book has nevertheless remained relevant. From various figures in the MAGA movement to a new generation of rightwing politicians in Europe, Huntington's theory of a world in conflict between different civilisations defined by different cultures, continues to be cited in proposals of policy and to set the agendas.

In this video I examine Huntington's theory of a clash of civilisations caused by differences in culture, and try my best to present you with a critique.

Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [1]. In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus  (shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the electrical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance. Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also highlight the potential for scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly neuromorphic components.Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [1]. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-speed decision-making in dynamic environments [2].Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [3]. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control variables [4]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [4].Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes, and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments [4]. This is complemented by the precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining stability and performance while following desired trajectories [5].Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [2].Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However, the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semiconductor foundries.Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives [6,7].First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose environmental challenges [6,7]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic materials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [8].Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [9,10]. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [11].Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [12]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [13].Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [14].The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (), as organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [6,7,13]. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [15]. Highly conductive carbon materials have been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [16]. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic components [17]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy storage applications [17]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [18].In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [19,20]. This intersection of biology and electronics opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.Radiation, resistance, and resilienceThe radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress [21], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms.Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [22]. This radiation resistance implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous relative to conventional solutions [18,19]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation [23]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D when subjected to ultraviolet light [24].Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [22]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deadly floods hit central Vietnam | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GpSEIQaHWpg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GpSEIQaHWpg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:30:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Record floods hit central Vietnam, killing over a dozen people and inundating the former imperial capital Hue and the tourism hub Hoi An.

Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.Lewis is the senior author of the study, which appears today in . MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang is the lead author of the paper.Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019 study, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow come with the cost of attention loss.“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html</link><author>reaperducer</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:03:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology. They are also driven, he argues, by new ways of paying for them.“There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than  into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying  needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than  for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received  in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a  investment in OpenAI.At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising  to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend  building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these  over the next several years.The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly  for OpenAI in the Emirates.Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest  in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.Two weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to  in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How therapy-speak can be more harmful than helpful #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/14v-sAUsn4g</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/14v-sAUsn4g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gaslighting. Narcissist. You’ve probably heard these terms used a lot more frequently in recent years. They’re pop psychology terms, also known as therapy-speak, and they’ve become increasingly common in our mainstream vernacular. But oftentimes, people misuse the terminology and let it serve as a blanket term for more complex thoughts and feelings, making it more difficult to receive proper mental health support for clinical diagnoses. Vox correspondent Allie Volpe explains why therapy-speak is so alluring, and how to use more words, not fewer, to describe a situation.

One coating made from a porous film, which can be painted on to existing roofs, works by reflecting 96% of incoming solar radiation, rather than absorbing the sun's energy. It also has a high thermal emittance, meaning it effectively dissipates heat to outer space when the sky is clear. Its properties are known as passive radiative cooling. [...]
 
In a study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the researchers tested a prototype for six months on the roof of the Sydney Nanoscience Hub, pairing the cool paint with a UV-resistant topcoat that encouraged dew droplets to roll down into a receptacle. As much as 390 milliliters per sq meter per day could be collected for about a third of the year, the scientists found. Based on that water capture rate, an average Australian roof -- about 200 sq meters -- could provide up to 70 liters on days favorable for collecting dew, they estimate. [...]
 
In well-insulated buildings, a 6C decrease in roof temperature "might result in a smaller fraction of that cooling being reflected in the top level of the house," [said the study's lead author, Prof Chiara Neto of the University of Sydney], but greater temperature reductions would be expected in most Australian houses, "where insulation is quite poor." She said the coating could also help reduce the urban heat island effect, in which hard surfaces absorb more heat than natural surfaces, resulting in urban centers being 1C to 13C warmer than rural areas. The researchers found that the prototype coating was comprised of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene), which is used in the building industry but was "not a scalable technology going forward" due to its environmental issues. However, they are now commercializing a water-based paint with similar performance that is affordable and environmentally safer, costing about the same as standard premium paints.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US slashes number of refugees, prioritizes Afrikaners | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8bTSnridSk</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/z8bTSnridSk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:51:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump's administration plans to admit far fewer refugees from the entire world in the coming year.

Amazon surged 12% in premarket trading on its fastest cloud-unit growth in nearly three years, while Apple gained on a revenue beat and upbeat holiday forecast. 

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hopes to sell chips from the company's Blackwell lineup to customers in China someday. “No decisions have been made, and we’ll see how it turns out,” Huang said Friday in South Korea. The Nvidia chief said earlier this week that the company hasn’t applied for Washington’s permission to sell Blackwell chips to China, permits that are required under export controls first imposed in 2022.

You see this most profoundly in media, where a bunch of far-too-clever lads rushed to integrate under-cooked, broadly misunderstood LLMs with disastrous results. As it turns out, training LLMs on this kind of slop doesn’t work out well for anybody.A new joint study by researchers at Texas A&M University, University of Texas at Austin, and Purdue University took a closer look at what happens when you train LLMs on the kind of engagement slop our modern internet gatekeepers are keen to create. To see how these models would “behave” after subsisting on a diet of clickbait sewage, the researchers cobbled together a sample of one million X posts and then trained four different LLMs on varying mixtures of control data (long form, good faith, real articles and content) and junk data (lazy, engagement chasing, superficial clickbait) to see how it would affect performance.“All four models tested—Llama3 8B, Qwen2.5 7B/0.5B, Qwen3 4B—showed some forms of cognitive decline. Meta’s Llama proved the most sensitive to the junk, seeing drops in its reasoning capabilities, understanding of context, and adherence to safety standards. Interestingly, a much smaller model, Qwen 3 4B, proved more resilient, though still suffered declines. It also found that the higher the rates of bad data, the more likely a model was to slip into “no thinking” mode, failing to provide any reasoning for its answer, which was more likely to be inaccurate.”They also found that after being fed a bunch of ex-Twitter slop, the models didn’t just get “dumber”, they were (shocking, I know) far more likely to take on many of the nastier “personality traits” that now dominate the right wing troll platform:“More than just getting “dumber” in its thinking, though, the researchers found the inclusion of junk also resulted in an interesting effect: it led to changes in the model’s “personality,” succumbing to what the researchers called “dark traits.” For instance, the Llama 3 model displayed significantly higher levels of narcissism and became less agreeable. It also went from displaying nearly no signs of psychopathy to extremely high rates of the behavior.”And by “dumber” and “narcissistic” they of course mean a vague simulacrum of those personality traits, because modern LLMs don’t  anything, much less adopt real personalities. You’ll often see people (even prominent NYT tech journalists) attributing malicious intent and understanding to language learning models, inadvertently advertising the fact they don’t know how any of this works. There’s been so much misrepresentation of what these models are capable of (by both companies and the tech media), this comment below needs to be projected onto the moon:Chatbots — LLMs — do not know facts and are not designed to be able to accurately answer factual questions. They are designed to find and mimic patterns of words, probabilistically. When they’re “right” it’s because correct things are often written down, so those patterns are frequent. That’s all.You see this a lot in breathless articles about LLMs that are trying to “resist being shut off” or somehow “blackmail their operators.” It’s simply not how this technology actually works. It’s part of a con suggesting these models are just a few weeks and another billion away from HAL 900 sentience. Again, none of this is to say LLMs don’t have very useful applications, such as examining vast troves of scientific data to look for patterns and facts that humans might miss. Or creating more efficient, “intelligent” software that can be predictive of the user’s needs or inputs. Or automating basic customer service inquiries in a world full of already-low quality outsourced support. The problem with AI generally is a decidedly human one: the terrible, unethical, and greedy people currently in charge of it’s implementation (again, see media, insurance, countless others) — folks who have cultivated some unrealistic delusions about AI competency and efficiency (see this recent Stanford study on how rushed AI adoption in the workforce often makes people less efficient).This is before you even get to the climate and energy impact of these models, or the fact that the underlying financials are a hot mess poised to cause some serious economic tumult next year as the outer layer of hype and misrepresentation burns off. Even then, this quest to turn the internet into an ocean of lazy and uncurated ad engagement slop will remain a centerpiece of the movement.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Key Highlights From Trump’s Asia Visit</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sxSkZeuKN5Q</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sxSkZeuKN5Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:17:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump has wrapped up his trip to Asia, signing deals at every stop.

Taking inspiration from Simon Willison, this post is an annotated presentation containing my slides and detailed notes on them. The talk also has a lot of UI demos: for these, I’ll have a screenshot but also a link to the relevant part of the video (videos are unbeatable for UI!).First, what is Perfetto? Perfetto is fundamentally a suite of tools: it’s not just one thing but a bunch of different tools working together to help you debug and root-cause problems. This diagram shows how everything fits together, with the core parts of the Perfetto project in the center.The recording tools for Perfetto consist of 1) an SDK for C++ apps 2) a daemon that can collect data from ftrace, /proc, /sys, and various kernel interfaces 3) another daemon that amalgamates trace data from multiple processes into a single trace file. These tools all speak the Perfetto protobuf format, a high-performance trace format designed to be very efficient to write but not to analyze or consume directly.That’s where the trace processor comes in. It’s a C++ library that parses the protobuf format, but also a bunch of other widely used trace formats. It exposes this data via an SQL query interface to any embedding program including Perfetto UI (which is what most of this talk is about) and also to the Python API if you want to do ad-hoc scripting or analysis in Python.There are also very common tracing/profiling formats used by the Linux community: perf.data, ftrace text format, Firefox profiler format, and many others. Perfetto supports quite a few of those directly. There’s also the Chrome JSON format (AKA the Trace Event Format) which is a simpler interchange format. It’s not the most efficient to read or write, but it does the job for a lot of use cases.Often people write converters. They have their own tracing format, maybe proprietary, maybe open source but something we don’t know about, and it’s very common that people convert to one of the formats we understand, most commonly our protobuf or Chrome JSON formats.The Perfetto UI is fundamentally a web-based trace visualizer, combining timeline visualization, user-driven selection/aggregation, and SQL queries all in one interface. Because it has the trace processor as a backend, it works with a bunch of different trace formats.It’s very important to note that even though the Perfetto UI is web-based, everything happens inside your browser and trace data never leaves your system. You can even build it and host it yourself on any static server: we’ve made it extremely easy to do so!At the start of 2025, we actually moved our whole development to GitHub. In the past, we used to develop on Android and GitHub was just a mirror. That’s no longer the case, GitHub is actually where we develop and take pull requests.Most of this talk, I’m going to spend actually showing you how you can use the Perfetto UI to debug performance issues on Linux. I don’t want to show you an Android trace which needs a lot of context about how the Android system works and so you think, “oh, that was cool, but I didn’t really understand what was happening.”So to make this talk more approachable, I wrote a straightforward demo program you can look at yourself! So it’s obviously not a production system but I’ve tried to make it as representative of the sort of issues we use Perfetto for every day.It’s a Rust program which generates a Julia set and visualizes it over time. The technologies I used: Vulkan, GPU rendering and also multi-threaded CPU computation. So how it works is that computation of various parameters is happening on background threads, and then that’s being passed to the main thread for rendering.And then, for demonstration purposes, there is a performance bug; rendering should run at 60 FPS, but every so often, the frame rate drops dramatically. Here’s what that looks like:The code is on GitHub and if you’re interested in following along. The traces are there as well - you don’t have to collect the traces yourself, but you can if you want. All the instructions and information is in the README.So the first suspicion we may have is that maybe it’s some CPU problem. A lot of engineers I know would reach for perf immediately whenever they see a problem like this. The main reason is that if perf can capture the problem, they can go straight to the line of code without needing to spend time debugging using more complex approaches.You can record a perf profile with perf record -k mono -g ./fractal_renderer. The standard post-processing step which I think a lot of people do would be to generate an SVG flame graph out of this with perf script | stack-collapse-perf.pl --all | flamegraph.pl > fractal-frame.svg. Here’s how that looks like for our perf profile:The flame graph shows the thread names at the bottom, and then stacked above are the call stacks of what the program is doing. The width represents how much time is spent in each function. In this case, the worker threads are spending most of their time in  and  operations, doing math computation. Exactly what you’d expect for this type of program. Aside: Interestingly demangling didn’t seem to work for Rust out of the box which I find a bit unusual but I didn’t dig too much into why this was.Looking at this, nothing really stands out. There’s no smoking gun that immediately reveals the problem. But here’s the fundamental limitation: the flame graph aggregates data across the entire trace, losing the time dimension. The performance problem we’re seeing happens every 2-3 seconds - brief drops in an otherwise normally functioning program.The flame graph shows me the aggregate, dominated by the correct behavior, making it nearly impossible to spot those occasional problematic moments. So how do I find the places where it’s doing the wrong thing?Well, that’s maybe where Perfetto can help you out a little bit! The thing I find lots of people don’t know is that perf actually  timestamp information about when samples were taken: many tools drop this information but Perfetto is pretty good at showing that to you. I just need post-process the trace with perf script > fractal.perftext to generate a text version of the profile which we can then open in the Perfetto UIMy demo talking through how to open the perf profile and navigate it starts at 9:11 in the video.The x-axis of what you’re seeing is time. And every horizontal line represents a thread: we call these lanes “tracks”. And each of the small arrowheads on the tracks are CPU samples for the associated thread.The behavior of the worker threads over time is really interesting. Most of the lifetime of the program, it’s doing continuous computation, basically. And then there’s this period of time in the middle where there’s this very interesting staircase pattern where it seems like only one thread is running at any one time: we’ll want to keep a note of this as this is quite important.One very cool thing about Perfetto is that it allows me to quickly generate visualizations of whatever I’m selecting on the timeline. We call this “area selection” and it’s where I drag my mouse and select a region both horizontally and vertically. This is on one track but even  multiple tracks. So in the timeline it shows me the selection I’m making at the top, plus a flame graph at the bottom representing the aggregation of the samples in just that time period.The key advantage is that I can look at individual regions of time interactively. You can also do this with  but you need to pre-filter the data to what you’re looking for. This assumes you already know what the problem is before you find it. I always find that a bit counterintuitive. I prefer this view where I can see everything first, then decide “I want to look at this specific part in more detail.” That’s what Perfetto lets me do.So now on to the flame graph itself: in the last year, I spent a bunch of time on improving the flame graph visualization in Perfetto UI. At Google, we have an internal tool called pprof (related to but not the same as the open-source one), and I’ve always loved the visualization it has. So I worked to make Perfetto’s flame graph look and behave very similarly.There are a bunch of features here. You can zoom in like most flame graph, but you can also say “I only want to look at the stack starting from this point” — it gets rid of everything above and starts fresh from there. If I don’t want to see a particular function like , I can just hide the frame and it gets merged into its parent. The search is regex-based so I can also just type the specific things I’m interested in: it’s pretty powerful.There’s also something I don’t think I’ve seen in other visualizers (I might be wrong, please do correct me!): what I call “bottom up” view. Imagine you take all the leaves across your entire program and visualize who’s calling into them. If you have a leaf function that’s called everywhere in your program but reached from many different places, it’ll be split across your flame chart. This is the inverse — you’re looking at the leaves and asking “who is calling me?” This is particularly useful when you’re trying to optimize very low-level functions that are always at the leaf level — things like memcpy or hashmap operations.So our main takeaway is that our worker threads all had gaps in their CPU execution in a staircase pattern. This means the threads weren’t actually on the CPU and that’s usually a sign that they’re sleeping.But sleeping on what? Locks? Disk? Network? What exactly is happening? To answer that, I need a scheduler trace to show me the wake-up patterns, who’s being scheduled when, what type of sleep threads are in, that sort of thing.We recently added support for trace-cmd’s text format in Perfetto (aside: there’s an open issue to support the binary format too!). For this demo, I’m collecting sched_switch and sched_waking events with sudo trace-cmd record -e sched:sched_switch -e sched:sched_waking -C mono ./fractal-renderer-vk and we can open it in the UI once we do trace-cmd report -N > fractal.sched.The demo showing off scheduler traces starts at 15:16 in the video.So this is what a scheduler trace looks like. Again as before, the x-axis is time. At the top of the trace, you’ve got the CPU scheduling tracks. For each CPU, they tell us what was scheduled on that CPU at each point in time. The white regions are where there’s nothing scheduled. As I zoom in, you start to see information like the name of the thread that’s scheduled, the TID of the thread, and so on. This is the CPU view of things, looking at it from a CPU perspective.There’s also a thread perspective on scheduling: what we call this “thread state”. This shows the scheduling state of each thread at every point in time. Dark green represents the thread running, light green represents runnable (the thread is on the runqueue so it’s eligible to run, but the scheduler hasn’t actually let it run yet), and white represents interruptible sleep (S sleep). There are also orange regions for uninterruptible sleep (D sleep), though that doesn’t show up much in this trace.You can again see a very clear staircase-like pattern. Again, only one thread seems to be running at any one time. You’re maybe getting the sense of what the problem might be at this point.Like with the perf visualization, you can do area selections here too. I can select a region on a CPU and get tables showing time spent by each thread (shown in the screenshot above). I can also do this for thread state, you can also see that runnable time is basically negligible compared to running and sleeping, which is where most of the time is being spent.There are also scheduler-specific visualizations like run queue length and active CPU count. You can see in the problematic region, the active CPU count also went down, which makes sense.So the scheduler trace shows when threads are sleeping, but it’s not telling us why. What was the program doing in that region? What code was it running? The sequential pattern suggests some sort of serialization—something is causing only one thread to run at a time. But we need application-level visibility.Since this program was written in Rust, I just used the off-the-shelf  and  crates; I did have to make some small modifications to tracing-perfetto that I’m hoping to upstream. These output a Perfetto trace without needing to use the Perfetto SDK. These libraries are also maintained by others: we don’t have any hand in them.All I needed to do was integrate these into my program and then add a command line switch to write out the collected trace to a file. So I just do ./fractal_renderer --trace fractal.pftraceMy demo for app tracing starts at 19:37 in the video.Looking at the app trace: as before x-axis is time and each of the tracks represents a thread. Instead of scheduling activity or CPU stack samples, this time the tracks is userspace instrumentation of the program itself. Each of these rectangles is a named period of time representing what the program was doing at that time.There are lots of different names for these in the tracing world (e.g. spans, intervals) but we call these “slices”. The main thread is rendering frames as you would expect and the workers are each computing tiles of that frame, which eventually feed back to the main thread and sync to the GPU.There’s also this thing called flows, which shows the causal links between different pieces. Render frame is calling into all these places and causing them to happen. It’s sort of similar to wakeup graphs but for user space: basically, this is what caused me to start running this function.So you can see very clearly there’s a normal region and then a region where things are taking 1.8 seconds: almost certainly the cause of the frame drops.And if we look at the slice in question, it seems to be doing something called “update adaptive quality.” Basically, I wrote some code to dynamically change the rendering quality based on frame rate. If I’m running faster, I can render at higher quality. If I’m running slower, I can do lower quality. That’s what this adaptive quality thing is supposed to do.But clearly something has gone wrong. I’m causing frame drops because of updates to adaptive quality. A little bit ironic, to say the least. Now we know what the program is actually doing during that time span.So now we’ve looked at three different sources of debugging data separately. In perf, we got told there are few or no CPU samples and weird staircase patterns. In ftrace, we saw only one worker seems to be active and the rest are sleeping in interruptible sleep. And in app tracing, we see it’s because of adaptive quality updates that workers are working on, and they shouldn’t be doing it this way.Obviously, the theory is that it’s all the same problem. But we can confirm this theory with a very new (and still experimental) feature of the UI: trace merging.Note: as this part of Perfetto is still experimental, if you want to try it yourself, you need to go to plugins and enable the “MultiTraceOpen” plugin. Also, unlike I what say in the talk, you do  need to be on Autopush as all the features I showed in my talk are now available in Stable.The demo showing off merged traces starts at 24:32 in the video.This is now the merged trace file containing all the different information. You can see the CPU scheduling tracks like we had in the scheduler trace, the stack samples like we had in the perf trace, and the app instrumentation, all beside each other on one timeline.
You can very clearly see the adaptive quality update running, then this period where it ran, and then it was done. It’s very cool to be able to see the pattern of how my program is sleeping and where and what it was running on one timeline.The thing is, you’ve always been able to do this with Perfetto if you collect a Perfetto trace with all of these integrated. The new capability is that this is now being brought to traces you didn’t collect with Perfetto. Collect it with whatever you like, and we’ll still manage to do this visualization. That’s the new capability we have.There’s also a query interface which we’ve been building out recently and there are some pretty powerful things you can do with these tables. As well as the flat tables of data, there’s also a more dynamic pivot table and if I click the arrow on the left, I can get into a detailed filter table, similar to a spreadsheet but optimize for things people want to do on traces.For example, by doing an area select, I can first get a list of all the events that happened during a time region. Then using the table I can filter for things - say I only care about slices longer than some duration, like 319 microseconds for whatever reason. I can click and add a filter for things greater than this.There’s also a feature called “Show Debug Track” that’s also very powerful. The table shows rows with timestamped duration information, and this feature lets you visualize that data as a track on the timeline. It adds a track at the top showing the regions of time where these events happened—in this case, where ComputeTile took longer than a certain threshold.This is particularly useful for correlation analysis. For example, in Android, we’re often looking at system A and trying to understand its effect on system B. We find all the places where one thing is slow, then look for correlations. Being able to see a track in the UI where you can quickly have context and say “oh, during this period of time, this other thing was happening” is invaluable. It’s probably one of our most-used features.You can also copy the SQL query from these tables and start doing your own aggregations on top of it. This eases the burden of starting with a completely blank canvas. Instead of wondering “where do I even start querying my data? What tables is my data in?”, the UI gives you a starting query that you can build on without needing to write something from scratch.So the dynamic quality updates were stopping the world. Perf profiling showed the problem, scheduler traces found the sleeping pattern, app tracing confirmed it was the quality adjustment code, and the single timeline view let me see everything happening at once.Interestingly, I tried to fix this by removing the lock contention—which I thought was the bug I had introduced. But it turns out I shouldn’t have been doing this code in the workers in the first place. Even after removing the lock contention, just the CPU activity of doing that work was enough to cause frame drops. The right solution was to move it to a background thread. As part of debugging this for the demo, I discovered something even better that I could be doing.Android and Chrome are our bread and butter—that’s what we officially support as a team, and why Google staffs us. But there are many other interesting uses.Mesa uses Perfetto as one of its tracing systems. One thing I could have shown is collecting a Mesa trace alongside all the other traces we looked at—you can actually see what the GPU is doing at the same time, which would have been very cool, but I just didn’t have time.VizTracer is function tracing for Python, similar to uftrace, but you don’t have to recompile anything or do anything special.pthread_trace is for visualizing pthread mutex contention. The author has a very efficient way of doing this and writes protobuf using heavy use of constexpr to make it very low overhead. It’s a very interesting project.magic-trace uses Intel Processor Trace for function-level tracing at the processor level with lower overhead. They wrote a converter from that to the Perfetto format so you can visualize that data in Perfetto.Qais Yousef’s sched-analyzer enriches Perfetto traces with scheduler internals. It’s a very cool project that I find particularly interesting.Finally, Josef Bacik’s systing is a bit experimental but fascinating. He re-implemented tracing daemons on top of BPF instead of Perfetto’s native implementation, combining BPF-based tracing with perf stack traces in a single binary. He has a blog post explaining why. I thought it was a fascinating use of Perfetto.If you want to try this yourself, you can use the demo program I’ve provided. But even better: record traces on your own programs. Open scheduler traces and perf at the same time. Instrument your program, convert it to Perfetto format, and visualize everything together.If you want to convert ad-hoc timestamped data to Perfetto, we wrote a comprehensive tutorial with Python snippets for everything you might want to visualize. It covers all the features I showed and how to write Python code to generate them. We have a library for writing these traces: besides this one library, you don’t need to install anything else. You can go ahead and convert your own data to Perfetto.We’re very happy to accept contributions and review pull requests pretty quickly. We’ve had a lot of open-source contributors over the years and have been quite lucky with some very high-quality contributions. If you want to contribute yourself or have a feature you feel is missing, send it our way.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The cryptography behind electronic passports</title><link>https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/10/31/the-cryptography-behind-electronic-passports/</link><author>tatersolid</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:33:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know that most modern passports are actually embedded devices containing an entire filesystem, access controls, and support for several cryptographic protocols? Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.Electronic passport basicsA passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in ICAO Doc 9303; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).How the eMRTD application worksThe following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.Digging into the threat modelElectronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:Read any personal information from that passportEavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminalsFigure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movementsEven if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:Forge a new passport with inauthentic dataMake a digital copy of the passportRead the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) informationElectronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control failsIn order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for oracle attacks that allow tracing by replaying valid terminal responses.Forgery prevention: Got it right the first timePreventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remainPreventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography.Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channelCA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problemsThe main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive a password key. Next, the passport encrypts a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyoneWhen considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system  with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofsAn emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service.Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider. If you’re implementing ZK proofs of identity documents, contact us to evaluate your design and implementation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Clash in Ankara: Erdogan&apos;s outcry meets Merz&apos;s diplomatic caution | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaK3yo2QBT0</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AaK3yo2QBT0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:14:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for a deepening of ties between the EU and Turkey on his first official visit to the country.

year and wanted to share a few short impressions. As always, I am not a
professional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just
subjective thoughts!Back in 2021, I wrote about the MacBook Air
M1, which was the first computer I used that
contained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery
life was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year
old MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more
years. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could
have stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.The nano-textured displayI went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in
person. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased
weight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be
acceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I
really like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro
owners that the fan mostly stays off.In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has
enough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation
slots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented
the trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing
reflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:
The bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display
(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was
clear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for
the nano texture display!After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this
choice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous
laptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next
to the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have
released the first devices with M5 chips.)I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4  chip
because I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4
Pro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.Here are the specs I ended up with:14" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano textureApple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it
is connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for
hours). I’m not sure why.Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once
in half a year or so?The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day
battery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,
watching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of
battery life. I generally never even carry the charger.Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector
(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but
doesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to
pack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you
use the charger.I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I
mostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,
for example, when scrolling.One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations
can become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on , I
noticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120
Hz display!The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms
of processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average
case and the worst case):Best case: Page load finishes  the next frame is displayed: no delay.Worst case: Page load finishes  a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delayAs you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one
frame every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with
a system that has <8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up
to) twice as fast!I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,
where a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120
Hz displays are more interesting.My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But
Asahi Linux still needs some work before it’s usable
for me (I need external display output, and M4 support). This doesn’t bother me
too much, though, as I don’t use this computer for serious work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AerynOS 2025.10 ISOs Released - GNOME 49, Switches Back To GNU libstdc++</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AerynOS-2025.10-ISOs</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:12:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AerynOS 2025.10 ISOs were released today for closing out the month of October.

In fact, it has been shown that if you connect two clocks, they will eventually synchronize their ticking. Distinguished Professor of Physics and Neurobiology David Kleinfeld found that if he applied an external stimulus to a neuron, the entire vasculature would lock at the same frequency. However, if he stimulated two sets of neurons at two different frequencies, something unexpected happened: some arterioles would lock at one frequency and others would lock at another frequency, forming a staircase effect.
 
Searching for an explanation, Kleinfeld enlisted the help of his colleague, Professor of Physics Massimo Vergassola, who specializes in understanding the physics of living systems, and then recruited Ecole Normale Superieure graduate student Marie Sellier-Prono and Senior Researcher at the Institute for Complex Systems Massimo Cencini. Together, the researchers found they could use a classical model of coupled oscillators with an intestinal twist. The gut oscillates naturally due to peristalsis -- the contracting and relaxing of muscles in the digestive tract -- and provided a simplified model over the complex network of blood vessels in the brain. The intestine is unidirectional, meaning frequencies shift in one direction in a gradient from higher to lower. This is what enables food to move in one direction from the beginning of the small intestine to the end of the large intestine.
 
"Coupled oscillators talk to each other and each section of the intestine is an oscillator that talks to the other sections near it," stated Vergassola. "Normally, coupled oscillators are studied in a homogeneous setting, meaning all the oscillators are at more or less similar frequencies. In our case, the oscillators were more varied, just as in the intestine and the brain." In studying the coupled oscillators in the gut, past researchers observed that there is indeed a staircase effect where similar frequencies lock onto those around it, allowing for the rhythmic movement of food through the digestive tract. But the height of the rises or breaks, the length of the stair runs or frequencies, and the conditions under which the staircase phenomenon occurred -- essential features of biological systems -- was something which had not been determined until now. The findings have been published in the journal Physical Review Letters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vulkan 1.4.331 Brings Two New Extensions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Vulkan-1.4.331-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:48:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just one week after Vulkan 1.4.330 brought five new extensions, Vulkan 1.4.331 is now available with another two new extensions for this high performance graphics and compute API...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How much packaging waste do EU citizens produce?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqIGgX77UEE</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LqIGgX77UEE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:44:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite packaging waste having risen over the past decade, seven EU countries achieved the 2030 goal of recycling at least 70% of all packaging waste as early as 2023.

The release introduces Blended Identity, which defines how AI agents act on behalf of verified users, and the MCP Identity Gateway, which ensures secure access to enterprise resources based on identity, access policy, and runtime attributes.The new offering extends the Aembit Workload IAM Platform to address one of the most pressing operational questions in artificial intelligence and modern IT: how to control what autonomous and user-driven AI agents can access, under what conditions, and with what accountability.AI agents are rapidly becoming a key part of enterprise operations. Nearly half of technology executives say they are already adopting or fully deploying agentic AI, and about the same share expect most of their AI deployments to be autonomous within two years, according to an . These agents retrieve sensitive data, open tickets, and execute code across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS environments.Yet most access models were built for people, not self-directed software. Many still rely on static secrets and shared credentials, creating risk and obscuring accountability. Worse yet, agents’ actions are often hidden behind the identity of a human, making it almost impossible to audit the actions each actor has taken. The result is a widening gap between the pace of AI adoption and the ability of organizations to secure it with confidence. assigns each agent a cryptographically verified identity, issues ephemeral credentials, and enforces policy at runtime. The system records every access decision and maintains attribution across both human-driven and autonomous agent activity. By bringing agent activity under the same centralized policy control plane that governs other workloads, Aembit enables enterprises to deploy AI at scale while maintaining control, auditability, and compliance.“Enterprises want to say yes to agentic AI, and they’re asking Aembit for ways to securely grant agents access to data and applications,” said David Goldschlag, co-founder and CEO of Aembit. “Aembit IAM for Agentic AI gives enterprises the same level of control and audit over agent access that IAM systems have long provided for employees. Our approach enables organizations to advance their AI initiatives without expanding their threat and risk surface.”The release introduces two core capabilities to the Aembit Workload IAM Platform:Blended Identity, which gives every AI agent its own verified identity and, when needed, binds it to the human it represents. This establishes a single, traceable identity for each agent action and allows Aembit to issue a secure credential that reflects that combined context.MCP Identity Gateway, which receives that identity credential and controls how agents connect to tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The gateway authenticates the agent, enforces policy, and performs token exchange to securely retrieve the necessary access permissions for each connected resource – without ever exposing them to the agent runtime.Together, this functionality allows enterprises to apply least-privilege access, revoke permissions immediately when needed, and ensure that every AI action is attributable and auditable. They operate on Aembit’s established Workload IAM foundation, which enforces policy dynamically at runtime, issues ephemeral credentials just in time, and records structured events for full traceability.Aembit developed IAM for Agentic AI through collaboration with large businesses, government organizations, and innovative agentic AI startups deploying AI for operational and security workloads. Those efforts helped shape an approach that combines enterprise enforcement with the adaptability AI projects demand.“AI agents don’t live inside one stack or trust domain,” said Kevin Sapp, co-founder and CTO of Aembit. “They move between hybrid environments in seconds. With Aembit, every agent carries a verified identity that our gateway can authenticate and control in real time. It’s how enterprises can give agents the access they need to work, while never losing sight of who they are or what they touch.”Aembit IAM for Agentic AI is now available to customers using its Workload IAM Platform. Organizations can learn more, request a demo, or get started today at . is the identity and access management platform for agentic AI and workloads. It enforces access based on identity, context, and centrally managed policies, giving organizations a singular place to control access risk from AI agents, automate credential management, and accelerate AI adoption. With Aembit, enterprises can confidently control access to sensitive resources across all the workloads that power their business.:::tip

It is a surprisingly hard problem and I want to talk about some of the issues we faced.What about the Open Source that UK Government ?Open Source is facing a crisis. The code that the world relies on is often developed by underpaid engineers on the brink of burn-out.  While I don't think anyone wants Open Source to have a paywall, it seems obvious that large organisation should pay their way and not rely solely on volunteer labour.Here are some of the problems I faced when trying to get the UK Government to pay for OSS and how  as a maintainer can help make it easier for large organisations to pay you.Firstly, lots of OSS doesn't have a well defined owner; so who gets the money?I'm not saying that every little library you create needs to be published by a registered company, nor am I suggesting that you should remove your anonymity. But Governments and other organisations need to know  they are funding and  the money is going. The danger of accidentally funnelling money to a sanctioned state or person is just too big a risk for most organisations.If you want to receive funding - make it  clear who you are.Even when there is an owner, there often isn't an easy mechanism for paying people. Donation sites like GitHub Sponsors, Ko-Fi, and Patreon are great for individuals who want to throw a small amount of money to creators but they can be problematic for larger organisations.  Many OSS projects get around this by offering support contracts. It makes it much easier for an organisation to justify their spend because they're no longer donating to something which can be obtained for free; they're paying for a service.This doesn't have to be a contract offering a 24/7 response and guaranteed SLA. It can be as simple as offering best-effort email support.The important thing is to offer an  way for a larger organisation to buy your services. Many organisations have corporate credit cards for lower-cost discretionary spending which doesn't require a full business-case.  How easily could a manager buy a £500 support contact from your site?Maintainers don't only have to offer support contracts. Many choose to offer training packages which are a good way to raise money  get more people using your product. Some project maintainers will speak at your conference for a suitable fee.Again, the aim here is for maintainers to offer a  reason for a payment to be made.Open Source has a brilliant culture of allowing multiple (often anonymous) contributors. That's fine when there's no money involved, but how does a moderately sized project decide who receives what share of the funding? Services like OpenCollective can make it easier to show  the money is going but it is better to discuss in advance with all contributors what they expect as a share.If people think they're being taken advantage of, or that a project maintainer is unjustly enriching themselves, it can cause arguments.  Be very clear to contributors what the funding is for and whether they're entitled to any of it.Finally, we faced the issue that some OSS projects didn't  to take money from the "big bad state". They were worried that if people saw "Sponsored by the Government" they would assume that there were backdoors for spies, or that the developer might give in to pressure to add unwanted features.  This (usually) isn't the case but it is easy to see why having a single large organisation as the main donor could give the impression of impropriety.The best defence against this is to have  of paying sponsors! Having the state as one of many partners makes it clear that a project isn't beholden to any one customer.It isn't impossible to get Governments to spend on Open Source. But state spending is heavily scrutinised and, bluntly, they aren't set up to pay  amounts to non-suppliers, who aren't charging money.  While large projects often have the resources to apply for Government grants and contracts, smaller projects rarely have the time or expertise. It is critical that maintainers remove the barriers which make it too hard for organisations to pay them.Make it easy for Governments and other large organisations to pay you.Be as obvious as possible that you are able to accept payments from them.Don't be afraid to put a large price on your talents.Offer multiple paid-for options like speaker fees, support, and feature development funding.Talk with your contributors to let them know how any funding will be shared.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Empowering Flink CDC: Schema Evolution Support Lands in Apache SeaTunnel</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/empowering-flink-cdc-schema-evolution-support-lands-in-apache-seatunnel?source=rss</link><author>William Guo</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 07:08:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From classroom to codebase!

Fortune 500 CEOs, hypnotized by NVIDIA’s stock price and OpenAI’s demos, write checks their companies can’t cash. That red line? That’s $500 billion annually achieving -45% ROI (Return on Investment — how much you get back compared to what you spend). Not a typo.  forty-five percent. Companies are paying premium prices to make  decisions . It’s like hiring McKinsey to tell you what you already know, except McKinsey occasionally delivers positive value. Nobody admits failure. The AI system becomes “strategic infrastructure.” The losses get buried in “digital transformation.” The vendors — , the whole choir — keep singing about the future while cashing checks in the present.Remember the California Gold Rush from the history books? You know who got rich in 1849. Not the miners. The pickaxe sellers.==Today’s pickaxe merchants sell GPU clusters and API tokens to CEOs panning for digital gold.== They whisper sweet promises: “AI will revolutionize your business.” What they don’t mention is that graph showing AI never achieves positive ROI for operational decisions.Instead they boast about having more billion parameters than the competition’s AI monster. Of course theirs is bigger, more insanely convoluted — an expanding minefield of compounding errors,  each cascade multiplying the disaster.Meanwhile, see that green line in the chart above — simple algorithms from 1913 — keeps printing money at 1200% ROI. But nobody’s selling conferences about the Economic Order Quantity formula. There’s no TED talk about Little’s Law and the other older algorithms.Yep, unfortunately you can’t raise billions in funding rounds by selling an algorithm that fits on a napkin from that expensive restaurant where you’re shaking hands with investors interested in a bigger AI beast.🤔The tragedy is more nuanced than AI sellers admit — and more complex than CEOs with their broken quarterly-profit-maximization algorithms want to hear.Yes, there’s a hybrid approach where AI becomes just one component alongside those ancient algorithms when complexity grows. But that requires two things the AI revolution explicitly avoids:==First, you need to understand your business== ==from the molecular level to the stratosphere — every intricacy of your model, what you’re actually selling versus what you think you’re selling, where costs hide, where value emerges. These insights come from human minds. AI won’t solve what you can’t articulate, despite the sales pitch.====Second, you need to hire and respect professional====s who combine programming excellence with mathematical rigor and the rare ability to translate both into business value. But your AI recruiting system will never surface these people.== It’s optimized for commodities, not talent — screening for keywords, not capability.Look at the carnage in the table below (Chart 3) . This isn’t speculation — it’s documented history: Running on a decision that fits on an index card. Investment: approximately zero. Return: Industry dominance for four decades. The crown jewel of . Investment: $4 billion. Return: Sold for parts at a 95% loss. One simple rule about load factors. Still the only major US airline to avoid bankruptcy. Cutting-edge AI pricing models. Burned $500 million in one quarter before shutting down entirely.The only success story with AI? Amazon’s hybrid approach — yup, not pure AI, it’s old-school EOQ with some ML sprinkled on top when absolutely necessary. Even then, the ROI is a fraction of what simple algorithms achieve alone.But let’s be honest here, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater: when your business complexity genuinely grows — meaning the actual number of variables you must account for — you need more flexibility. That might be AI/ML, or more likely, it’s just good programmers who understand your business and can architect the math you actually need.Here’s what 20 years in the trenches taught most of us: around 90% of “complex” business problems can be solved by a competent programmer with decent math skills and simple algorithms, properly wired together.Occam’s Razor still cuts: The simplest solution that works is usually right.==But simplicity doesn’t sell conference tickets. Simplicity doesn’t raise Series B funding. Simplicity doesn’t get you on the cover of Wired. 😂==So instead, companies take the lazy, prestigious route: throw their problems at whatever AI the vendors are pushing this quarter. It’s like hiring a top surgeon to apply a Band-Aid — expensive, unnecessary, and probably going to make things worse.The real tragedy? That competent programmer with the simple solution costs $150K/year. The AI system that fails costs $15M. But the programmer doesn’t come with a sales team, a PowerPoint deck, or a promise to “transform your digital future.”Guess which one the board approves.The Seven Heroes of Business HistoryOur position shouldn’t surprise you by now, dear reader. We’re betting on what’s worked brilliantly for decades through every crisis, disaster, and market shift while delivering massive profits: The formula is simple: Hire, value, and respect your best asset — . Add modern cloud infrastructure and, when genuinely appropriate (maybe 5–10% of cases), deploy the hybrid Algorithm + AI/ML approach.But let’s be clear: forget the magic they’re selling — the fantasy of throwing data at AI and getting perfect solutions every time. That’s not happening.Yes, LLMs are useful as search tools, data navigators, even coding assistants. But they’re far from autonomous. In non-trivial cases, you need spend lot of time cross-referencing to catch their false positives and, worse, the errors nobody notices —  that spaghettify and collide concepts into dangerous nonsense.Meet the Magnificent SevenMore than 500 years of combined service. Trillions in value created. Under 1K lines of code total.Look at this table (Chart 4). These seven algorithms have never failed. For decades — in some cases over a century — they’ve consistently delivered business value to most of mankind. The epitome of simplicity.\
Each one is a specialist with embarrassingly simple code:EOQ (1913): The inventory gunslinger - Square root of (2 × demand × order cost / holding cost). One line. Tells you exactly how much to order.DuPont (1920): The financial sharpshooter - ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Leverage. Three numbers multiplied. Instant diagnosis of what’s broken.Newsvendor (1950s): The perishables ranger - Order up to the point where the  matches the cost of running short vs. overstocking. A single threshold for “how much to make.”Kelly (1956): The risk-sizing marshal - Bet a fraction of your bankroll based on  — when your advantage is bigger, size up; when it’s small, size down. Never overbet.CPM (1957): The project management tracker - Find the longest path through your network. That’s your deadline. Everything else can slip; this can’t.Little’s Law (1961): The operations enforcer - Items in system = arrival rate × time in system. It’s physics, not statistics. Works for everything.PageRank (1998): The young gun who built an empire - A page’s importance is the sum of votes from important pages, each vote , with a small  factor to keep it stable. Keep iterating. Built Google.Total code for all seven: comfortably <1K lines. The math that runs the world fits in a single GitHub gist.Is a programming career still viable? Looking at this table — absolutely. Learning algorithms and programming built the past and will build the future, despite this transient AI-hypnotized present.The AI hype has its place — pattern finding, searching, identifying. But it needs years of improvement to correct its statistical errors from Type I through IV. Even then, algorithms in the hands of competent developers remain irreplaceable and far from commodities. While everyone chases AI complexity, these seven simple formulas keep generating thousands of percent returns. They don’t need updates. They don’t hallucinate. They just work.That’s not outdated. That’s immortal. Let’s keep programming with algorithms while the true researchers work on fixing AI errors with better math.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpaceX: Starship Will Be Going To the Moon, With Or Without NASA</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/0045236/spacex-starship-will-be-going-to-the-moon-with-or-without-nasa?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[schwit1 shares a report from Behind the Black: SpaceX is going to land this spaceship manned on the Moon, whether or not NASA's SLS and Orion are ready. And even if those expensive, cumbersome, and poorly designed boondoggles are ready for those first two Artemis landings, SpaceX is likely to quickly outmatch them with numerous other private missions to the Moon, outside of NASA. It has the funds to do it, and it knows it has the customers willing to buy the flights. The news comes from a detailed update SpaceX released today on the Starship lunar lander. Here's the section where SpaceX "made it clear that it sees Starship and Superheavy as its own space effort, irrelevant of NASA": "To return Americans to the Moon, SpaceX aligned Starship development along two paths: development of the core Starship system and supporting infrastructure, including production facilities, test facilities, and launch sites -- which SpaceX is self-funding representing over 90% of system costs -- and development of the HLS-specific Starship configuration, which leverages and modifies the core vehicle capability to support NASA's requirements for landing crew on and returning them from the Moon. SpaceX is working under a fixed-price contract with NASA, ensuring that the company is only paid after the successful completion of progress milestones, and American taxpayers are not on the hook for increased SpaceX costs. SpaceX provides significant insight to NASA at every stage of the development process along both paths, including access to flight data from missions not funded under the HLS contract.
 
Both pathways are necessary and made possible by SpaceX's substantial self-investments to enable the high-rate production, launch, and test of Starship for missions to the Moon and other purposes. Starship will bring the United States back to the Moon before any other nation and it will enable sustainable lunar operations by being fully and rapidly reusable, cost-effective, and capable of high frequency lunar missions with more than 100 tons of cargo capacity."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Road to Hell is Paved with Good DRY Intentions</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-dry-intentions?source=rss</link><author>Melvin Kosisochukwu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:53:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have come across my share of beautifully written, over-engineered code… one moment I am thinking “That is an interesting way to do that” and the next minute you are wondering “what the hell is going on here!”. I have also suffered from writing over-engineered code, where you are thinking so far into the future that you compromise . The  (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) principle is a good way to counter over-engineering: functionalities should only be implemented when you need them, not on the possibility that you will need them. I have mentioned over-engineering a couple of times now, and some of you reading this are probably thinking What is over-engineering?In very simple terms, over-engineering is making software/system design more complex than necessary; this usually happens because you want to add extra functionality to your component to simplify the implementation of A, only to add the functionality for B later.We have this codebase for managing invitations; it’s an inherited, legacy codebase with technical debt that accrues interest. The more you try to work on the legacy code, the more something somewhere else breaks. You have to revert in most cases and start all over. Working around the legacy code ends up accruing interest on the technical debt; it’s a standoff between risking breaking features all over the app or adding more technical debt to the codebase. The third solution we came up with was abstraction. We had to figure out ways to modularise new features or improvements to the application, and to expose and share data where necessary. At first, this seemed like a Hail Mary. Finally, we can work on this mangled codebase with minimal side effects. Were we wrong!! The abstraction spiraled, and the codebase ended up overabstracted, bloating the solution to the problem and bringing the supposed salvaged side of the codebase into its own hell. Along the line, we forgone the rules for the abstraction and now have different parts of the application dependent on each other, looping back to where we started. I suppose this was bound to happen in a codebase with a couple of developers, each with fire up their asses to ship features; we ended up shipping maintenance and more technical debt.When collaborating with multiple people on a codebase (which is pretty much always the case), and for corporates who are more interested in shipping features than code quality, code reviews always suffer. For problems like over-engineering and overabstraction, Traditional line-by-line code reviews often miss these systematic issues. You check a component created a couple of weeks ago to support the integration of a feature, following the DRY principle, and realize there are now 10 interconnected/similar features that depend on the component. Code reviews will need to be elevated to catch these architectural issues and ensure that dependency requirements between components are met.We live by the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) gospel because it simplifies work, and developers are inherently lazy (in a good way). The DRY principle works well with orthogonal systems: small, self-contained components combined to form a system.Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which implements functionality independent of each other.There should be more emphasis on orthogonal systems and on DRY code; it’s easier to combine the reusable functions you create with each other and scale them as the repository progresses when they are not bloated and overabstracted, at which point you end up with a rigid system interwoven so much with each other that it will be complicated to connect which aspects of the code that does not meet an exact rule, you will find yourself duplicating the code because making it work for a new connection breaks an old system. Congratulations, you have achieved Spaghetti code that cannot bend. To use a truly orthogonal system and avoid spaghetti DRY code, every code module change should affect only the module that is updated.Your components should not focus solely on avoiding repetition, but also on being small abstractions of the overall system; otherwise, you will end up with components so complex that they can easily break with a single change to a connected component. When creating reusable code, the approach should be writing code that does not depend on any other code block to function a certain way. Reusability should be used as a tool and not the goal; when you have reusable UI components with business or API logic in the same component, you are on a highway to over-abstraction. It starts small, and before you realize what is happening, the disease has festered throughout your repository. Now you cannot reuse the component on a different page with the same UI functions and different logic without adding additional external logic/context to the component.Modularity Modularity ModularityModularity involves breaking your system down into smaller, independent codes/components called modules. Please pay attention to the word ‘smaller’; it’s possible to have a bloated module with more code than necessary, which creates over-abstraction and should be avoided. Over-abstraction is really just an unsuccessful attempt at modularity. Your modules should be able to function independently of other modules, only exposing required data. Changes to good, modular, structured code should affect only the modules, without any cascading effects.A good approach to building orthogonal systems and easily avoiding over-abstraction is to build with functionality first, then features; this aligns well with Component-Based architecture(separating UI components from stateful components). The functionality stage will focus on the smallest reusable units of code that are assembled to implement the feature. A Login feature will consist of the following functions: collect username and password (UI), validate user data, redirect to the user profile/reject collected user data. Each functionality should operate independently, relying only on necessary data.No medals for over-sophisticated codeAfter writing every code implementation, ask yourself whether there is an easier or simpler way to achieve the same result. Most of us have heard stories about code that can be edited or worked on by only one person in the company, which is not a feat to be proud of. Writing code that can only be maintained by you most likely means it’s over-sophisticated or employs unorthodox procedures. A great example of coding using unorthodox procedures is Gilfoyle’s Hard Drives from the article:  I have found myself writing overly sophisticated code because I want to use a new technology/package/library I just learned about, without considering whether it is the simplest tool for the job. The excitement for learning something new is great, but attention to when and where it should be applied is probably more important.In the quest for writing perfect codes that account for all possible future and time-travelling cases, you end up with an over-engineered codebase. You should give it up because it is not possible to write perfect code, aim for good enough that meets all your immediate requirements. The DRY principle is fundamental; repetition is still a sin in software development. The DRY principle should be applied to an orthogonal system to create a codebase that is decoupled, with each module independent and exchanging data at a separate meeting point(feature module). These will help you create systems that are easy to maintain and debug. Remember that simple is always better in software development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Part 1:Building Your First Video Pipeline: FFmpeg &amp; MediaMTX Basics</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/part-1building-your-first-video-pipeline-ffmpeg-and-mediamtx-basics?source=rss</link><author>Samuel Olamide</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:51:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine this: You're tasked with building a web application that displays live video feeds from security cameras, IoT devices, or webcams. Simple enough, right? You quickly discover that while HTML5 video works great for pre-recorded content, the world of real-time streaming is a maze of protocols, codecs, and compatibility issues that can turn a very "simple" feature into weeks of frustration.The core problem is interestingly simple: cameras speak RTSP, but browsers don't. Most IP cameras and professional video equipment use RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) to broadcast their feeds. That's because it's reliable, has low latency, and is perfect for direct connections. But when you try to display that same stream in a web browser, you hit a wall. Modern browsers have dropped RTSP support entirely for security reasons since around 2010-2015, leaving developers scrambling for solutions.This is where the magic happens., the Swiss Army knife of video processing, and , a modern streaming server that acts as a universal translator between different video protocols. Together, they form the backbone of countless video applications, from Netflix's encoding pipeline to your local security system's web interface.In this series, we are going to build a complete, production-ready video streaming pipeline from the ground up. By the end of this first article, you'll have a live webcam feed streaming directly in your browser with remarkably low latency. Let's dive in.FFmpeg: The Universal Video Swiss Army KnifeFFmpeg is arguably one of the most important pieces of software you've never heard of. It powers video processing in applications ranging from VLC media player to professional broadcast systems. At its core, FFmpeg is a command-line tool that can read virtually any video or audio format and convert it to virtually any other format.The FFmpeg workflow follows a predictable pattern: Separating video and audio streams from container formats Converting compressed data into raw video frames and audio samples Applying transformations like scaling, cropping, or color correction Compressing the processed data using codecs like H.264 or VP9 Packaging the encoded streams into output containersFor our streaming pipeline, FFmpeg will serve as the ingestion engine. It will capture video from sources like webcams or files, encode it efficiently, and push it to our streaming server using protocols like RTSP or RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol).While FFmpeg excels at processing video, it cannot serve multiple clients simultaneously. That's where MediaMTX comes in. MediaMTX is a modern, lightweight streaming server that acts as a universal media gateway.Think of MediaMTX as a protocol translator and traffic manager:It accepts incoming streams via RTSP, RTMP, WebRTC, or HLSIt can re-package those streams into different formats for different clientsIt handles authentication, load balancing, and client managementMost importantly for web developers, it can serve RTSP streams as WebRTC, making them accessible to browsersThe beauty of MediaMTX lies in its simplicity. A single binary with a YAML configuration file can handle complex streaming scenarios that would require multiple specialized servers in traditional setups.Before we start building, let's get our tools installed.As of the time of writing this article, the latest ffmpeg release is v8.0, and that is what I will be using.sudo apt-update
sudo apt install autoconf automake build-essential pkg-config libx264-dev libvpx-dev libfdk-aac-dev

git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg

cd ffmpeg

./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree

make -j$(nproc)

make install
On MacOS (using Homebrew):Extract the downloaded zip file to You should see folders like , , etc.Press  R, type , press EnterClick  tab → Under , find and select You should see version information and a list of supported codecs and formats.As of the time of writing this article, the latest ffmpeg release is v1.15.0, and that is what I will be using.MediaMTX distributes as a single binary, making installation straightforward:MacOS and Linux Installation:# Download and extract (replace 'linux' with 'darwin' for MacOS)
wget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/latest/download/mediamtx_v1.15.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf mediamtx_v1.15.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# Make executable and test
chmod +x mediamtx

# Add to system PATH
sudo mv mediamtx /usr/local/bin/

# Run it to confirm installation
mediamtx
# Download and extract
curl -L -O https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/latest/download/mediamtx_v1.15.0_windows_amd64.tar.gz

# Extract to mediamtx_v1.15.0_windows_amd64 folder

# Test run
cd mediamtx_v1.15.0_windows_amd64
./mediamtx.exe

# Add to PATH
mkdir C:\Users\{YOUR_USER}\bin
Move-Item .\mediamtx.exe C:\Users\{YOUR_USER}\bin\
: Windows + R → ==sysdm.cpl== → Advanced → Environment Variables → System Variables → Path → Edit → New → Add  Windows Defender may flag the download - temporarily disable if needed.When you run MediaMTX for the first time, you'll see output like:\
MediaMTX is now running and ready to accept streams.Project 1: Streaming a Video FileLet's start simple by streaming a video file. This simulates a live source and helps us understand the basic pipeline without the complexity of hardware interfaces.First, create a basic MediaMTX configuration file. Create :# Basic MediaMTX configuration
paths:
  test_video:
    source: publisher
This configuration creates a path called  that accepts published streams from any source.Run mediamtx with the config file you created:# In the directory you created the mediamtx.yml
mediamtx mediamtx.yml
Now, let's use FFmpeg to stream a video file to MediaMTX. You'll need a video file for testing. Any MP4, AVI, or MOV file will work:ffmpeg -re -i your_video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -c:a aac -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/test_video
Let's break down this command:: Read input at its native frame rate (essential for live streaming): Input file: Use H.264 video codec (widely compatible): Encoding speed vs. compression trade-off: Use AAC audio codec: Output format is RTSPrtsp://localhost:8554/test_video: Destination URLIf everything works correctly, you'll see FFmpeg output showing frame processing statistics.Open VLC Media Player and:Go to Media → Open Network StreamEnter: rtsp://localhost:8554/test_videoYou should see your video playing! This confirms that MediaMTX is receiving the stream from FFmpeg and serving it via RTSP.Project 2: Streaming a WebcamNow, let's capture something live. We'll stream directly from your webcam to create a real-time video feed.First, let's add a new path in our mediamtx config:# Basic MediaMTX configuration
paths:
  test_video:
    source: publisher
  webcam:
    source: publisher
Now we need to identify your webcam device:# List video devices
ls /dev/video*

# Usually /dev/video0 for the first webcam
# List available devices
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""
# List available devices
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy

# OR
Get-PnpDevice -Class Camera | Select-Object FriendlyName, Status
You'll see output listing available cameras and microphones. Note the device index (usually 0 for the built-in camera).Now, let's stream your webcam:ffmpeg -f dshow -rtbufsize 100M -i video="Integrated Webcam" -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam
Let's break down this command: - Use DirectShow input format (Windows-specific for cameras/microphones) - Set real-time buffer size to 100MB (prevents dropped frames)-i video="Integrated Webcam" - Input source: video device named "Integrated Webcam" - Video codec: use H.264 encoder - Encoding preset: prioritize speed over compression quality - Optimize encoding for real-time streaming (minimal buffering) - Output format: Real Time Streaming Protocolrtsp://localhost:8554/webcam - Output destination: local RTSP server on port 8554, path "/webcam"ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -video_size 1280x720 -i "0" -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam
 - Use AVFoundation input format (macOS-specific for cameras/microphones) - Capture at 30 frames per second - Set capture resolution to 1280x720 (720p) - Input source: device index 0 (first camera device) (same as Windows) - Video codec: H.264 encoder - Fastest encoding preset - Real-time streaming optimization - RTSP output formatrtsp://localhost:8554/webcam - RTSP server destinationffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -c:a aac -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam
 - Use Video4Linux2 input format (Linux-specific for cameras) - Input source: first video device in Linux (/dev/video0) - Video codec: H.264 encoder - Fastest encoding preset - Real-time streaming optimization - Audio codec: Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) - RTSP output formatrtsp://localhost:8554/webcam - RTSP server destination We're using the path  instead of . Test this stream in VLC using rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam. You should see your live webcam feed with minimal delay!Project 3: The Magic of WebRTCHere's where things get exciting. While RTSP works great for applications like VLC, it won't work in web browsers. But MediaMTX has a superpower: it can automatically convert RTSP streams to WebRTC, which browsers understand perfectly.Let's enable WebRTC in MediaMTX. Update your  configuration:# Basic MediaMTX configuration
webrtc: yes
webrtcAddress: :8889
webrtcEncryption: no
webrtcAllowOrigin: '*'
webrtcLocalUDPAddress: :8189
webrtcIPsFromInterfaces: yes

paths:
  test_video:
    source: publisher
  webcam:
    source: publisher
Restart MediaMTX with this new configuration and keep your webcam stream running with FFmpeg. Open your browser to http://localhost:8889/webcam. Your webcam feed should start playing directly in the browser.This is the magic moment. You've just built a complete real-time video pipeline that captures live video, processes it, and delivers it to web browsers using modern WebRTC technology. The same architecture powers professional applications serving thousands of concurrent viewers.Understanding What Just HappenedLet's trace the complete data flow:Your webcam produces raw video framesFFmpeg captures these frames, encodes them as H.264, and streams them via RTSP to MediaMTXMediaMTX receives the RTSP stream and makes it available on the  pathWhen a browser requests the stream via WebRTC, MediaMTX automatically converts the RTSP stream to WebRTC formatThe browser receives WebRTC packets and renders them in real-timeThis pipeline is remarkably efficient because MediaMTX doesn't re-encode the video. It simply repackages the H.264 stream into different container formats for different protocols.You've just built a foundational real-time video streaming pipeline. Let's recap what you've accomplished:Installed and configured FFmpeg and MediaMTXStreamed a pre-recorded video file to simulate live contentCaptured and streamed live video from your webcamEnabled browser-based viewing using WebRTCCreated a low-latency video pipeline suitable for interactive applicationsThis setup demonstrates the core concepts that power much larger streaming systems. The same pattern (capture, encode, serve) scales from single streams to thousands of concurrent feeds.However, our current setup has some limitations that prevent it from being production-ready:No authentication or security measuresCan't handle real-world video sources like IP camerasNo monitoring or error handlingIn Part 2, we'll address these challenges by securing our pipeline, connecting to real IP cameras, and preparing our system for internet deployment. We'll explore authentication mechanisms, handle diverse video formats, and transform our localhost demo into a robust, secure streaming service.The journey from "works on my machine" to "production-ready" is where the real engineering challenges begin and where the most interesting solutions emerge.Ready to take your streaming pipeline to the next level? Continue with Part 2: Beyond Localhost: Security, Authentication, and Real-World Sources where we'll secure our setup and connect to real-world video sources.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The MVP Engineering Playbook: Ship a Useful 0→1 in 6 Weeks</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-mvp-engineering-playbook-ship-a-useful-01-in-6-weeks?source=rss</link><author>Abidhusain Chidi</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:46:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A practical scope, sprint, and CI/CD blueprint any small team can copy.Most MVPs fail from scope creep, fragile infrastructure, or slow feedback loops—not from lack of ideas.

Remember your first Go code? It probably had dozens of  checks and 200-line functions that did everything at once. After analyzing over 50 Go projects, I've identified the main beginner problem: they write Go like Java or Python, ignoring the language's idioms.Common function problems I've seen:Functions over 100 lines: ~40% of codebasesMixed responsibilities: ~60% of functionsPoor error handling: ~30% of bugsMissing defer for cleanup: ~45% of resource leaksIn this article — the first in a Clean Code in Go series — we'll explore how to write functions you won't be ashamed to show in code review. We'll discuss the single responsibility principle, error handling, and why  is your best friend.Single Responsibility Principle: One Function — One JobHere's a typical function from a real project (names changed):// BAD: monster function does everything
func ProcessUserData(userID int) (*User, error) {
    // Validation
    if userID <= 0 {
        log.Printf("Invalid user ID: %d", userID)
        return nil, errors.New("invalid user ID")
    }

    // Database connection
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connString)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("DB connection failed: %v", err)
        return nil, err
    }
    defer db.Close()

    var user User
    err = db.QueryRow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", userID).Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name, &user.Email)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Query failed: %v", err)
        return nil, err
    }

    // Data enrichment
    if user.Email != "" {
        domain := strings.Split(user.Email, "@")[1]
        user.EmailDomain = domain

        // Check corporate domain
        corporateDomains := []string{"google.com", "microsoft.com", "apple.com"}
        for _, corp := range corporateDomains {
            if domain == corp {
                user.IsCorporate = true
                break
            }
        }
    }

    // Logging
    log.Printf("User %d processed successfully", userID)

    return &user, nil
}
This function violates SRP on multiple fronts:Manages database connections: A function should fit entirely on a developer's screen (roughly 30-50 lines). If you need to scroll — time to refactor.Let's refactor following Go idioms:// GOOD: each function has one responsibility
func GetUser(ctx context.Context, userID int) (*User, error) {
    if err := validateUserID(userID); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
    }

    user, err := fetchUserFromDB(ctx, userID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("fetch user %d: %w", userID, err)
    }

    enrichUserData(user)
    return user, nil
}

func validateUserID(id int) error {
    if id <= 0 {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid user ID: %d", id)
    }
    return nil
}

func fetchUserFromDB(ctx context.Context, userID int) (*User, error) {
    row := db.QueryRowContext(ctx, `
        SELECT id, name, email 
        FROM users 
        WHERE id = $1`, userID)

    var user User
    if err := row.Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name, &user.Email); err != nil {
        if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {
            return nil, ErrUserNotFound
        }
        return nil, err
    }

    return &user, nil
}

func enrichUserData(user *User) {
    if user.Email == "" {
        return
    }

    parts := strings.Split(user.Email, "@")
    if len(parts) != 2 {
        return
    }

    user.EmailDomain = parts[1]
    user.IsCorporate = isCorporateDomain(user.EmailDomain)
}
 (20 lines max)Has single responsibilityCan be tested independentlyError Handling: The Go WayBeginners often create the "pyramid of doom":// BAD: deep nesting
func SendNotification(userID int, message string) error {
    user, err := GetUser(userID)
    if err == nil {
        if user.Email != "" {
            if user.IsActive {
                if user.NotificationsEnabled {
                    err := smtp.Send(user.Email, message)
                    if err == nil {
                        log.Printf("Sent to %s", user.Email)
                        return nil
                    } else {
                        log.Printf("Failed to send: %v", err)
                        return err
                    }
                } else {
                    return errors.New("notifications disabled")
                }
            } else {
                return errors.New("user inactive")
            }
        } else {
            return errors.New("email empty")
        }
    } else {
        return fmt.Errorf("user not found: %v", err)
    }
}
Solution: Early Return (Guard Clauses)// GOOD: early return on errors
func SendNotification(userID int, message string) error {
    user, err := GetUser(userID)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("get user %d: %w", userID, err)
    }

    if user.Email == "" {
        return ErrEmptyEmail
    }

    if !user.IsActive {
        return ErrUserInactive
    }

    if !user.NotificationsEnabled {
        return ErrNotificationsDisabled
    }

    if err := smtp.Send(user.Email, message); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("send to %s: %w", user.Email, err)
    }

    log.Printf("Notification sent to %s", user.Email)
    return nil
}
Error Wrapping: Context MattersSince Go 1.13,  with the  verb wraps errors. Always use it:// Define sentinel errors for business logic
var (
    ErrUserNotFound          = errors.New("user not found")
    ErrInsufficientFunds     = errors.New("insufficient funds")
    ErrOrderAlreadyProcessed = errors.New("order already processed")
)

func ProcessPayment(orderID string) error {
    order, err := fetchOrder(orderID)
    if err != nil {
        // Add context to the error
        return fmt.Errorf("process payment for order %s: %w", orderID, err)
    }

    if order.Status == "processed" {
        return ErrOrderAlreadyProcessed
    }

    if err := chargeCard(order); err != nil {
        // Wrap technical errors
        return fmt.Errorf("charge card for order %s: %w", orderID, err)
    }

    return nil
}

// Calling code can check error type
if err := ProcessPayment("ORD-123"); err != nil {
    if errors.Is(err, ErrOrderAlreadyProcessed) {
        // Business logic for already processed order
        return nil
    }

    if errors.Is(err, ErrInsufficientFunds) {
        // Notify user about insufficient funds
        notifyUser(err)
    }

    // Log unexpected errors
    log.Printf("Payment failed: %v", err)
    return err
}
Defer: Guaranteed Resource Cleanup is one of Go's killer features. Use it for guaranteed cleanup:// BAD: might forget to release resources
func ReadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(path)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    data, err := io.ReadAll(file)
    if err != nil {
        file.Close() // Easy to forget during refactoring
        return nil, err
    }

    var config Config
    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &config); err != nil {
        file.Close() // Duplication
        return nil, err
    }

    file.Close() // And again
    return &config, nil
}
// GOOD: defer guarantees closure
func ReadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(path)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("open config %s: %w", path, err)
    }
    defer file.Close() // Will execute no matter what

    data, err := io.ReadAll(file)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("read config %s: %w", path, err)
    }

    var config Config
    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &config); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("parse config %s: %w", path, err)
    }

    return &config, nil
}
Pattern: Cleanup Functionsfunc WithTransaction(ctx context.Context, fn func(*sql.Tx) error) error {
    tx, err := db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("begin transaction: %w", err)
    }

    // defer executes in LIFO order
    defer func() {
        if p := recover(); p != nil {
            tx.Rollback()
            panic(p) // re-throw panic after cleanup
        }

        if err != nil {
            tx.Rollback()
        } else {
            err = tx.Commit()
        }
    }()

    err = fn(tx)
    return err
}

// Usage
err := WithTransaction(ctx, func(tx *sql.Tx) error {
    // All logic in transaction
    // Rollback/Commit happens automatically
    return nil
})
// BAD: unclear purpose
func Process(data []byte) error
func Handle(r Request) Response
func Do() error

// GOOD: verb + noun
func ParseJSON(data []byte) (*Config, error)
func ValidateEmail(email string) error
func SendNotification(user *User, msg string) error
If more than 3-4 parameters — use a struct:// BAD: too many parameters
func CreateUser(name, email, phone, address string, age int, isActive bool) (*User, error)

// GOOD: group into struct
type CreateUserRequest struct {
    Name     string
    Email    string
    Phone    string
    Address  string
    Age      int
    IsActive bool
}

func CreateUser(req CreateUserRequest) (*User, error)
// BAD: boolean flags are unclear
func CheckPermission(userID int) (bool, bool, error) // what does first bool mean? second?

// GOOD: use named returns or struct
func CheckPermission(userID int) (canRead, canWrite bool, err error)

// BETTER: struct for complex results
type Permissions struct {
    CanRead   bool
    CanWrite  bool
    CanDelete bool
}

func CheckPermission(userID int) (*Permissions, error)

In reality, culture is a living, breathing force – the lifeblood of a company. It’s shaped most intensely by the  and the first handful of hires. I learned this the hard way: if you mess up culture in the first 10–20 people, everything else will suffer. A strong culture can propel a startup through challenges, while a weak or toxic culture can sink it before it scales. As Tony Hsieh of Zappos famously put it, “If you get the culture right, most of the other stuff will just happen on its own.” In this article, I’ll share lessons from my journey as a founder on building culture and practicing leadership that scales.Founder’s Behavior Sets the ToneI always start with  The founder’s behavior sets the example that everyone in the company will follow, consciously or not. How I respond under pressure, how I celebrate wins, or how I handle failures, all of it becomes a model for the team. You can write nice values on paper, but if your team sees the founder acting against those values, the words mean nothing. Leaders must  they want to see. Research confirms this: employees who trust their leaders (because leaders walk the talk) have higher job satisfaction and commitment. Jack Welch once said, “Trust happens when leaders are transparent.” Being open and honest as a leader builds credibility. If I stay calm during a crisis, ask for help when needed, or admit mistakes, I signal that these behaviors are part of our culture. Every decision and action from the top trickles down.Hiring Early Team Members WiselyIn an early-stage startup, every hire is critical. The cliche “hire A-players” exists for a reason. Those first 10–20 people define your startup’s DNA. One wrong hire with a toxic attitude can undo months of hard work and poison the well. I call it the “one wolf can kill a hundred sheep” problem – one toxic person can destroy a positive team of dozens. This isn’t just anecdotal. A Harvard study found that avoiding a single toxic employee can save a company  as much money as hiring a superstar performer, once you factor in the damage toxic workers do to morale and productivity. In other words, one bad apple truly can spoil the bunch.That’s why I personally interview almost everyone we hire in the early days. I look beyond skills and resume bullet points – I probe for attitude, adaptability, and cultural fit. One of my guiding principles: “hire for character and potential, train for skill.” You can teach someone to code in a new language, but you can’t easily teach humility, resilience, or integrity. Other founders echo this: . As investor Krishna Rangasayee notes, technical chops matter, but “at the end of the day, you can teach skills… What you can't teach is how to fit into a culture.” We prioritize candidates who align with our values and mission. Some people might look “average” on paper but have incredible growth potential and attitude – those are often the gems. Conversely, I’ve seen people with shiny CVs who brought subtle toxicity or ego that eroded teamwork.  if you must, but get those first hires right. It sets the foundation for everything. And if someone toxic does slip through, remove them quickly – the cost of keeping them is far higher than the cost of an empty seat.Transparent Leadership and TrustLeadership is about more than giving orders; it’s about . I’ve learned to be brutally transparent with my team about what’s happening, even when the news isn’t good. If revenue is down or a product launch fails, everyone knows the numbers and the situation. Why? Because people are smart – they will spot lies or half-truths a mile away, and nothing erodes trust faster than a feeling that leadership is hiding something. Conversely, honesty (even when uncomfortable) builds trust faster than any sugarcoating.In our company, we practice open communication about wins and losses. When we miss a target, I explain why and what we’ll do next. When we land a big client, I share the details and credit the team. This creates a culture where news – good or bad – isn’t a taboo but something we tackle together. The payoff is a team that trusts leadership and feels invested. There’s research to back this up: employees who trust their leader are more committed and less likely to quit. Transparency is indeed a lifeline, especially as we embraced remote work (more on that soon). We’ve adopted rituals like weekly all-hands video calls, monthly updates on key metrics, and an open dashboard of our KPIs. By providing context and explaining decisions, I empower team members to make better choices on their own. In short, transparency breeds accountability and unity. It shows respect for your team’s intelligence and creates a shared reality where everyone is pulling in the same direction.Control vs. Empowerment: Real LeadershipMany first-time founders (my past self included) confuse  with leadership. It’s tempting to micromanage every detail, thinking that if you’re involved in everything, nothing can go wrong. But true leadership is often the opposite: letting people own their work and stepping in only where you add value. Micromanagement is a trap that kills ownership and signals a lack of trust. It might satisfy your inner control freak, but it will demoralize your team and slow you down. As our company grew, I had to learn to stop steering every wheel and instead guide the ship by setting direction and context.When you micromanage, you send a message that you don’t trust your team’s judgment. Over time, employees become disengaged and dependent, or they leave. Studies highlight this contrast: “Micromanagement kills ownership and promotes a lack of trust. In contrast, empowerment cultivates a culture of trust [and] energizes initiative.”. I experienced this firsthand. Early on, I was reviewing every piece of code, every marketing blurb. Eventually, I realized I was smothering the very talented people I hired. So I shifted: I set clear expectations and let them figure out  to meet them. I focused on providing support and removing roadblocks rather than doing their jobs. The transformation was immediate – people took , productivity soared, and I was less stressed.Leadership is not about commanding every move but enabling your team to make the right moves. This is even more true with experienced senior hires – they . Give it to them and they’ll amaze you; stifle them and you’ll lose them.The Challenges of Remote, Cross-Border TeamsOur startup is fully remote and globally distributed, which adds another layer of leadership challenge. When your team is spread across cities and time zones, you lose the casual office chatter and nuance of face-to-face interactions. Culture doesn’t form around a ping-pong table or free lunch – you have to  in a remote setting. We discovered that  is key. In a co-located office, a new development might spread via hallway conversations; remotely, nothing spreads unless you communicate it. So we established rituals and systems to keep everyone aligned and connected.Some practices that worked for us: daily stand-up check-ins in a chat channel, weekly written summaries of what each team accomplished, virtual “demo days” to show off work, and non-work social calls (yes, even a remote team can have a coffee break together on Zoom). These rituals give shape to our weeks and reinforce our values. Team rituals can foster a sense of belonging and glue a remote team together. For example, every Friday we have a casual video call where we share one success, one challenge, and often a fun personal update. It sounds simple, but these little traditions create camaraderie.In cross-border teams, you have different cultures – some folks are very direct, others more indirect. Miscommunications happen easily. To counter this, we wrote down guidelines for how we collaborate: for instance,  in messages (since text can seem curt without tone), and “Don’t confuse silence with agreement” (encouraging people to speak up). We encourage : if something is important, put it in writing and ensure everyone sees it (we use shared docs and Slack channels instead of siloed DMs whenever possible). One quote from a remote-work expert stuck with me: “Effective and open communication is absolutely crucial in a remote team. Without it, everything falls apart.”. We took that to heart by making transparency our default. Almost all conversations and decisions happen in the open.Balancing Perfectionism with SpeedConfession: I used to be a perfectionist founder. I obsessed over tiny details – pixel-perfect UI spacing, every comma in a blog post, the exact shade of button colors. High standards are valuable, especially when you’re crafting a product, but perfectionism can become a double-edged sword. In a startup,  is often more critical than getting everything 100% perfect. If you wait for perfection, you might miss the market or let competitors overtake you. I had to learn to balance my perfectionist tendencies with the necessity of rapid iteration and innovation. So now, instead of polishing every detail endlessly, we aim for “very good” and then launch and learn. We still value quality – our culture is ambitious about excellence, but we’ve embraced a mantra of .This was a tough personal growth area for me. Perfectionism often comes from fear – fear of failure or looking foolish. But a culture overly afraid of mistakes is a culture that . I intentionally encourage my team (and myself) to experiment and accept that some things will fail. We even celebrate failures in a way, by conducting blameless post-mortems and sharing lessons learned. It’s about continuous improvement. As long as we maintain high integrity and fix critical bugs fast, a typo or a suboptimal feature is not the end of the world. Far worse is a culture where people are too scared to take initiative or where product iterations grind to a halt because someone upstairs insists on pixel-perfection.Technical Skills vs. Soft Skills in LeadershipAnother hard lesson: technical expertise alone doesn’t make a founder a good leader. Many startup founders are technical geniuses – they know their product and codebase inside out. That was me; I initially felt my job was to be the smartest person in the room. But I learned that being the smartest coder or best product architect doesn’t automatically translate to leading a team. In fact, overly technical founders can fall into the trap of dominating discussions, dismissing others’ ideas, or doing things themselves instead of teaching others. True leadership requires : communication, empathy, listening, and the ability to inspire and develop others.There’s plenty of evidence that  and people skills matter more than IQ in leadership roles. A CareerBuilder survey of hiring managers found 71% of employers value emotional intelligence more than pure IQ or technical skill in employees. Most said they’d even  a technically brilliant candidate if they lacked people skills, and 75% said they’re more likely to promote someone with high EQ over high IQ. Why? Because leadership is fundamentally about people. You manage things, but you . If you can’t relate, motivate, and adapt to your team’s needs, your technical knowledge won’t save you.I had to pivot from being a hands-on tech contributor to a . I still use my technical knowledge – but now it’s to ask the right questions in design reviews, to mentor junior engineers, or to set a high-level technical vision. The goal is to empower others with my knowledge, not to use it to win every argument or make every decision. In fact, Google’s famous Project Oxygen study on management found that among the top traits of great managers were being a good coach, empowering the team, expressing interest in team members’ success, etc., while technical skill ranked much lower down the list. The best technical leaders I’ve seen use their expertise to , not to belittle or micromanage. They are quick to admit when someone else knows more in a domain, showing .Leadership in a 5-person startup looks very different from leadership in a 50-person or 500-person company. Early on, as a founder, you wear all the hats – you’re involved in every decision from product design to hiring to setting up the office Wi-Fi. But if things go well, you reach a point where that’s not sustainable (and you become a bottleneck if you try). The role of the founder-CEO . I went through this transition: from a do-everything entrepreneur to a more process-oriented leader who works  the business rather than  the business.In the earliest stage (1–10 people), I found it effective to be very hands-on. It was about survival and rapid iteration, so having the founder deeply involved everywhere made sense. But once we had team leads and a bit of structure, I had to step back and . I stopped attending every meeting and focused on creating the  for others to succeed. This meant establishing an operating system for the company – things like goal-setting, OKRs, clear org charts and responsibilities, communication cadences, and cultural norms and then letting those systems run with occasional tweaks. In essence, my job shifted to  that builds the product, instead of directly building the product myself.This can be a tough shift for founders (it certainly was for me) because it feels like letting go of your “baby.” But letting go, done right, is incredibly empowering for your team and freeing for you. As one Entrepreneur article headline put it: “Letting go of control was the hardest — and smartest — move I ever made.” The author noted that delegating and sharing ownership built trust, boosted creativity, and empowered the team. I experienced the same. The more I let talented people take charge of their domains, the more innovation bubbled up without my intervention. Delegation also freed up my time to focus on long-term strategy, fundraising, and big partnerships – the things a CEO  be doing to unlock the next level of growth.Finally, a bit of heartfelt advice to fellow and future founders: build a company culture you’d be proud of even if the venture fails. Startups are risky – not all succeed in terms of product-market fit or profit. But no matter what happens, the culture you create is a legacy in its own right. If you foster an environment of learning, respect, and passion, that will impact people’s careers and lives positively, far beyond the lifespan of the startup. I’ve had employees tell me that working at our startup – even during rocky times – was the most growthful period of their careers because of the culture we cultivated. That means more to me than any revenue milestone.Culture is . It survives pivots, market crashes, and even company failures. Conversely, a toxic culture can destroy a company at its peak. So treat culture as your most precious asset. It’s not a fluffy HR thing; it’s arguably  important than your product strategy. If your only goal as a founder is to flip a quick profit, you might be tempted to cut corners – hire that brilliant jerk, tolerate a bad behavior because someone is “critical,” chase a revenue opportunity that violates your values, and one day you wake up hating the company you’ve created (and likely, your team will too). I strongly believe . One wrong hire or ethical lapse for short-term gain can torpedo everything. Profit is important (you need a sustainable business), but profit will come  of a strong culture that delivers great products and services. It shouldn’t come  of culture.So make choices you can be proud of. Define success in cultural terms, not just financial ones. For me, a win is when I see team members solving problems together without me, or when a new hire says, “I’ve never been in a workplace this open and motivating,” or when our alumni go on to spread our cultural values in other companies. Those things indicate we built something  And ironically, a healthy culture tends to lead to better business outcomes anyway – engaged, happy teams build better products and give better customer service. There’s data on this as well: companies with healthy cultures have lower turnover and higher performance. A toxic culture, on the other hand,  companies billions in turnover and disengagement.Focus on culture as much as your product. Culture is what remains when products pivot and strategies change. It’s in every decision, every conversation, every email, every hire, every celebration of a win, and every post-mortem of a failure. It’s how your company  from the inside, and how that radiates to customers and partners on the outside. As a founder, you are the initial architect of this culture. Invest in it mightily. If you do it right, your startup will not only have a better chance of success but be the kind of company you’re proud to lead, and others are proud to work for, no matter what the outcome.Key Takeaways for First-Time FoundersYour behavior sets the cultural tone. Embody the values you preach, especially under pressure. Trust and transparency from leadership foster employee trust and loyalty.Hire for Culture Fit & CharacterEarly hires determine your startup’s destiny. Prioritize cultural alignment and attitude over just skills. One toxic hire can cost more than several great performers add –  compromise on character.Share context and news (good and bad) openly with your team. Honest communication builds trust and prevents rumor mills. A culture of openness keeps everyone aligned and accountable.Empower, Don’t MicromanageFounders must learn to let go. Give teams ownership of their work and authority to make decisions. Micromanagement erodes morale and trust, whereas empowerment creates a proactive, engaged culture.Be Intentional in Remote CultureFor distributed teams, over-communicate and establish rituals to build cohesion. Use tools and regular check-ins to ensure no one feels isolated. Maintain a strong sense of mission and shared values across borders.Mission and Purpose MatterRally your team around a clear mission. Mission-driven teams have higher engagement and resilience. Align decisions with your core purpose to avoid short-term thinking.Balance Ambition with HumanitySet ambitious goals, but watch for burnout. Encourage a mindset of learning from failures. Recognize and reward efforts, and don’t punish well-intentioned mistakes. A supportive environment will achieve more in the long run.Value Soft Skills in LeadershipEmotional intelligence, communication, and empathy are as crucial as technical savvy (if not more). Great founders grow into  and , not just chief technicians. Invest in your leadership skills like you do in product skills.Evolve and Scale YourselfContinuously adapt your leadership style as the company grows. Implement systems and processes to replace ad-hoc management. Delegate decisions and trust your team – this builds a scalable culture of empowerment.Protect and Nurture CultureTreat culture as your most valuable asset. Don’t sacrifice it for short-term gains. Build a company you admire for its principles and environment, not just its profits. In the end, culture is the legacy that endures in your team’s hearts and careers, whatever the outcome of the startup.By keeping these lessons in mind, first-time founders can avoid common pitfalls and create a startup culture that is not only enjoyable and ethical but also a competitive advantage. Build a company that you and your team will be proud of – one where the culture is , resilient, and truly reflective of the best you have to offer as a leader.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Clean Architecture; How To Keep Your Codebase Scalable Without Overengineering</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/clean-architecture-how-to-keep-your-codebase-scalable-without-overengineering?source=rss</link><author>Aleeza Adnan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:27:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Clean Architecture has turned into the “eat more protein” advice of software engineering. Everyone repeats it. Everyone shares the same circle diagram. Almost no one talks about what it’s actually like to  with it.When I first tried applying it, I kept asking myself: am I writing better code or just more files?Most articles treat Clean Architecture like a theory exam, abstract entities, endless layers, and rules that fall apart the moment a real feature ships. But I don’t write code for diagrams. I write code that has to change, stay testable, and not drive me insane as the product grows.So instead of another diagram, I want to talk about what Clean Architecture looks like in practice the parts worth keeping, the parts that just slow you down, and how to evolve a version that actually works in real projects.What The Layers Actually Look LikeIn my current project, a fairly large one, I’ve settled on a structure that’s simple enough to reason about but strong enough to grow. It follows the usual three layers: , , and . What matters most isn’t the names or number of layers, but how they depend on each other and how responsibilities are divided.==This setup is tuned for mobile development. If you’re working on a web app, the same ideas apply, but the outer layers will look a little different. Where I have background services, local database managers, and offline sync, a web app might rely on browser storage, API caching, or server-driven state. The principles stay identical clean but the implementation details shift with the platform.==The  handles the user-facing side: screens, widgets, and a View Model (VM) for each feature. The VM only talks to the domain layer. That rule alone prevents a lot of accidental coupling and keeps UI code clean.The  defines how the app behaves. It contains all , small, focused pieces of logic that represent what the app . It also declares the , which act as boundaries between the domain and data layers. The data layer can’t just do whatever it wants; it has to conform to these promises. If there’s code in the data layer that no one calls, it simply dies off on its own.The  provides the actual implementations for those repositories. These call into  that handle background events, local storage, and communication with external systems through the . The background service, in turn, keeps things running smoothly, syncing data, writing to the database, and managing API calls, without the rest of the system needing to know the details.All  live in the domain, shared across layers. That keeps data models consistent and avoids the constant mapping that usually clutters large codebases.This setup may look heavy at first, but in practice it saves time and stress. Clear boundaries make it easier to change things without worrying about breaking something unrelated. When a new feature comes in, I know exactly where it belongs. If a bug shows up, I can usually trace it to the right layer within minutes.Over time, this separation of concerns has proven to be the main reason the codebase stays manageable. It’s not about following a pattern perfectly, it’s about keeping the system loosely coupled enough that it can keep growing without turning fragile.What I Learned the Hard WayEarly on, I thought Clean Architecture was about layers and abstractions. It’s not. It’s about staying in control when your codebase starts growing faster than you can refactor. Here are some of the things I learned, some of these may sound like , let me tell you this: IT WAS’NT, at least to me.A layer is only useful if it protects you from something, framework churn, backend changes, or accidental coupling. If it doesn’t, it’s just ceremony.Abstractions should earn their place, Don’t create a repository interface unless you can imagine a second implementation. Theoretical flexibility is just another word for clutter.Domain should never depend on UI frameworks or database details. Every time I ignored that rule, debugging felt like trying to untie headphones.This structure doesn’t make development faster, it makes it . You actually see this pay off when you’re shifting your backend to another platform or maybe redoing your entire UI, THE APP SURVIVES AND SO DO YOU!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Understand Any Codebase in 5 Minutes Using an AI Coding Assistant</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-understand-any-codebase-in-5-minutes-using-an-ai-coding-assistant?source=rss</link><author>James</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:25:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You just cloned a repo. It’s 15,000 lines of code, there’s no documentation, and the README was last updated three years ago. Where do you even start?That’s a situation almost every developer has faced — whether you’re joining a new team or diving into an open-source project for the first time. Understanding how a codebase works can take hours, sometimes days, before you feel confident making changes.But with the rise of , that process is getting a lot easier. Tools powered by large language models can now  your codebase, understand how it’s structured, and even summarize what each folder or file is for. What used to be a slow, manual process can now take just a few minutes.In this walkthrough, I’ll show you how to do it using  inside , specifically leveraging its feature called . You can use the same concept with other assistants that offer project memory or context features like  or Step-by-Step: Understanding a Codebase with Kilocode \nStart by cloning the repository you want to analyze:   git clone https://github.com/your-project.git 
This could be a company project, an open-source repo, or even one of your old codebases that you want to revisit.Install Kilocode in VS CodeIf you haven't used Kilocode before, install it from the marketplace in VS Code (if you're using VS Code).Once it's set up, open your cloned project in VS Code.The  is what allows Kilocode to “remember” and understand your project context.In your project directory, create:   .kilocode/rules/memory-bank/
Inside that folder, add a new file named  and write a short, high-level overview of the project: what it does and why it exists.Next, create another file called:   .kilocode/rules/memory-bank-instructions.md
and paste the content from this document. This helps guide Kilocode’s analysis process.Initialize the Memory BankNow let’s get Kilocode to analyze the project:Switch Kilocode to .Make sure you’re using a high-quality model (avoid lightweight ones).Ask Kilocode to “initialize memory bank.”Wait while it analyzes your entire codebase and builds the documentation.Review the generated files to ensure the descriptions make sense. Edit or refine them as needed.Review the Generated DocsOnce the analysis is complete, Kilocode will create several Markdown files describing your project. These include: — Explains why the project exists, the problems it solves, and the intended user experience. — Tracks current work, recent changes, and next steps for development. — Maps out the system architecture, design patterns, and key component relationships.— Lists frameworks, dependencies, environment setup, and tool configurations.These files effectively serve as auto-generated documentation — giving you a complete picture of the project’s structure and purpose in minutes.Focus especially on  and , since they provide the clearest view of how the system works and what technologies it relies on.I used  as an example project for this tutorial.\
What you’re seeing above are examples of the  generated by Kilocode, including documentation like  and .Each file provides structured insights into the codebase and together; these files give you a clear overview of the project, the kind of understanding that would normally take hours to piece together manually.Instead of scrolling through endless directories or guessing at folder names, you instantly see how the codebase is organized and what each part does.In just a few minutes, you’ve gone from staring at an unfamiliar repo to understanding its logic, structure, and purpose; without digging through every file by hand.What used to take hours of manual exploration; tracing dependencies, scanning files, and guessing architecture, can now be done in minutes with AI assistance. Tools like Kilocode don’t just summarize code; they transform how we onboard, document, and collaborate on software projects.By combining structured analysis with natural-language explanations, AI coding assistants let developers spend less time  the codebase and more time  it. Whether you’re joining a new team, contributing to open source, or auditing an old project, this approach makes understanding large codebases faster, clearer, and far less painful.The rise of AI (and especially large language models) has opened up countless ways to improve how we code and collaborate. One of the most underrated use cases is accelerating code comprehension — turning a time-consuming onboarding process into a quick, structured overview.AI coding assistants aren’t here to replace developers, but they can dramatically boost our productivity. By offloading repetitive cognitive tasks like summarizing code or tracing architecture, developers can spend more time doing what matters: designing, building, and solving real problems.In an era where new AI tools appear every week, it’s worth keeping an open mind and experimenting. You might discover that your next favorite “teammate” is an AI agent that helps you understand codebases faster than ever before.Let’s keep the conversation going!

Not chips, not real estate, not even capital. Just boring old electricity.The numbers are brutal. A single AI facility can require 96 megawatts, enough to power a small city. And unlike traditional data centers that hum along at steady capacity, AI workloads spike unpredictably. You might go from 30% utilization to 95% in an hour when a new model training run kicks off.This creates a nightmare for grid operators. They have to provision for your peak demand, even if you only hit it 10% of the time. And communities are starting to notice. I've watched deals fall apart because local utilities couldn't guarantee the capacity, or city councils rejected permits after residents complained about rate increases.So when I saw the announcement this morning about Emerald AI's Manassas facility, I almost scrolled past it. Another hyperscale build, another "AI-ready" marketing pitch. But when I dug into the technical architecture, I realized this is different.NVIDIA, Emerald AI, EPRI, Digital Realty, and PJM announced the Aurora AI Factory, a 96 MW facility in Manassas, Virginia, slated to open in the first half of 2026. The core idea: what if the data center could negotiate with the grid in real time?Emerald's Conductor platform sits between NVIDIA's orchestration layer and PJM's grid signals. When renewable generation drops or demand spikes, it can slow down or pause non-critical model training, reroute inference jobs to less congested data centers, and modulate power draw depending on renewable generation and peak demand, while maintaining acceptable Quality of Service for training and inference.In other words, they've built interruptible compute into the architecture. The facility essentially becomes a variable load instead of a fixed drain.What Makes This InvestableHere's what caught my attention from a diligence perspective. The software capabilities that Arushi Sharma Frank (Emerald's senior adviser on power and utilities) detailed in Utility Dive this morning show this isn't vaporware.The system can deliver targeted 20-30% power reductions for multi-hour windows during grid peaks, with no snap-back surge afterward. It can sustain curtailments for up to 10 hours. It responds to both rapid (10-minute) and planned (2-hour) dispatch signals. And critically, it can participate in wholesale electricity markets by mapping locational marginal prices into dispatchable bid curves.From an investment perspective, this matters because it changes the unit economics. Utilities are more willing to approve facilities that reduce peak load rather than add to it, which means faster interconnection. Variable loads pay less than fixed loads in most tariff structures, which means lower capacity charges. The facility can sell demand response services back to the grid, creating new revenue streams. And perhaps most importantly, this makes data centers politically defensible, creating a regulatory tailwind.The proof is in their earlier testing. A demonstration showed Emerald AI can reduce AI workload power consumption by 25% over three hours during a grid stress event, while ensuring acceptable performance. That's measured, not modeled.The Market Structure QuestionNow here's where I get skeptical. They claim that if this reference design were adopted nationwide, it could unlock an estimated 100 GW of capacity on the existing electricity system, equivalent to 20% of total U.S. electricity consumption in a year.That feels optimistic and assumes perfect coordination across thousands of facilities. But the directional concept is sound. If you can make AI compute interruptible without breaking SLAs, you solve two problems: you reduce infrastructure costs, and you make data centers politically palatable again.The real test will be whether customers accept the tradeoff. Training runs that take 36 hours instead of 24 because you're opportunistically using cheaper off-peak power? Some will bite. Others won't. The phrase "acceptable Quality of Service" is doing a lot of work here. It means some workloads will run slower or pause when the grid needs relief.What I'm watching for: whether this creates a two-tier market. Latency-sensitive inference stays on traditional fixed-capacity infrastructure, while cost-sensitive training migrates to flex-power facilities. If that split happens, the economics of data center real estate start looking very different, and so do the returns.The Aurora facility will serve as a live innovation hub, running demonstrations with EPRI's DCFlex Initiative to validate performance during heatwaves, renewable shortfalls, and peak loads. Real-world proof matters more than whitepapers at this point.Bottom Line for Infrastructure InvestorsWe're past the point where you can just throw more diesel generators at the problem. The grid won't allow it, permitting won't support it, and the math doesn't work. Power flexibility isn't a nice-to-have anymore. It's table stakes for the next wave of deployment.For anyone evaluating data center infrastructure plays, the questions to ask are shifting. Can the facility participate in demand response programs? What's the economic model for interruptible versus fixed capacity? How does power flexibility affect interconnection timelines? What percentage of workloads can actually tolerate curtailment?The announcement came from Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin this morning, calling it critical for both AI competitiveness and grid affordability. That tells you how serious the political pressure has become around data center power consumption.We'll see if the tech scales. But at least someone's solving the right problem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Build Your First MCP Server using FastMCP</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-your-first-mcp-server-using-fastmcp?source=rss</link><author>Manish Shivanandhan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:23:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is changing how large language models connect with data and tools.Instead of treating an AI model as a black box, MCP gives it structured access to information and actions.It is like the USB-C port for AI, creating a standard way for models to interact with servers that hold real-world data or perform useful tasks.FastMCP is the easiest and fastest framework for building MCP servers with Python. It hides all the complex protocol details and lets you focus on your logic.In this guide, you will learn what MCP is, how FastMCP works, and how to build and run your first MCP server from scratch.Creating Your First MCP ServerConnecting with an MCP ClientAuthentication and SecurityDeploying Your MCP ServerUsing the MCP Server with an LLM ApplicationMCP is a standard protocol that allows language models to talk to external systems in a secure and consistent way. MCP is similar to an API, but built for large language models instead of humans.An MCP server can do three main things.It can expose data as resources (similar to GET endpoints)Provide actions through tools (similar to POST requests)Define prompts that guide how the model interacts with data or users.For example, a resource might return a list of articles, a tool might analyze those articles, and a prompt might define how the model summarizes them. By connecting an LLM to such an MCP server, you give it the power to use your own data and logic in real time.While you could build an MCP server using the official SDK, FastMCP takes things much further. It is a production-ready framework with enterprise authentication, client libraries, testing tools, and automatic API generation.You can use FastMCP to build secure, scalable MCP applications that integrate with providers like Google, GitHub, and Azure. It also supports deployment to the cloud or your own infrastructure.Most importantly, the framework is extremely developer-friendly. You can create a working MCP server in just a few lines of Python code.Creating Your First MCP ServerBefore you start building, install FastMCP in your Python environment. You can use pip or uv. The uv tool is recommended because it handles environments and dependencies efficiently.Once installed, you are ready to write your first server.Every MCP server starts with the  class. This class represents your application and manages your tools, resources, and prompts. Let’s start by creating a simple server that adds two numbers together.Create a file named  and add the following code:from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo Server 🚀")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers and return the result"""
    return a + b
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
That is all you need. You have just created a fully working MCP server with one tool called . When a client calls this tool, the server adds two numbers and returns the result.To run your server locally, open your terminal and type:This command starts the MCP server. You can also use HTTP or SSE transports for web-based deployments. For example, to run your server over HTTP, use:mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, path="/mcp")
Once the server is running, clients can connect and call the  tool remotely.FastMCP tools are simple Python functions that you decorate with . You can add as many as you like. Let’s add a multiplication tool next:@mcp.tool
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiply two numbers"""
    return a * b
You can now run the server again, and clients will have access to both the  and  tools.FastMCP automatically generates schemas based on your function signatures and docstrings, making it easy for clients to understand your API.Resources in MCP represent read-only data that clients can access. You can create static resources or dynamic templates that take parameters. For example, you might expose a version number or a user profile.@mcp.resource("config://version")
def get_version():
    return "1.0.0"

@mcp.resource("user://{user_id}/profile")
def get_profile(user_id: int):
    return {"name": f"User {user_id}", "status": "active"}
In this example, the first resource always returns the version number, while the second resource dynamically fetches a user profile based on the ID provided.FastMCP allows you to access the session context within any tool, resource, or prompt by including a  parameter. The context gives you powerful capabilities like logging, LLM sampling, progress tracking, and resource access.Here is an example that shows how to use context:from fastmcp import Context

@mcp.tool
async def summarize(uri: str, ctx: Context):
    await ctx.info(f"Reading resource from {uri}")
    data = await ctx.read_resource(uri)
    summary = await ctx.sample(f"Summarize this: {data.content[:500]}")
    return summary.text
This tool logs a message, reads a resource, and then asks the client’s language model to summarise it. Context makes your MCP tools smarter and more interactive.Connecting with an MCP ClientOnce your server is running, you can connect to it using the  class. The client can communicate via STDIO, HTTP, or SSE, and can even run in-memory for testing.Here is a simple example of connecting to your local server and calling the  tool:from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with Client("server.py") as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print("Available tools:", tools)
        result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 5, "b": 7})
        print("Result:", result.content[0].text)
asyncio.run(main())
You can also connect to multiple servers using a standard MCP configuration file, making it easy to build complex systems that interact with several services simultaneously.Authentication and SecurityWhen you move from development to production, authentication becomes important.FastMCP has built-in support for enterprise-grade authentication providers such as Google, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, Auth0, and WorkOS. You can enable secure OAuth-based access with just a few lines of code.from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google import GoogleProvider
from fastmcp import FastMCP

auth = GoogleProvider(client_id="...", client_secret="...", base_url="https://myserver.com")
mcp = FastMCP("Secure Server", auth=auth)
Now only authenticated users can access your server. On the client side, you can connect using an OAuth flow like this:async with Client("https://secure-server.com/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
    result = await client.call_tool("protected_tool")
FastMCP handles tokens, refreshes, and error handling automatically.Deploying Your MCP ServerYou can deploy FastMCP servers anywhere.For testing, the  command is enough. For production, you can deploy to FastMCP Cloud, which provides instant HTTPS endpoints and built-in authentication.If you prefer to self-host, use the HTTP or SSE transport to serve your MCP endpoints from your own infrastructure. A simple deployment command might look like this:mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
Once deployed, your MCP server is ready to connect with language models, web clients, or automation workflows.Using the MCP Server with an LLM ApplicationOnce your MCP server is running, the next step is to connect it to a large language model. This allows an LLM to securely call your server’s functions, read resources, and perform actions as part of a conversation.To connect an LLM application, you first define your MCP configuration file. This file lists the available servers, their connection methods, and any authentication requirements.Once configured, the LLM can automatically discover your MCP tools and call them when needed.For example, if your server exposes an  or  tool, the model can directly use them as if they were built-in capabilities. In a chat-based environment, when a user asks the model to perform a task such as “Summarize the latest article,” the LLM will call your  tool, process the result, and respond with the output.If you are building a custom LLM application with frameworks like OpenAI’s Assistants API or LangChain, you can register your MCP server as an external tool. The LLM then interacts with it through the MCP client library.Here is a simple example:from fastmcp import Client
from openai import OpenAI
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Connect to your MCP server
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:
        # Call an MCP tool directly
        result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 10, "b": 5})
        print("MCP Result:", result.content[0].text)
        # Use the result inside an LLM prompt
        llm = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",

In this setup, the LLM can seamlessly combine its reasoning with your server’s logic. It uses the MCP client to fetch data or perform computations and then incorporates the output into its conversation or workflow.This approach lets you build intelligent systems that go beyond static prompts. You can connect your LLM to real databases, APIs, or automation tools, turning it into an active agent that can read, write, and execute with real-world context.FastMCP makes it simple to bring your data, APIs, and tools into the world of AI through the Model Context Protocol. With just a few lines of Python, you can create powerful MCP servers that connect to language models, automate workflows, and handle real-world logic securely.Whether you are building a quick demo or an enterprise-grade system, FastMCP gives you the shortest path from idea to production. Install it today, start your first server, and explore how MCP can unlock the next level of AI integration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Chaos to Quality: A Framework for AI-Assisted Development</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/from-chaos-to-quality-a-framework-for-ai-assisted-development?source=rss</link><author>rdondeti</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:20:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How I turned 11 months of prompt engineering lessons into a system that makes AI coding safe, auditable, and production-readyMy Saturday started like any other vibe coding session. Coffee ready, music on, Claude Code open. I was building a feature and feeling productive until I hit the API selection.The AI confidently chose an API. I implemented it. Tests failed. I asked the AI to fix it. It chose the same API again. Different approach, same deprecated API. After the fifth iteration, I realized: the AI was stuck in a loop, and it was absolutely convinced this deprecated API was the right choice."But this API is deprecated," I'd say."You're right, let me use the current one," it would respond.Next prompt? Back to the deprecated API. With complete confidence.That moment crystallized a problem I'd been dancing around for months: vibe coding is powerful, but it's also frustrating as hell. And I'm not alone in this realization.The AI development community is having a reckoning. We've moved past the honeymoon phase of "wow, AI can code!" and into the uncomfortable reality of production deployments. The criticisms are everywhere:"AI coding tools create security holes""The context window breaks on real projects""My AI gets stuck in infinite loops""This code isn't production ready""It's just glorified autocomplete - another hype bubble"As an Engineering Manager with 18 years of experience and founder of DS APPS Inc, I've seen both sides. I've used AI to ship Android apps and open-source projects faster than ever before. But I've also seen the chaos that emerges when you let AI run wild without structure.So I spent the past 8-12 months mastering prompt engineering, learning from failures, and documenting what actually works. The result is  - a framework that turns any AI coding assistant into a disciplined software development team.And here's the radical part: it's not software. It's pure prompt engineering.The Three Struggles That Led to DevFlowMy journey with AI coding tools started like most developers: excitement mixed with frustration. As I pushed beyond simple scripts into real projects, three critical problems emerged:1. The Prompt Paralysis ProblemIn the beginning, every interaction with the AI was a negotiation. How do I phrase this? What context do I include? Should I be specific or let the AI decide? I was spending more time crafting prompts than I would have spent just writing the code myself.The AI would make architectural decisions without asking me. It would choose library versions arbitrarily. It would implement features in ways that didn't align with my project's patterns. I felt like I was managing a developer who wouldn't ask questions.2. The Context CatastropheAs projects grew beyond a few hundred lines, the context window became my enemy. The AI would forget critical constraints from earlier in the conversation. It would contradict its own earlier decisions. It would recreate functionality that already existed.I needed sub-agents - separate contexts for separate concerns - but managing that manually was exhausting.I wanted the AI to work while I slept. I wanted to delegate entire features and wake up to completed, tested code. But every attempt at autonomous AI coding ended in one of two ways:The AI asked me a question and sat idle for 8 hoursThe AI made assumptions and built the wrong thingWhat I needed was a system that could operate autonomously but tracked every decision it made, creating an audit trail I could review and question later.The Insight: AI Doesn't Need Better Models, It Needs Better ProcessAfter months of iteration, I had a realization: the problem wasn't the AI's capabilities - it was the lack of engineering discipline.Traditional software development has structure for a reason:Product managers define requirementsArchitects make technical decisionsDevelopers implement codeSecurity reviews for vulnerabilitiesWhy were we throwing all of that away just because AI was doing the typing?That's when DevFlow clicked into place. What if I could encode software engineering methodology into a prompt engineering framework? What if the AI could role-play different team members, each with their own responsibilities and quality gates?DevFlow: Where AI Meets Engineering DisciplineDevFlow is a config-driven framework that orchestrates AI coding assistants through structured prompts. It's not a new tool you need to install - it works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or any AI assistant.1. Clone DevFlow Into Your Projectcd YourProject
git clone https://github.com/dondetir/DevFlow.git DevFlow
echo "DevFlow/" >> .gitignore
# DevFlow Orchestration
Read and follow: ./DevFlow/ORCHESTRATOR.md
For Cursor (.cursorrules), Gemini CLI (gemini.md), or other tools - same line, different config file.Auto-initialize the  structureGuide you through the right workflowThe Architecture: 9 Agents, 5 Workflows, Pure PromptsDevFlow introduces , each with distinct behaviors defined in YAML files: - Routes tasks to the right workflow - Writes user stories and requirements - Designs technical solutions and presents options - Implements server-side code - Builds user interfaces - Handles AI/ML components - Manages deployment and infrastructure - Writes and runs tests - Reviews code for vulnerabilitiesThe same AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or any other model) role-plays each agent by reading their YAML-defined behaviors. This isn't specific to one AI provider DevFlow works across any coding agent that can read config files. It's prompt engineering at scale.DevFlow automatically routes your request to the appropriate workflow: (2 gates, 30-120 min)Rapid production issue resolutionCompressed decision-makingEmergency approval process (2 gates, 45-90 min)Fast analysis and targeted fixRoot cause identification (3 gates, 2h-3 days)Code quality improvement without behavior changesIncremental refactoring with continuous testing (3 gates, 1-5 days)Balanced design and implementationComponent-level development (4 gates + execution, weeks-months)Full architecture and planningSprint-based autonomous executionThe Two-Prompt Magic: From Idea to Autonomous ExecutionThe genius of DevFlow is its simplicity. You give it , and then it can run autonomously:Prompt 1: "Here's what I want to build…" The AI creates a Product Strategy Assessment (PSA), breaks it into epics and user stories, and documents the business requirements.Prompt 2: "I choose Architecture Option B" The AI has presented you with 2-3 architectural approaches. You pick one. Now it has everything it needs to execute.After those two decisions, the AI can work autonomously while you sleep, with every decision documented in  status files.Real-World Proof: Building Simple MCP in One SessionTo test DevFlow, I built Simple MCP - an educational Model Context Protocol server designed to teach developers how MCP works.MCP is hot right now (GitHub just launched their MCP Registry in September 2025), and building a server from scratch typically requires:Understanding the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocolImplementing STDIO transportDefining tools, resources, and promptsWriting comprehensive documentationTesting with multiple MCP clientsI cloned DevFlow into the projectI gave it one prompt: "Build an educational MCP server that demonstrates basic MCP concepts"The Architect agent presented 3 implementation approachesI chose Option B (balanced complexity)DevFlow executed autonomouslyThe result? A working MCP server with:README with setup instructionsSecurity review completedNo back-and-forth prompting. No context loss. No security holes. Just a production-ready educational tool.How DevFlow Solves the "Vibe Coding" CriticismsLet me address each criticism directly:"AI Coding Creates Security Issues" The Security Expert agent reviews every piece of code with a security-focused lens. It checks for common vulnerabilities (injection attacks, authentication bypasses, data exposure) and provides recommendations. Everything is documented in the audit trail.You still need to review it - DevFlow handles about 80% of the security analysis - but you have a structured security assessment rather than hoping you caught everything manually."Context Loss Breaks Real Projects" Sub-agents with separate contexts. Each agent (Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, etc.) maintains its own context window. The  status files persist state across sessions, so context is never lost between conversations.When you return after 8 hours, DevFlow reads the status files and knows exactly where it left off."AI Gets Stuck in Infinite Loops" Quality gates ensure understanding before implementation. The AI can't start coding until it's completed the analysis phase. It can't mark a story complete until different agents have reviewed and tested it.The workflow structure prevents the "regenerate the same buggy code 10 times" problem because gates force the AI to move through distinct phases."AI Code Isn't Production Ready" Three-agent quality process:A Dev agent writes the codeA different Dev agent reviews it (peer review simulation)QA agent tests it and verifies acceptance criteriaThis catches about 80% of production readiness issues. The human still needs to do final review, but DevFlow handles the bulk of quality assurance."It's Just Hype - AI Can't Really Code" I take the middle stance. AI coding is a tool - used wisely, it's transformative. Used carelessly, it's destructive.DevFlow encodes the "wisely" part. It's not about making AI smarter; it's about making AI more disciplined.The 80% Rule: What DevFlow Automates (And What It Doesn't)Let me be clear about what DevFlow does and doesn't do:DevFlow Automates (≈80%):Requirement analysis and story creationArchitecture option generationTest case generation and executionSecurity vulnerability scanningHumans Must Still (≈20%):Make strategic architecture decisionsVerify acceptance criteriaMake final production approvalHandle edge cases the AI missedUnderstand the business contextDevFlow isn't trying to replace developers. It's trying to give developers a disciplined AI development team that does the grunt work while preserving human judgment for critical decisions.Why This Matters: Democratizing AI DevelopmentThe promise of AI coding tools was supposed to be democratization - anyone could build software. But the reality has been gatekeeping by expertise: only people who master prompt engineering can use AI tools effectively.DevFlow flips this. You don't need to be a prompt engineering expert. You don't need to know how to structure agent conversations or manage context windows or prevent infinite loops.DevFlow encodes that expertise for you. learning software engineering - DevFlow teaches them process while they build building MVPs - DevFlow gives them a full dev team without hiring costsCompanies Afraid of AI Risk - DevFlow provides the audit trail and quality gates they need wanting to ship faster - DevFlow handles the boilerplate so they focus on hard problemsThe Technical Deep Dive: How It Actually WorksFor the engineers reading this who want to understand the mechanics:DevFlow is a collection of: defining agent behaviors, workflow rules, and quality gates for documents (PSA, stories, architecture proposals) (JSON) tracking progress across sessions () that the AI readsWhen you start your AI tool, it reads  which references all the other configs. The AI essentially "compiles" the framework by reading these prompts.No code execution. No dependencies. No binary. Just the AI following structured instructions.The workflows are defined as state machines:workflow: bug_fix
phases:
  - name: analysis
    agents: [architect]
    gates: [root_cause_identified]
  - name: implementation  
    agents: [backend_dev, frontend_dev]
    gates: [code_reviewed, tests_passing]
The AI reads this, understands the flow, and orchestrates itself through the phases.It's prompt engineering as infrastructure.Getting Started: Your First DevFlow ProjectReady to try it? Here's how to start:Start with something small - a feature, a bug fix, or a simple utility. Don't start with your production codebase.git clone https://github.com/dondetir/DevFlow.git DevFlow
Add the orchestrator line to your AI tool's config (claude.md, .cursorrules, etc.)Launch Claude Code, Cursor, or your preferred tool. DevFlow will initialize automatically.Which architecture approach?DevFlow will execute autonomously. Check the  folder to see progress.When DevFlow completes a phase, review the documents it created. Approve or request changes.DevFlow is MIT licensed and actively evolving. Here's what I'm thinking about: - Imagine a community repository of workflows:Mobile app development workflowData science pipeline workflowInfrastructure as code workflow - Track DevFlow's effectiveness:Time saved vs. traditional developmentDefect rates for DevFlow projectsQuality gate pass/fail ratesIntegration with Project Management - Export DevFlow status to Jira, Linear, GitHub Projects - Let different agents use different models (GPT for architecture, Claude for coding, etc.)But I need your help to build this.If you're a CTO, engineering manager, or founder concerned about AI development risks, DevFlow addresses your core worries:✅  - Every decision documented✅  - No incomplete work marked as done✅  - Automated vulnerability scanning✅  - Different agents review each other's code✅  - State persists across sessionsYou get the velocity of AI development with the safety of traditional software engineering.The Honest Take: DevFlow Isn't PerfectLet me be transparent about limitations:DevFlow requires an AI tool that supports reading config files (Claude Code, Cursor, etc. work; basic ChatGPT doesn't)The initial setup requires understanding your AI tool's config systemDevFlow is still evolving - you'll encounter rough edgesIt works best with projects that fit standard workflows (custom workflows need more work)The AI can still make mistakes - the 80% rule is realBut even with these limitations, DevFlow has fundamentally changed how I build software. I ship faster, with fewer bugs, and with complete documentation of every decision made.Your Turn: Share Your ExperienceI'm releasing DevFlow as open source because I believe structured AI development is too important to be proprietary. I want to see what you build with it.Try DevFlow on your next project:What workflows did you use?What would make DevFlow better?Questions? Open an issue on GitHub or reach out. I'm actively developing DevFlow and want to hear what real developers need.The AI revolution in software development is happening. But it doesn't have to be chaotic. We can have both the velocity of AI and the discipline of engineering.DevFlow is my answer to making AI coding safe, auditable, and production-ready. It's not about replacing developers with AI - it's about giving developers AI teammates that follow the same rigorous processes we expect from human engineers.The code we write with AI should be as trustworthy as the code we write ourselves. DevFlow is how we get there.Now it's your turn. Clone the repo. Build something. Break something. Learn something. And share what you discover.Because the best way to solve the vibe coding problem isn't to stop using AI - it's to give AI better guardrails.About the Author: I'm an Engineering Manager with 18 years of experience and founder of DS APPS Inc, a nonprofit publishing free Android apps and open-source AI applications.

However, most of the LLM apps I've used have a linear chat structure, as in one question after another. Now let's say I want to ask a question and compare the outputs from different LLMs. I'll have to manually copy paste the answer from the first LLM into another word document, and then I have to rebuild or ask the same question while selecting a different LLM toggle. Then I have to copy paste that and compare. Let's say I forget to copy paste any of the answers, then I've lost that answer forever, as even if I choose the first LLM again, I'll never get the same answer. With this, users aren't able to conduct comprehensive research on their topic of interest, and manually copy pasting is not a good user experience.===============================================================================

Adding onto this, Having a local git-like architecture in the backend would be very helpful. This git-inspired architecture can be saved locally on a device, just like how we used to save game progress from PC games in a folder. It would save a snapshot of every output in the background, and users can access that view whenever they need to. This will help them in their study and even learn new things along the way. They'll know if they need to fine-tune their prompt or not depending on the output they are trying to achieve.===============================================================================

Also, based on what the user is trying to do, the LLM can suggest a more optimized prompt that can get users to their end goal sooner. This way, the user will spend less time on the app since they'll get their desired output faster, thus burning fewer tokens, which also costs less for the LLM chat company. If you think about it, it's a very interesting win-win.===============================================================================

Finally, the complete chat conversation should be able to be exported in a well-formatted PDF document. The format would be -  Question 1: answer from model 1, answer from model 2, answer from model 3. Then Question 2: answer from model 2, answer from model 4. Question 1.1 (which means it's an edit of the first question): answer from model 1, answer from model 5, and so on. This makes it easy to compare different models side by side and keep everything organized for research purposes.===============================================================================

I've been there dozens of times.The problem isn't lack of ideas—it's the gap between concept and execution. Most AI prompts for podcast scripting give you generic, robotic-sounding content that feels like it was written by someone who's never actually recorded a podcast.So I spent months building something different. A comprehensive prompt system that transforms any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, or Qwen) into a professional podcast scriptwriter who understands audio-first content, listener psychology, and what makes people actually stay engaged.Why Most Podcast Scripts FailLet's be honest about what goes wrong:: "Welcome to another episode where we discuss interesting topics…" (Nobody cares): Writing like a blog post instead of something people will hear without visual context: Either too dense or too sparse, missing the rhythm that keeps attention: Starting with "Today we're going to talk about…" instead of something that grabs attention immediately: Missing the moments that make people lean in, nod, or reach for their phone to shareThe issue? Most prompts treat podcast scripting like writing an article. But podcasts are different—they're intimate, conversational, and consumed while people are doing other things (driving, working, exercising).The Solution: Audio-First Script EngineeringI built a prompt that understands podcasting isn't about information transfer—it's about connection and engagement. The system includes:1. Professional Role DefinitionInstead of "helpful assistant," the AI becomes a "professional podcast scriptwriter with 10+ years of experience in audio content creation." Specific expertise matters.2. Audio-First Content StructureThe prompt enforces podcast-specific sections: (0:30-1:00): Hook that captures attention immediately (1:00-2:00): Branding and value proposition (70-80% of runtime): Segments with natural transitions (2-3 minutes): Recap and clear call-to-action (0:30): Music and credits3. Technical Production CuesBecause podcasts are audio, the prompt includes:Music cues: Sound effects: Pacing markers:  and Timestamp estimates: Production notes: (NOTE: Direction for host)4. Conversational Writing StandardsThe prompt enforces natural language:Contractions and casual speech patternsMix of sentence lengths for rhythmDirect audience address ("you" instead of "listeners")Energy variation markers for different segmentsDifferent podcast types need different approaches:: Personal stories and direct advice: Flexible structure with guest expertise highlights: Storytelling techniques and suspense building: Banter and chemistry between hostsReal Results: Before and AfterTypical AI output for podcast scripting:Welcome to episode 47. Today we will be discussing the importance of productivity in modern workplace environments. 

First, let's examine the historical context of productivity methodologies...

You know what's wild? Most productivity advice is written by people who've never actually had to meet a payroll while managing three kids and a deadline.

## [TIMESTAMP: 00:45] INTRO

[MUSIC: Main theme]

Welcome to Productivity Real Talk—I'm your host, Sarah Chen, and this is where we skip the fluff and talk about what actually works when you're juggling work, life, and everything in between.

Today we're diving into something that might make some productivity gurus uncomfortable: sometimes the most productive thing you can do is say no.

[MUSIC: Upbeat, optimistic intro fade in]

You know what's wild? Most of us spend more time choosing what to watch on Netflix than we do looking at where our money actually goes. And I get it—thinking about finances can feel overwhelming, right?

But here's the thing: what if I told you that you could save **five hundred dollars** this month without giving up your morning coffee or living on ramen noodles?

[PAUSE]

Sounds too good to be true? Stick around, because I'm about to break down five realistic, actually-doable strategies that could put an extra $500 back in your pocket by the end of November.

[MUSIC: Fade out]

[MUSIC: Main theme]

Welcome to Money Matters Made Simple—I'm your host, Jordan Ellis, and this is the podcast where we take the intimidation out of personal finance and replace it with actionable strategies you can implement **today**.

If you're new here, welcome! And if you're a returning listener, thank you for being part of this community of money-smart folks.

Today's episode is all about immediate impact. We're not talking about long-term investment strategies or complex financial instruments. This is pure, practical money-saving tactics you can start using this week.

[TIMESTAMP: 01:15] SEGMENT 1: THE SUBSCRIPTION AUDIT

Alright, let's dive into strategy number one, and honestly? This one alone could get you to that $500 goal.

**The Subscription Audit.**

(NOTE: Slow down, emphasize)

Here's what I want you to do—right now, pull out your phone. I'm serious! Pause this if you need to, because this exercise takes about 10 minutes and could save you hundreds.

[PAUSE]

Open your banking app or credit card statement and scroll through the last two months. Look for any recurring charges. And I mean **all** of them. We're talking:

- Streaming services you forgot you signed up for [PAUSE]
- That gym membership you haven't used since February [PAUSE]  
- App subscriptions that renew automatically [PAUSE]
- That "free trial" you forgot to cancel three years ago [PAUSE]

Most people find at least $30 to $50 per month in subscriptions they don't use or even remember. Over a year, that's $360 to $600 dollars literally going to waste.

## [TIMESTAMP: 00:00] COLD OPEN

[MUSIC: Tech-inspired ambient intro]

**HOST**: In 2020, we were all scrambling to figure out Zoom. In 2025, we've got AI meeting assistants, virtual reality offices, and collaboration tools that predict what we need before we even ask for it.

But here's the question nobody's really answering: are we actually working **better**, or just... differently?

**MARCUS** (Preview clip): "The tools are incredible. The technology is there. But we're solving the wrong problems."

**HOST**: That's Marcus Thompson, CEO of CollabSpace, and trust me—what he's about to share about the future of remote work will change how you think about your entire tech stack.

Welcome to Tech Leaders Unplugged—I'm Alex Rivera, and this is where we go beyond the press releases and get real talk from the people building the technology that's shaping our world.

Today, I'm talking with Marcus Thompson. Marcus is the CEO and co-founder of CollabSpace, which just hit 10 million users this year. But before that, he spent eight years at Google leading distributed teams, and he's been thinking about remote work since way before it was cool.

Marcus, welcome to the show!

**MARCUS**: Thanks for having me, Alex! Great to be here.

**HOST**: So I want to jump right in because you said something in a recent interview that kind of broke my brain a little bit. You said most remote work tools are—quote—"solving yesterday's problems." What do you mean by that?

You're competing with hundreds of other programs for attention from affiliates who are already making good money promoting your competitors.Here's what actually works: finding people who are already successfully creating content about products like yours, and reaching out to them directly. It's not rocket science, but it's incredibly time-consuming if you're doing it manually.  because it shows you who is promoting your competitors on their website or social media.It’s not limited to one particular network or database, and it runs weekly scans to pick up on the freshest opportunities to promote your product or brand.But the right tool for you will depend on your budget, your ICP, and the stage you’re at with your affiliate program. In this guide, I'll break down the 9 best options, explain exactly what makes each one valuable, and help you figure out which tool (or combination of tools) will actually grow your program without wasting your time or budget.|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  | Custom, AI-powered affiliate discovery | AI web scraping + weekly scans | $99/month with 7-day free trial |
|  | Running a SaaS affiliate program | Built-in affiliate discovery | Free until $1K revenue (then $39/month) |
|  | Traditional publishers | Network integration | $456/month |
|  | Marketplace access | 3M+ affiliate network | $39/month + fees |
|  | Influencer recruitment | 100M+ creator database | $299/month |
|  | Multi-channel campaigns | E-commerce integration | Custom (est. $500+/month) |
|  | Enterprise influencer programs | AI automation (Gia) | Custom (est. $1,000+/month) |
|  | Influencer discovery across 30+ platforms | 40+ filter options | $199/month |
|  | Partnership intelligence | Free B2B directory | Free | is the best affiliate discovery tool for SaaS and e-commerce brands because it finds potential partners who are already talking about products just like yours.Whereas many other tools rely solely on their own directory or marketplace, AffiliateFinder.ai scans the whole internet to find the best-match affiliates for your brand. \n I tested this with a client in the keyword research tool space. Within 15 minutes of setting it up, AffiliateFinder.ai found 1300+ potential affiliates - bloggers ranking for "Ahrefs alternatives," YouTubers reviewing competitor products, and websites comparing tools in the space. More importantly, these weren't just names in a database from 2019. These were people who had published content in the last few weeks, so I got a much higher response rate than I had with other tools, and recruited more new partners.The platform works by continuously scanning the web, YouTube, and Instagram for anyone mentioning your competitors or ranking for your target keywords. It uses AI to filter out irrelevant results (like Wikipedia pages or your actual competitors) and delivers a curated list of partnership opportunities.You can view all the stats you need to help make a decision (subscribers, views, engagement rate) without having to leave your dashboard.This list gets updated every week, with an email notifying you of the top results, so now I have over 3,000 opportunities for this client.AffiliateFinder.ai’s filters make it easy to sort through your results and prioritize outreach according to your campaign goals.For example, if you want to work with nano-influencers with small but engaged audiences, you can filter results to show those with less than 10k subscribers.As you go through the results, you can add them to different lists according to how relevant they are. From your ‘saved’ list, you can check contact details - this finds email addresses and social media profiles associated with the domain or channel.The YouTube email finder deserves special mention because it solves one of the most annoying problems in affiliate recruitment. Normally, getting a YouTuber's email means breaking CAPTCHAs manually, which YouTube actively limits.It even finds Linkedin and Twitter (X) profiles for some affiliates, so you can DM them directly if they’re more active on social media than email. AffiliateFinder.ai finds these emails in seconds, turning what would be hours of tedious work into a single click. I've personally used this to reach out to 83 YouTube creators in a single afternoon - something that would have taken me several days (and multiple YouTube accounts) to do manually.The platform supports 195+ countries and 40+ languages, which matters more than you might think. If you're expanding internationally, you can set up separate scans for each geo and find Australian travel influencers, French beauty creators, or Swedish sneaker reviewers - whatever you need to get more eyes on your product. Growing SaaS companies, agencies managing multiple clients, e-commerce brands in competitive niches, and anyone who’s had enough of outdated affiliate databases.Finds 500-750+ relevant affiliates instantlyWeekly automated scans catch new opportunitiesFinds emails for websites, YouTube channels, and Instagram pagesCompetitor-based discovery (proven performers)Multi-geo and multi-language supportNo built-in affiliate tracking or paymentsRequires a separate outreach tool for campaignsResults still need a manual sense-check Includes unlimited discovery, 150 email credits monthly, 1 brand analysis, 2 users 500 email credits, 5 brands, 5 users  Custom pricing and packages (API, custom webhooks) If you're serious about scaling your affiliate program and have the budget for a professional tool, AffiliateFinder.ai should be your first purchase after affiliate tracking software. The competitive intelligence approach fundamentally changes how you recruit - from hoping affiliates find you to actively poaching your competitors' best partners.2. Endorsely: Best Budget Option for SaaS combines affiliate recruitment with full program management, wrapping it all in a pricing model that's genuinely friendly to early-stage companies: it's free until your affiliate program generates $1,000 in monthly revenue. \n  Think about that for a second. You can discover affiliates, track their performance, manage payouts, and grow your program to $12K annual revenue before spending a single dollar on the platform. Then it's just $39/month until you hit $5,000 monthly, and $99/month after that. Compare this to Impact or PartnerStack charging hundreds (or thousands) per month from day one, plus transaction fees on top.Endorsely is specifically designed to manage SaaS affiliate programs, meaning it handles subscriptions, upgrades, and recurring commissions seamlessly.And the great thing is that it has AI-powered affiliate discovery built in, along with email enrichment.Endorsely only covers websites and YouTube channels, so it’s not quite as comprehensive as AffiliateFinder.ai. It also lacks some features like lists and labels.But overall, it’s fantastic value for money - and incredibly well designed - for anyone running a SaaS affiliate program. SaaS companies launching their first affiliate program, bootstrapped startups watching every dollar, and anyone who wants discovery plus management without the enterprise price tag.Completely free until $1K monthly revenueFull program management includedTracks recurring subscription revenue properlyLTV analytics for customer quality insightsSimple, predictable pricing structureDiscovery less comprehensive than dedicated toolsFewer features than enterprise platformsWeekly scans not includedNot designed for e-commerce or service businesses Until $1,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 15 affiliates Up to $5,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 100 affiliates/month Up to $20,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 250 affiliates/month If you're launching an affiliate program for a SaaS product and need both discovery and tracking,  gives you everything in one package at a price point that won't make your CFO wince. Use it to get your first 50 affiliates, then consider adding AffiliateFinder.ai when you're ready to scale aggressively.3. Publisher Discovery: Best for Traditional Affiliate SitesPublisher Discovery is the tool for brands that want deep data on traditional affiliate websites - the established review sites, comparison blogs, and publisher networks that have been in the game for years.The platform integrates directly with major affiliate networks like ShareASale, CJ, and Impact, which gives it access to performance data that standalone tools can't match. You can search by vertical or network, but there’s no custom discovery based on your brand.Publisher Discovery allows you to filter publishers by SEO metrics (domain authority, traffic volume), see which networks they're active on, and even track their performance once you recruit them. This network integration is huge if you're already running programs on these platforms and want to expand beyond your current affiliate pool.Detailed reporting includes competitor gap analysis and publisher performance benchmarking, which is helpful for identifying your top performers and helping those who are underperforming.Who it's for: Enterprise brands working with affiliate networks, programs targeting established publishers rather than influencers, and teams that need performance data integration.Deep integration with major networksRich SEO and performance dataQuality-focused filteringPerformance tracking post-recruitmentPremium solution ($450+ per month)Limited to affiliates registered on networksSteeper learning curve than simpler tools All features for one campaign (single geo) Five campaigns Unlimited campaigns combines affiliate program management with a built-in marketplace of 3 million affiliates, giving you instant access to thousands of active partners looking for new programs to promote.The marketplace is the real draw here - over 5,000 affiliates actively browse for opportunities, and you can filter them by platform, niche, keywords, and performance metrics.Instead of cold outreach, you're connecting with people who are actively seeking partnerships. I've seen programs get 20-30 quality applications within the first week of listing.However, once you have exhausted the pool of affiliates listed on Refersion for your vertical, new ones don’t come along too often. A tool like AffiliateFinder.ai is better if you want to keep proactively discovering new opportunities every week.Beyond discovery, Refersion handles the full program lifecycle: tracking, commission payments, tax forms (W-9s and 1099s), and automated communications. The first-party cookie tracking is solid, and the platform integrates with major e-commerce platforms, making setup relatively painless.Who it's for: E-commerce brands, D2C companies, and businesses that want a ready-made network plus management tools in one package.3M+ affiliate network with 5,000+ active partnersFull program management includedAutomated commission processing and tax handlingGood filtering for marketplace affiliatesTransaction fees (up to 3%) on top of monthly costMarketplace means competing with other brands for attentionLimited pool of affiliates that doesn’t refresh quicklyLaunch ($39/month + 3% of affiliate sales): Core features, unlimited affiliatesGrowth ($129/month + 2% of affiliate sales): Advanced tracking, email attribution, private offersScale ($599/month + 1% of affiliate sales): Advanced commission options, multi-store support5. Modash: Best for Influencer-Heavy StrategiesModash indexes every social media profile with at least 1,000 followers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube - that means hundreds of millions of creators searchable through one interface.The filtering is impressively robust: follower range, location, engagement rate, audience demographics, growth trends, and even fake follower detection. I used it to find 50 Instagram food influencers with 5K-50K followers and minimum 3% engagement in under five minutes. It even has an AI Search option so you can find recent posts of men tying their shoelaces or kids playing with toy cars.One final touch is the influential follower check: you may have influential people following your brand already, and Modash finds them for you.The platform includes email campaigns, tracking, and payment processing so you can manage everything in one place.Who it's for: D2C brands prioritizing influencer partnerships, consumer product companies, and anyone focusing on social media affiliates over traditional publishers.Massive database (every profile with 1K+ followers)Powerful filtering with 40+ criteriaFast, intuitive interfaceExpensive compared to some other toolsInfluencer-focused (less useful for B2B or traditional affiliates)Requires separate tracking software 2 team members, 300 profiles, 150 emailsPerformance ($599/month): 5 team members, 800 profiles, 400 emails, broader content discoveryEnterprise (custom pricing): Higher limits, more seats, paymentsUpfluence offers influencer discovery across all major social networks plus unique features like scanning your customer database to identify which customers are influencers.The platform provides 20+ advanced filters to search its large creator database, with detailed metrics including audience demographics, engagement rates, and estimated sponsored post pricing. \n The e-commerce integration lets you connect your Shopify or WooCommerce store, and Upfluence can identify existing customers with significant social followings, turning them into brand ambassadors. This is a feature I haven’t seen anywhere else, and it’s very valuable for established brands.The affiliate tracking module lets you generate unique codes and referral links for each influencer, tracking sales back to specific creators. Combined with content management, product seeding automation, and campaign analytics, you get a true all-in-one platform.Who it's for: Large brands with significant influencer budgets, agencies managing diverse clients, companies running complex multi-channel campaigns.Comprehensive multi-platform coverageCustomer-to-affiliate conversion featureRich audience data and authenticity metricsFull campaign management includedComplex platform with learning curveOverkill for pure affiliate recruitment needsCustom pricing, generally starting around $500/month with annual contracts, can exceed $1,000/month.7. GRIN: Best for Enterprise Influencer ProgramsGRIN is an enterprise-grade creator management platform with affiliate capabilities, designed for brands managing hundreds of influencer relationships simultaneously with AI-powered automation.The platform's AI assistant "Gia" suggests optimal creators, predicts performance, and automates routine tasks like follow-ups and content tracking. You get complete lifecycle management: discovery, product seeding, content approvals, affiliate link tracking, and payment processing - all in one system. The relationship CRM tracks every conversation, content piece, and product shipment per creator.The affiliate module generates unique codes and links for each influencer, tracking sales and automatically calculating commissions. For brands running hybrid influencer-affiliate programs at scale, GRIN removes the operational chaos and tracks everything in one manageable place.The only downside is that GRIN is focused on social media creators, so you’ll need to pair it with another platform if you want to partner with bloggers too.Who it's for: Large D2C brands, major e-commerce companies, agencies with significant influencer budgets (think 100+ active partnerships).AI automation (Gia) for optimization and suggestionsComplete creator lifecycle managementProduct seeding and content managementRobust analytics and reportingOne of the most expensive options ($1,000-$2,500+/month)Annual contracts requiredOverkill for smaller programsCustom pricing starts at around $1,000 per month.Influencers Club gives you searchable access to 200M+ influencer profiles across more than 30 platforms, including Spotify and Udemy. This broad range of coverage means you can often find creators who don’t show up on bigger platforms like Instagram and YouTube.The 40+ advanced filters let you narrow by platform, follower count, location, engagement rate, posting frequency, and even specific bio keywords.Each creator listed already has a verified email, which is good for easy outreach but may exclude some great opportunities without an email on record.On the API plan, you’re able to use Influencers Club data to enrich your own list of emails or usernames. There’s also the option for a fully managed plan where their team takes care of the outreach for you.Who it's for: Influencer-focused brands running targeted campaigns across multiple platformsInfluencer-heavy (less for traditional publishers)No website/blogger discoveryLimited to creators with emailsDashboard (from $199/month): Discovery and outreach for 200M+ creators with emailsAPI + Dashboard (from $249/month): Includes API access, bulk data, enrichment Fully managed outreach servicePartnerbase is a free public directory of 147,000+ companies and 456,000+ B2B partnerships, making it a valuable research tool for identifying potential affiliate relationships.While not specifically an affiliate recruitment platform, Partnerbase helps you understand the partnership landscape in your industry. You can see which companies have affiliate programs, research competitors' partner ecosystems, and identify businesses that might be good affiliate partners based on their existing relationships.The real value is in research and intelligence rather than direct recruitment. Use it to identify companies worth approaching, understand what partner programs exist in adjacent spaces, and find opportunities for strategic affiliate partnerships beyond typical content creators.Who it's for: B2B companies on tight budgets, researchers mapping partnership landscapes, anyone needing free competitive intelligence.Completely free with registration456,000+ partnerships indexedHelps identify affiliate program opportunitiesRequires manual follow-up workLimited compared to paid tools Complete access with registrationPicking the right recruitment tool isn't about finding the "best" option - it's about matching your specific situation to the right solution. Here's how to think through the decision.Let's do the math that actually matters. If you're an affiliate manager making $60K annually ($30/hour), and manual recruitment takes 20 hours weekly, that's $600/week or $2,400/month of your time. A tool like  at $99/month that saves 75% of that time creates $1,800/month in value - an 18x return.Even tools that seem expensive like GRIN at $1,500/month can justify themselves if you're managing 100+ influencer relationships. That's $15 per relationship monthly for complete automation. Without it, you'd need to hire another full-time person. like Partnerbase and Endorsely's free tier make sense when you're validating whether an affiliate channel works for your business. But once you have proof of concept, the time savings from paid tools become obvious.Launching (0-10 affiliates): Start with manual research and outreach within your network. Focus on proving the channel works before investing heavily in discovery tools.Early Growth (10-50 affiliates): Add AffiliateFinder.ai Pro at $99/month. The competitor intelligence approach helps you reach quality at this stage when every partnership matters.Scaling (50-200 affiliates): Upgrade to AffiliateFinder.ai Agency or add specialized tools like Modash for influencers. Consider Refersion if marketplace access speeds up recruitment.Enterprise (200+ affiliates): GRIN, Upfluence, or other enterprise platforms start making sense. You need sophisticated management alongside discovery. You may want to keep AffiliateFinder.ai to make sure you never run out of new opportunities.The type of affiliate you want to target makes a difference to the tool you choose. Here’s what I recommend:Traditional publishers and bloggers: AffiliateFinder.ai, Publisher Discovery, or Endorsely. These tools excel at finding web content creators.Instagram/TikTok influencers: Modash, Influencers Club, or Upfluence. You need social-first databases with engagement metrics. AffiliateFinder.ai (for the email finder specifically) or Modash. Breaking CAPTCHAs manually will kill your productivity. Publisher Discovery, Partnerbase for research, or AffiliateFinder.ai for finding B2B content creators.Most successful programs need multiple types, which is why many teams run 2-3 tools. For example: AffiliateFinder.ai for bloggers + Modash for influencers, or Refersion marketplace for passive recruitment + AffiliateFinder.ai for active outreach.Discovery vs Management: Why You Need BothAffiliate discovery tools and management platforms solve different problems.While many affiliate management platforms include some type of discovery, it’s typically limited to partners already registered on their platform.A management platform is necessary from day 1 to track affiliate performance and process commissions, but a specialized discovery tool like AffiliateFinder.ai is essential if you want to expand beyond pre-defined marketplaces.When I started out in affiliate management, most of these tools didn’t exist. The options were basically to post in directories and hope for the best, turn manual research into a full-time job, or hire an agency. Today, AI-powered tools give even solo founders the ability to execute sophisticated competitive intelligence strategies that used to require entire teams. wins for most teams because it solves the actual hard problem: finding high-quality affiliates who are already proven performers in your niche.The weekly updates mean you're continuously discovering new opportunities without manual work, and the competitive intelligence angle gives you an unfair advantage over companies still relying on passive recruitment.But the most successful affiliate programs I've seen run a hybrid approach: AffiliateFinder.ai for proactive outreach to competitors' affiliates, a marketplace like Refersion for passive inbound applications, and maybe Upfluence or Modash for more reach into social platforms.When budget is the constraint, Endorsely's free tier gets you started with both discovery and management for literally zero dollars until you hit $1k monthly revenue. That's enough to prove the channel works before investing more heavily.When you need enterprise-scale influencer management and have the budget, GRIN or Upfluence deliver sophisticated automation that justifies their premium pricing. But honestly, most teams should start smaller and scale into these tools rather than buying them upfront.Your competitors are already using these tools. The question isn't whether to invest in affiliate recruitment technology - it's whether you can afford not to. The gap between companies actively recruiting proven affiliates and those hoping affiliates find them is growing wider every month, and the tools that create that gap are all listed above.Affiliate recruitment tools like AffiliateFinder.ai actively find affiliates by scanning the web for competitors' partners, while networks like ShareASale are marketplaces where you list programs and wait for affiliates to apply.Yes, most recruitment tools focus only on discovery and contact finding, so you'll need tracking software like Endorsely, Impact, or Tapfiliate to manage commissions and performance tracking.AffiliateFinder.ai typically saves 15-20 hours weekly by automating competitor research and contact finding that would take days of manual work to accomplish with the same quality.Options exist for every budget: Endorsely starts completely free, AffiliateFinder.ai costs $99 monthly, while enterprise tools like GRIN run $1,000+ monthly depending on program scale and needs.Most successful programs use one primary discovery tool like AffiliateFinder.ai plus free supplementary tools like Partnerbase for additional intelligence and marketplaces like Refersion for passive recruitment.Track time-to-recruit, affiliate quality (measured by conversion rates), and program growth velocity. Successful tools should cut recruitment time by 50%+ while improving partner quality significantly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest news bulletin | October 31st, 2025 – Morning</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BVGgi-wBZw</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2BVGgi-wBZw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:17:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Latest news bulletin | October 31st, 2025 – Morning

Every loan application runs through connected systems that analyze payment patterns, income data, and digital behavior in real time.Traditional credit bureaus still anchor the system, but they no longer hold a monopoly on financial identity. New data sources, from rent and utility payments to digital wallet activity now influence eligibility.Alternative data networks are opening new doors. Rent, utilities, and digital wallet patterns now shape credit profiles for millions who were once invisible to lenders.Decision engines read your financial rhythm. Through open-banking APIs like Plaid, Finicity, and Yodlee, lenders analyze income and spending in real time to gauge stability.AI underwriting learns as it lends. Machine learning layers behavioral cues, biometrics, and predictive analytics to refine risk models, raising new questions about fairness and bias.Buy Now, Pay Later data is reshaping credit history. Repayment activity from platforms such as Affirm and Klarna now feeds back into major reporting systems, influencing how trust is built.In 2025, creditworthiness is a moving signal. Understanding how these data networks connect is key to building faster, fairer, and more transparent access to finance.The Invisible System Behind Every LoanEvery loan decision in America now starts with data. Before a human ever looks at an application, algorithms have already parsed a borrower’s history, payments, and even digital behavior. What used to be a snapshot of credit has become a live feed, a constantly updated record of financial trust.According to Experian’s 2023 State of Alternative Credit Data Report, 62% of financial institutions surveyed reported current or planned use of expanded data for risk profiling. This marks a clear shift away from static credit scoring and toward real-time, data-driven verification.Behind that feed sits an ecosystem much larger than the three credit bureaus we know by name. Dozens of companies now specialize in alternative data, digital verification, and predictive modeling, each one shaping how risk is measured.In this networked system, your financial identity moves faster than you do. Every rent payment, late bill, or new account echoes through databases that talk to one another in real time. Those signals determine not only whether you’re approved, but how much you’ll pay to borrow.For consumers with limited or uneven credit history, understanding that invisible system isn’t optional, but it’s truly become the first step toward seeing how credit really works in 2025.The Legacy System Still Sets the BenchmarkFor decades, three credit bureaus, namely Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, have defined how risk is measured in the United States. They collect records on everything from payment history to credit limits and defaults, creating the data backbone that powers most lending models. Nearly every loan decision still starts with a pull from at least one of these sources, filtered through scoring formulas like FICO or VantageScore.Each bureau operates its own network, which means your score can fluctuate depending on who’s checking. Credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, and auto finance companies feed data back into these systems every month, reinforcing a cycle that’s both precise and narrow. When a lender talks about “creditworthiness,” they’re referring to this data loop, a closed system built on reported borrowing behavior.But that loop leaves a blind spot. Traditional credit models rely on a small set of signals: cards, loans, and payment timelines. For millions of Americans without those records, the result is the same: no score, no access. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 26 million Americans are “credit invisible,” and another 19 million have unscorable files, roughly 45 million consumers who may be denied access to mainstream credit.Some analysts argue that this dependence on decades-old infrastructure limits innovation and inclusion, prompting a gradual shift toward more decentralized, data-rich verification systems. That change is what gave rise to today’s alternative-data ecosystem: a new layer of financial intelligence designed to measure trust where traditional systems see nothing at all.Alternative Data Is Redrawing the Credit MapFor millions of borrowers with limited credit history, traditional scores don’t tell the full story. Payment habits, rent records, and recurring bills often reveal more about financial reliability than a single credit card statement ever could. That’s where alternative data networks step in , systems designed to read signals that old models ignore. in this space include:LexisNexis Risk Solutions: Builds financial profiles from public records, utility accounts, and identity data.: Tracks short-term and payday lending activity.: Deliver real-time feeds of subprime credit performance.Together, they form a parallel data layer: one that measures consistency, not just credit access.Some of these networks connect through specialized reporting systems such as Teletrack, a platform that compiles alternative credit data from non-prime lenders. For readers wondering “?”: It’s a consumer reporting agency now owned by Equifax that gathers information from short-term and subprime lenders, including payday loan history, employment records, and payment behavior. Unlike traditional credit bureaus, Teletrack focuses specifically on high-risk or limited-credit borrowers, helping lenders identify repayment patterns and risk profiles that fall outside standard credit models.Although this information doesn’t always reach the major bureaus, it increasingly feeds into approval algorithms. By mapping spending and repayment behavior across nontraditional channels, from rent to cash-app transfers, these providers extend visibility to borrowers who were previously excluded from mainstream finance.Lenders Rely on Aggregated Decision EnginesBefore a loan is approved or denied, the decision rarely comes from a single score. Modern underwriting runs on decision engines with systems that pull live data from multiple sources, apply algorithms, and return a credit decision in seconds. These engines have become the invisible core of digital lending, translating a borrower’s financial activity into probability models of repayment.How Decision Engines Actually WorkInstead of relying on one bureau report, lenders feed a mix of inputs into a unified model: Traditional score files remain part of the stack, but they’re blended with live transaction and behavioral data to create a fuller picture of financial health. Employment data, bank-verified deposits, or gig-economy pay stubs. Recurring subscriptions, rent, and utilities. Payment timing, cash-flow predictability, or spending volatility.Each data type is weighted by an algorithm trained to balance risk, profitability, and inclusion. The result isn’t a score but a decision probability, and how likely an applicant is to repay within a given time horizon.The shift to real-time decisioning is powered by open-banking APIs. Platforms like Plaid, Yodlee, and Finicity connect directly to applicants’ bank accounts through secure data pipes.They confirm income consistency and identify sudden balance drops or irregular deposits.They flag recurring bills or overdrafts, turning raw transactions into dynamic financial profiles.They replace static statements with live telemetry of cash flow.According to a 2025 ScienceDirect study, fintech firms are increasingly using these platforms to access customer bank data for underwriting, even in markets without full open-banking regulation. Meanwhile, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston describes how open-banking APIs now serve as “central hubs” in financial networks, enabling the secure, consumer-authorized transfer of account data.This live connectivity has become a defining feature of 2025-era lending: underwriting based on what a borrower is doing now, not what they did months ago.Advanced Technologies Behind the Decision LayerDecision engines increasingly use machine learning to update credit models in real time. Platforms can analyze thousands of signals per applicant, from income stability to behavioral biometrics, to detect both opportunity and risk.Geolocation and device fingerprinting help verify identity and prevent synthetic-fraud attacks. track subtle user patterns, such as typing rhythm or navigation speed, to distinguish legitimate users from bots. continually retrain models, improving accuracy as new repayment data arrives.As AI Magazine reports, companies like Zest AI are enabling “fair and transparent lending” by automating credit assessments and using explainable models to improve both speed and inclusion.The goal isn’t only faster decisions, but it’s smarter inclusion. Each data point refines how risk is measured, letting more people qualify without loosening standards.The Algorithmic Middle Layer of LendingIn many institutions, these decision engines now form a new operational layer, sitting between human underwriters and legacy credit bureaus. They interpret incoming data, flag anomalies, and feed insights back to both compliance and risk teams.This algorithmic middle layer is what allows fintech lenders to scale: decisions that once took days now happen in seconds, with audit trails and explainability dashboards built in.The rise of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) platforms has added a new layer to consumer credit finance. Services have extended short-term credit at the point of sale, effectively creating micro-loans that bypass traditional revolving accounts. For years, these transactions existed outside the major credit bureaus, but that’s changing fast.Some BNPL providers now share repayment data with bureaus that enables users to build or repair credit profiles through consistent on-time payments. This gradual shift is redefining what counts as “credit history” in the modern ecosystem.What makes BNPL data so valuable is its behavioral precision. Platforms track not just repayment, but timing, frequency, and transaction context, how often users finance purchases, and how quickly they settle them. Combined with predictive analytics, these insights feed into the same decision engines that power digital lending.According to the CFPB, in 2022 more than one‐fifth of U.S. consumers with a credit record used BNPL financing, and regulatory scrutiny is rising as policymakers push for standardized reporting to improve transparency.As data-sharing expands, the boundary between BNPL and traditional finance continues to blur, connecting previously invisible spending patterns to the wider credit system. For millions of consumers, that connection marks the difference between invisibility and eligibility.The New Architecture of CreditThe evolution of consumer credit finance is no longer about a single score. It’s about data architecture, a living system where real-time signals replace static records, and inclusion depends on visibility, not legacy.Traditional credit bureaus still define much of the infrastructure, but they now operate within a larger, decentralized web that includes alternative data providers, open-banking APIs, and AI-driven decision engines. Each node in that network, whether it’s a Teletrack record, an income-verification feed, or a BNPL repayment, contributes a data point to a growing portrait of financial trust.This interconnectedness is reshaping both sides of lending. For lenders, it means sharper risk intelligence and faster approvals. For consumers, it means that every verified action like every rent payment, utility bill, or BNPL installment, can become part of a transparent financial identity.Credit has become a network effect, and understanding that network of who collects, connects, and calculates your data, is now the first step toward unlocking smarter, fairer access to finance in 2025 and beyond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Low voter turnout, protests, crackdowns: Are elections in Africa eroding trust in democracy?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFlFsoPbbQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_TFlFsoPbbQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 05:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After a steady clip of elections on the Continent, incumbent leaders have tightened their grip on power.

Also known as the American Revolutionary War, 2025 marks 250 years since the start of the conflict in 1775, when the first battles between the British army and the colonial resistance were fought at Lexington and Concord. But what caused Britain’s North American colonies to rebel against the king and government in London? At what point did they start to see themselves as American and not British? And how did a colonial militia take on an imperial superpower?This episode charts the growing rift between Britain and its American colonists, taking in famous events like the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party and the calling of the first Continental Congress, all the way through to the Declaration of Independence and the course of the revolutionary war itself. We learn how America fought to free itself from the shackles of British rule, and meet some well-known names from history, including Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin and George Washington. And we also ask whose freedom was being fought for, and who – such as Black and Indigenous Americans – got left behind.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

The leak follows others obtained and verified by 404 Media over the last 18 months. Those leaks impacted both Cellebrite and its competitor Grayshift, now owned by Magnet Forensics. Both companies constantly hunt for techniques to unlock phones law enforcement have physical access to.
 
"You can Teams meeting with them. They tell everything. Still cannot extract esim on Pixel. Ask anything," a user called rogueFed wrote on the GrapheneOS forum on Wednesday, speaking about what they learned about Cellebrite capabilities. GrapheneOS is a security- and privacy-focused Android-based operating system. rogueFed then posted two screenshots of the Microsoft Teams call. The first was a Cellebrite Support Matrix, which lays out whether the company's tech can, or can't, unlock certain phones and under what conditions. The second screenshot was of a Cellebrite employee. According to another of rogueFed's posts, the meeting took place in October. The meeting appears to have been a sales call. The employee is a "pre sales expert," according to a profile available online.
 
The Support Matrix is focused on modern Google Pixel devices, including the Pixel 9 series. The screenshot does not include details on the Pixel 10, which is Google's latest device. It discusses Cellebrite's capabilities regarding 'before first unlock', or BFU, when a piece of phone unlocking tech tries to open a device before someone has typed in the phone's passcode for the first time since being turned on. It also shows Cellebrite's capabilities against after first unlock, or AFU, devices. The Support Matrix also shows Cellebrite's capabilities against Pixel devices running GrapheneOS, with some differences between phones running that operating system and stock Android. Cellebrite does support, for example, Pixel 9 devices BFU. Meanwhile the screenshot indicates Cellebrite cannot unlock Pixel 9 devices running GrapheneOS BFU. In their forum post, rogueFed wrote that the "meeting focused specific on GrapheneOS bypass capability." They added "very fresh info more coming."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD could enter ARM market with Sound Wave APU built on TSMC 3nm process</title><link>https://www.guru3d.com/story/amd-enters-arm-market-with-sound-wave-apu-built-on-tsmc-3nm-process/</link><author>walterbell</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 03:07:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AMD is expanding its processor portfolio beyond the x86 architecture with its first ARM-based APU, internally known as “Sound Wave.” The chip’s existence was uncovered through customs import records, confirming several details about its design and purpose. Built with a BGA-1074 package measuring 32 mm × 27 mm, the processor fits within standard mobile SoC dimensions, making it suitable for thin and light computing platforms. It employs a 0.8 mm pitch and FF5 interface, replacing the FF3 socket previously used in Valve’s Steam handheld devices, further hinting at a new generation of compact AMD-powered hardware.
                                    According to leaks from industry insiders such as @Moore’s Law Is Dead and @KeplerL2, “Sound Wave” is manufactured on  and aims for a  range, positioning it directly against Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite.

The court order was issued pending the Supreme Court’s decision to rule on the matter. And because this administration is a walking, talking clown show, the information that SCOTUS is getting on the matter is hilariously stratified depending on who they’re talking to.President Donald Trump‘s administration has told the U.S. Supreme Court he needs to deploy National Guard troops to the Chicago area in part because local police have failed to respond to what the Justice Department described as mob violence by people protesting his aggressive immigration enforcement.Those law enforcement agencies have given the nine justices a starkly different account of protests they called limited in scale, detailing in court filings how they have responded on specific dates and explaining how a unified command they set up to coordinate efforts dealt effectively with the demonstrations.In other words, the Trump administration is pleading the court to let it send armed troops into the third largest city in the country to protect the very people who are essentially telling the court, “Meh, we’re fine.”That won’t stop Trump, obviously, because this was never really about safety in cities or protecting federal agents. This is purely about pushing to see just how much this administration can get away with and, to go tinfoil hat on you for a moment, to begin putting the chess pieces on the right parts of the board come election time. Major city after major city will see the attempted deployment of armed forces. Trump recently stated that he will send “more than the National Guard” if needed. I’ve seen . I know how this works.So, what protects us from whatever Trump’s version of “checkmate” is? Multiple things, to be sure. Popular uprising. Overcoming whatever obstacles he constructs in the midterm elections. Organizational efforts to undermine his lawless activity wherever possible.Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump’s controversial immigration enforcement mission — a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.“It’s disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,” said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois’s 13th District. “It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.”Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops – including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard – to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.“I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,” Blaha said. “When we have somebody in power who’s actively dismantling our rights — free speech, due process, freedom of the press — it’s really hard to be a soldier right now.”Some of this isn’t new. In other cities, we’ve had National Guard members displeased with their use as political pawns in mission-less deployments to patrol peaceful cities. But I’m unaware thus far of any instances of them actually refusing orders. Such a refusal, should the order be ultimately deemed lawful, would be grounds for discharge, imprisonment, and so on. It’s a big freaking deal and would generate a ton of attention.Which is  why it needs to happen. Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely. I would definitely say no,” she said. “I’m not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.”“Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,” Blaha said. “There is a point where if you didn’t stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?”It’s worse than that. Nazi Germany didn’t have social media, cell phone cameras, or the internet by which all of this chaos can be shared in real time. Whatever sins the German people committed by failing to stop Hitler’s party when they could, and they very much did commit those sins, it’s  true that the average German wasn’t nearly as informed as to what the Nazis were doing compared with the access to information that the American people have today. No soldier can claim ignorance. If they participate, they are knowingly complicit, full stop.The scary part is how unfortunately rare this sort of bravery is in the military. In fact, it seems many in the military are fully embracing Trump’s fascistic tendencies.Both Blaha and Palecek said they’ve faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. “They twisted my words,” he said. “I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.”Retribution, Palecek added, is “real.” She’s received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. “It weighs on you mentally after a while,” she said.Still, both say silence is not an option. “We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,” Blaha said.And stand up for the Constitution, too. Look, it must be very difficult to be a good person in the National Guard right now. You just never know when you’re going to be asked to do battle with your fellow Americans. But an oath is an oath and we should all expect, not just hope, our soldiers to behave like patriots.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John Carmack on mutable variables</title><link>https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1983593511703474196</link><author>azhenley</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 02:34:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ground stop at JFK due to staffing</title><link>https://www.fly.faa.gov/adv/adv_otherdis?advn=13&amp;adv_date=10312025&amp;facId=JFK&amp;title=ATCSCC%20ADVZY%20013%20JFK/ZNY%2010/31/2025%20CDM%20GROUND%20STOP&amp;titleDate=10/31/2025</link><author>akersten</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 01:48:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mathematical Proof Debunks the Idea That the Universe Is a Computer Simulation</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/10/30/2232258/mathematical-proof-debunks-the-idea-that-the-universe-is-a-computer-simulation?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[alternative_right shares a report from Phys.org: Today's cutting-edge theory -- quantum gravity -- suggests that even space and time aren't fundamental. They emerge from something deeper: pure information. This information exists in what physicists call a Platonic realm -- a mathematical foundation more real than the physical universe we experience. It's from this realm that space and time themselves emerge. "The fundamental laws of physics cannot be contained within space and time, because they generate them. It has long been hoped, however, that a truly fundamental theory of everything could eventually describe all physical phenomena through computations grounded in these laws. Yet we have demonstrated that this is not possible. A complete and consistent description of reality requires something deeper -- a form of understanding known as non-algorithmic understanding." "We have demonstrated that it is impossible to describe all aspects of physical reality using a computational theory of quantum gravity," says Dr. Faizal. "Therefore, no physically complete and consistent theory of everything can be derived from computation alone. Rather, it requires a non-algorithmic understanding, which is more fundamental than the computational laws of quantum gravity and therefore more fundamental than spacetime itself."
 
"Drawing on mathematical theorems related to incompleteness and indefinability, we demonstrate that a fully consistent and complete description of reality cannot be achieved through computation alone," explains Dr. Mir Faizal, Adjunct Professor with UBC Okanagan's Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science. "It requires non-algorithmic understanding, which by definition is beyond algorithmic computation and therefore cannot be simulated. Hence, this universe cannot be a simulation."
 
The findings have been published in the Journal of Holography Applications in Physics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ICE and the Smartphone Panopticon</title><link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/ice-and-the-smartphone-panopticon</link><author>fortran77</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 01:13:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, as  raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless documentation has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of ; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping  agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J. B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti- opposition is taking advantage of the internet,  and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent  sweeps of the area.  itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet  found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in ,  also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown  agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where  agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of  abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an  field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Myths Programmers Believe about CPU Caches (2018)</title><link>https://software.rajivprab.com/2018/04/29/myths-programmers-believe-about-cpu-caches/</link><author>whack</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:46:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[distributed-system-architecturedatabase-isolation-levelsstrong-vs-eventual consistencyvolatilesread/written all the way to main memoryeven single-core systems are at risk of concurrency bugsgreat wealth of nuancethis tutorialMESI protocolThe state of the cache-line is set to M, since it is now modifiedmulti-processor systemimmediately trigger cache reads/writes instead]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Shows Off Prototype Android XR Glasses From Extended Magic Leap Deal</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/0021217/google-shows-off-prototype-android-xr-glasses-from-extended-magic-leap-deal?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google and Magic Leap have extended their partnership for another three years to develop Android XR glasses. They also showed off a new prototype concept that combines Google's Raxium microLED light engine with Magic Leap's AR optics, resulting in a lightweight, stylish pair of glasses that blends real-world vision with multimodal AI. 9to5Google reports: As noted by Android Central, a press release shared by Magic Leap adds some further technical details. This includes mentioning that Google's "Raxium microLED light engine" integrates with Magic Leap's tech to bring "digital content seamlessly into the world." As pictured above, the "display" portion of the lens is visible at some angles, but it's largely impossible to see.
 
Magic Leap and Google will show an AI glasses prototype at FII that will serve as a prototype and reference design for the Android XR ecosystem. The demo shows how Magic Leap's technology, integrated with Google's Raxium microLED light engine, brings digital content seamlessly into the world. The prototypes worn on stage illustrate how comfortable, stylish smart eyewear is possible and the video showed the potential for users to stay present in the real world while tapping into the knowledge and functionality of multimodal AI.
 
During the presentation, text on the nearby screens suggests that Magic Leap is mainly working with Google on the technology here, rather than bringing its own glasses to market. Magic Leap further hints at this in its press release, calling itself "an AR ecosystem partner" focused on "supporting global technology leaders that want to enter the AR market and accelerate the production of AR glasses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Quibbler – A critic for your coding agent that learns what you want</title><link>https://github.com/fulcrumresearch/quibbler</link><author>etherio</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:43:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How other countries might react to Trump&apos;s nuclear weapons testing plans | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNexJUpw_OE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JNexJUpw_OE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:30:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The world might be a little bit closer to catastrophe today, after President Trump announced that he'd ordered the Pentagon to restart its nuclear weapons testing program, after a break of more than 30 years. He said the tests are necessary to keep pace with China and Russia. 

In a statement published online, Donald Trump wrote: "Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately."

If so, you may have heard of the ancient tradition of keening or the superstition of the 'hungry grass'. In this episode, Dan is joined by the hosts of the After Dark podcast, Dr Anthony Delaney and Dr Maddy Pelling, to explore some of the historic rites and beliefs surrounding death and mourning in Ireland. Anthony explains the role of 'keening women' - once persecuted by the government and the church - who would wail and lament at the graveside (and air any mistakes the deceased may have made) as well as the procession down the 'corpse road' and the customs of covering mirrors and opening the window at the point of death.Warning: this episode has an instance of explicit language.Produced by Freddy Chick and edited by Matthew Wilson and Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Genode-Powered Sculpt OS 25.10 Brings Performance Improvements &amp; Better Drivers</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Sculpt-OS-25.10-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:22:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Genode operating system framework continues innovating over a decade and a half later on this original open-source OS creation and with that Sculpt OS as its general purpose OS.

It's unclear who's running the campaign, but a blog post on the free Android app store F-Droid is directing users to visit the campaign's website, which urges the public to lobby government regulators to intervene and stop the upcoming restrictions. "Developers should have the right to create and distribute software without submitting to unnecessary corporate surveillance," reads an open letter posted to the site. [...]
 
Google has described the upcoming change as akin to requiring app developers to go through "an ID check at the airport." However, F-Droid condemned the new requirement as anti-consumer choice. "If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs you want on it," it says. Additionally, the rules threaten third-party app distribution on F-Droid, which operates as a "free/open-source app distribution" model.
 
In its blog post, F-Droid warns about the impact on users and Android app developers. "You, the creator, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with your friends, family, and community without first seeking Google's approval," the app store says. "Over half of all humankind uses an Android smartphone," the blog post adds. "Google does not own your phone. You own your phone. You have the right to decide who to trust, and where you can get your software from."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>31/10/2025 Box Office Top Ten</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di52CgeyKfs</link><author>Kermode and Mayo&apos;s Take</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/di52CgeyKfs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:01:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErmMCK1sHF-kCtyHpuSXtQ">Movies - Kermode</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#MarkKermode #SimonMayo #FilmReviews

The demand, which would require Google and Amazon to effectively sidestep legal obligations in countries around the world, was born out of Israel's concerns that data it moves into the global corporations' cloud platforms could end up in the hands of foreign law enforcement authorities.
 
Like other big tech companies, Google and Amazon's cloud businesses routinely comply with requests from police, prosecutors and security services to hand over customer data to assist investigations. This process is often cloaked in secrecy. The companies are frequently gagged from alerting the affected customer their information has been turned over. This is either because the law enforcement agency has the power to demand this or a court has ordered them to stay silent. For Israel, losing control of its data to authorities overseas was a significant concern. So to deal with the threat, officials created a secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.
 
To clinch the lucrative contract, Google and Amazon agreed to the so-called winking mechanism, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian, as part of a joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call. Based on the documents and descriptions of the contract by Israeli officials, the investigation reveals how the companies bowed to a series of stringent and unorthodox "controls" contained within the 2021 deal, known as Project Nimbus. Both Google and Amazon's cloud businesses have denied evading any legal obligations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Leaker reveals which Pixels are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/</link><author>akyuu</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 23:12:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Taiwan is relieved about the outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZvCECuRNGM</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VZvCECuRNGM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 23:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump says he's reducing tariffs on Chinese imports from 57 to 47 percent.

Wise is a financial service that lets you send and receive money across currencies, often at a better rate and lower fee than traditional banks. Sounds great, right?This is our story – a sobering, frustrating, and frankly  experience that ended with our business and personal accounts being shut down, without any meaningful reason, support, or recourse.And all we did? We .🏢 A Routine Change Turned NightmareLike many businesses, we recently moved into a new office. Alongside the usual updates to suppliers and records, we updated our  with Wise. Not long after, we received an email requesting us to  the new address.Fair enough – we had no problem with that.Wise provided a dropdown list of acceptable documents: a lease agreement, rates notice, tax document, utilities bill, or telecommunications bill. Due to our company structure, most of those documents are in the name of our parent company or show our PO Box (which NZ Post requires, since they won’t deliver to our street address). But we had a  that ticked every box:Correct physical street address ✅Even detailed our fibre connection at the new premises ✅So we uploaded it – and assumed that would be the end of it.📞 The Call That Made No SenseDays later, we received an email: our document was . No clear reason. So, I called Wise and explained the situation to the customer service representative.Her response left me stunned.“The document was rejected because it was a , not a .”I paused, trying to process this. I politely explained that in New Zealand, a “tax invoice” is a legal form of a bill – even down to the name “tax invoice” being a legal requirement by IRD, and that’s how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.“It needs to say  at the top,” she insisted.“A tax invoice isn’t acceptable.”This is simply , and completely out of touch with New Zealand’s business documentation standards. The rep wouldn’t budge.🧠 The “Solution” That Was Beyond BeliefStill trying to find a solution, I asked: what do you recommend I do then?“You should find a local shared workspace, lease a desk under your company name, change your registered office to that address, and use that lease document to verify your address with us.”Yes, you read that right.Wise’s advice was to artificially lease a desk we didn’t need, change our registered address, and use that document – just to verify an address we actually operate from.I asked to speak to a manager. That request was . She told me, flatly:“I  providing you with the correct information.”A bit more back and forth… then the call .📞 A Glimmer of Hope – Then The Hammer FallsLater that day, I received a call back from Wise – not from a manager (because apparently, Wise doesn’t have managers), but from a more “senior” representative.This rep was  and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she’d personally follow up if it was rejected again.🚫 “We’ve Restricted Your Account”I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:“We’ve restricted your account”Just like that, our  was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:“Due to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.”Even worse? My  was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.🧾 An “Appeal” That Wasn’t an AppealThe email offered an option to . Naturally, I did.The appeal process asked for our articles of incorporation and . No problem.Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and bank account details to refund the balances.Wait… I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?That was the end. There was no opportunity to explain anything, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were , permanently.To summarise the absurdity of this:We moved office, and updated our address with WiseWe provided a legal, NZ-compliant  showing our entity and addressIt was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different documentA senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated itThen our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourseEven trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very CarefulWe had used Wise for . Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that , with no transparency or logical path to resolution.We’re not alone – a quick search shows many others facing similar horror stories with Wise.So this is my word of warning:💡 Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths.🧾 28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to  as we had breached their acceptable use policy. 🤨What was surprising, however, was the  they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:I was told my  was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states “you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”I’ve  used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”What activities?! Again, To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer . Why? Because it requires documentation — the  Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill.After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.So now our , their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to Financial Services Complaints Ltd, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Universal Partners With AI Startup Udio After Settling Copyright Suit</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/10/30/2156200/universal-partners-with-ai-startup-udio-after-settling-copyright-suit?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 22:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Universal Music Group has settled its copyright lawsuit with AI music startup Udio and struck a licensing deal to launch a new AI-powered music platform next year. The Verge reports: The deal includes some form of compensation and "will provide further revenue opportunities for UMG artists and songwriters," Universal says. Udio, the company behind "BBL Drizzy," will launch the platform as a subscription service next year. Universal, alongside other industry giants Sony and Warner, sued Udio and another startup Suno for "en masse" copyright infringement last year.
 
Universal -- whose roster includes some of the world's biggest performers like Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Ariana Grande -- says the new tool will "transform the user engagement experience" and let creators customize, stream, and share music. There's no indication of how much it will cost yet. Udio's existing music maker, which lets you create new songs with a few words, will remain available during the transition, though content will be held "within a walled garden" and security measures like fingerprinting will be added.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Age Verification, Estimation, Assurance, Oh My!

It follows a recent corporate restructuring that loosened its dependence on Microsoft and aligned its nonprofit foundation with financial success. Reuters reports: OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026, some of the people said. In preliminary discussions, the company has looked at raising $60 billion at the low end and likely more, the people said. They cautioned that talks are early and plans -- including the figures and timing - could change depending on business growth and market conditions. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing, the people said. But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026.
 
[...] An IPO would open the door to more efficient capital raising and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping to finance CEO Sam Altman's plans to pour trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. With an annualized revenue run rate expected to reach about $20 billion by year-end, losses are also mounting inside the $500 billion company, the people said. During a livestream on Tuesday, Altman addressed the possibility of going public. "I think it's fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we'll have," he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Election unrest in Tanzania | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WAwwTSP6V9I</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WAwwTSP6V9I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 22:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/

Earlier in its European Council presidency, Denmark had brought back a draft law which would have required the scanning, sparking an intense backlash. Known as Chat Control, the measure was intended to crack down on the trafficking of child sex abuse materials (CSAM).  After days of silence, the German government on October 8 announced it would not support the proposal, tanking the Danish effort.  Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told reporters on Thursday that his office will support voluntary CSAM detections.  "This will mean that the search warrant will not be part of the EU presidency's new compromise proposal, and that it will continue to be voluntary for the tech giants to search for child sexual abuse material," Hummelgaard said, according to local news reports.  The current model allowing for voluntary scanning expires in April, Hummelgaard said.  "Right now we are in a situation where we risk completely losing a central tool in the fight against sexual abuse of children,” he said. "That's why we have to act no matter what. We owe it to all the children who are subjected to monstrous abuse."   Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, lobbied hard against the original measure, saying the organization would leave the European market if the provision was adopted.  “What they propose is in effect a mass surveillance free-for-all, opening up everyone’s intimate and confidential communications, whether government officials, military, investigative journalists, or activists,” she said at the time. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Tale of Silyan | Official Trailer | National Geographic Documentary Films</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14xo8s-0kU4</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/14xo8s-0kU4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 21:27:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A down-on-his luck farmer develops a unique bond with a wounded white stork as he nurses the bird back to health.

The flaw, reports The Register, exploits the absence of rate limiting on document.title API updates in Chromium versions 143.0.7483.0 and later. The attack injects millions of DOM mutations per second and saturates the main thread. When The Register tested the code on Edge, the browser crashed and the Windows machine locked up after about 30 seconds while consuming 18GB of RAM in one tab.

The War Department has its own Ministry of Truth, staffed by people whose organizations have seen their fortunes rise along with Trump’s. The bootlicking was always there. The only change is that it’s now officially state-sanctioned. The administration doesn’t care how this looks. It only cares that it got what it wants. Not only did it break with tradition by demanding journalists agree to play by the administration’s rules if they wanted access to the Pentagon and military officials, it broke with tradition by proudly proclaiming its victory over the First Amendment on the social media platform most devoted to stifling criticism of authoritarians: Nearly one week since a rash of Pentagon journalists turned in their press credentials after refusing to sign a new restrictive press policy, the Defense Department announced a “new media” press corps, largely hailing from right-wing outlets.The 60 people from various news organizations represent, “a broad spectrum of new media outlets and independent journalists,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote in a statement Wednesday on X, adding that all of the publications agreed to the agency’s press policy.There’s a lot to be appalled by/mock endlessly going on here. First, there’s the fact that this plan will be carried out by other federal agencies since it worked out perfectly here. Second, there’s no “broad spectrum” here, unless you consider multiple people saying the same things with the same pro-Trump deference a hot new take on journalistic freedom. Then there are the people generously being called “journalists” by a man speaking for an agency being concurrently fellated by at least a couple of dozen extremely right-wing publications. No one would call these people “journalists,” perhaps not even those being called “journalists” by the DoD spokesman. Brace yourself. It gets ugly immediately.According to a draft of the announcement obtained by The Washington Post ahead of Parnell’s tweet, the coalition of signatories includes the cable network Real America’s Voice, streaming service Lindell TV (started by MyPillow CEO and Trump ally Mike Lindell), the websites the Gateway Pundit, the Post Millennial, Human Events, the National Pulse, and RedState. It also includes Turning Point USA’s media brand Frontlines, as well as influencer Tim Pool’s Timcast, and a Substack-based newsletter called Washington Reporter.While the Defense Department was proud to announce it had ousted actual journalists from the Pentagon, it was a bit more cagey when it came to naming the ones who decided to stick around. Parnell bragged on X, but actual journalists had to ask some questions to come up with a list of those who swore an oath of fealty to Papa  Don or whatever the fuck it is we’re calling Donald Trump these days. What’s more surprising is the list of people who left. I’m not talking about the expected ex-pats or the ones already kicked out by the Pentagon (NPR, New York Times). I’m talking about Trump proxies like Newsmax, Fox News, and the Daily Caller. These outlets — despite spending most of their time ensuring the administration always has a bullhorn to borrow — also thought the Pentagon’s demands were inappropriate, which left only the weirdest and worst of the right wing media in place to do the government’s bidding.And this demand was even too much for one writer who worked for a right wing outlet that has spent the Trump years (which includes the Biden years) further distancing itself from anything that could be considered credible reporting — the Epoch Times — found both the DoD demand and his (now former) employer’s concession too much to stomach: A national security reporter at the right-wing Epoch Times newspaper has resigned after the publication signed on to rules restricting news gathering within the Pentagon.The reporter, Andrew Thornebrooke, submitted his resignation in writing on Friday. Although he did not have an active Pentagon press pass, he regularly covered issues related to the Defense Department and frequently reported from the cavernous military complex while working at the publication.In his resignation email, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Thornebrooke called The Epoch Times’s signing of the pledge a choice to “abdicate our responsibility as journalists in favor of merely repeating state narratives.”Thornebrooke also took issue with an editorial directive to refer to antifa as a “terrorist organization” despite there being no evidence it’s an “organization” (rather than an ideological movement), much less involved in terrorism. This is censorship that isn’t even pretending to be something else. The public statements declaring a new “press” corp are just a victory lap by brutish people who have the audacity to claim they have the moral high ground while shitting all over the rights their predecessors fought and died for. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s Inside an NES? #nintendo #retrogaming #electronics #retrotech</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pY19bdyzgco</link><author>NesHacker</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pY19bdyzgco?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 21:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXR5PCyUI2pG_a3ydnCIS-g">NesHacker</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Support the channel: https://patreon.com/NesHacker]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Social media clips show RSF atrocities in Darfur | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cnnUyVWs-a8</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cnnUyVWs-a8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 21:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Harrowing videos from El-Fasher in Darfur are spreading on social media.

From a report: "Engineers just cannot make good content," Lee said during a Wednesday interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 "There's a bunch of shallow replicas, but I challenge you to find one video you think is like, 'Yo, this is as tough as Cluely,'" he told TechCrunch. 

Every startup needs to focus more on distribution. And most startups flop because they fail to get seen, even if they have product-market fit, Lee said. Cluely launched earlier this year as a tool to help software engineers cheat on their job interviews, among other use cases. The startup earlier this year posted a tongue-in-cheek video of Lee trying to use Cluely to impress a woman on a date, which went viral.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple reports fourth quarter results</title><link>https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/</link><author>mfiguiere</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:34:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the rebel-held mines in eastern Congo that help power your smartphone</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/inside-the-rebel-held-mines-in-eastern-congo-that-help-power-your-smartphone</link><author>Jamal Osman</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:15:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rebels have captured vast areas of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.That land, controlled by the M23 movement, is rich in critical minerals which the rest of the world is desperate to get its hands on.It’s a scramble involving the US, China and tech giants which is helping fuel a devastating conflict.Channel 4 News was granted access to the coltan mine near the Rubaya, where impoverished locals  seek a mineral CRUCIAL for making our smartphones.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RSF pledges to take action against fighters guilty of war crimes in Sudan</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/rsf-pledges-to-take-action-against-fighters-guilty-of-war-crimes-in-sudan</link><author>Jonathan Rugman</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:10:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After video evidence of summary executions of civilians in Sudan drew widespread condemnation, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces claim they will take action against their own fighters who are guilty of war crimes.After the fall of the city of el-Fasher, RSF fighters are accused of going on a killing rampage;

Dan Snow joins After Dark with Anthony Delaney and Maddy Pelling to chat about the brutal reality of sailing in the Age of Sail. They explore the horrifying life at sea for a Royal Navy sailor from the 16th to 19th century, covering the truth about press ganging, shipboard discipline, and the myths vs. realities of naval life.

Dan details the real killers at sea, revealing that more sailors died from disease like scurvy and in catastrophic shipwrecks than in famous naval battles. The conversation also covers the cosmopolitan nature of the crews, the horrors of naval combat, the complex truth about pirates, and what it really took to survive in Nelson's Navy.

New Zealand may soon follow, and Denmark’s prime minister recently declared her country would ban social media for under-15s, accusing mobile phones and social networks of “stealing our children’s childhood”.At first glance, these policies appear to be about protecting young people from mental health harm, explicit content and addictive design. But beneath the language of safety lies something else: a shift in cultural values.The bans reflect a kind of moral turn, one that risks reviving conservative notions that predate the internet. Might we be entering a new Victorian era of the internet, where the digital lives of young people are reshaped not just by regulation but by a reassertion of moral control?The Victorian era was marked by rigid social codes, modest dress and formal communication. Public behaviour was tightly regulated, and schools were seen as key sites for socialising children into gender and class hierarchies.Today, we see echoes of this in the way “digital wellness” is framed. Screen-time apps, detox retreats and “dumb” phones are marketed as tools for cultivating a “healthy” digital life – often with moral undertones. The ideal user is calm, focused and restrained. The impulsive, distracted or emotionally expressive user is pathologised.This framing is especially evident in the work of Jonathan Haidt, psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation, a central text in the age-restriction movement. Haidt argues that social media accelerates performative behaviour and emotional dysregulation in young people.Viewed this way, youth digital life involves declining psychological resilience, rising polarisation and the erosion of shared civic values, rather than being a symptom of complex developmental or technological shifts. This has helped popularise the idea that social media is not just harmful but corrupting.For example, while some research links heavy social media use to anxiety and depression, other studies suggest the effects are modest and vary widely depending on context, platform and individual differences.What’s missing from much of the debate is a recognition of young people’s agency, or their ability to navigate online spaces intelligently, creatively and socially.Indeed, youth digital life is not just about passive consumption. It’s a site of literacy, expression and connection. Platforms such as TikTok and YouTube have fostered a renaissance of oral and visual communication.Young people stitch together memes, remix videos and engage in rapid-fire editing to produce new forms of storytelling. These are not signs of decline but evolving literacies. To regulate youth access without acknowledging these skills risks suppressing the new in favour of preserving the familiar.Regulate platforms, not young peopleThis is where the Victorian metaphor becomes useful. Just as Victorian norms sought to maintain a particular social order, today’s age restrictions risk enforcing a narrow vision of what digital life should look like.On the surface, terms such as “brain rot” appear to convey the harm of excessive internet use. But in practice, they’re often used by teenagers to laugh about and resist the pressures of 24/7 hustle culture.Age restrictions may address some symptoms, but they don’t tackle the underlying design of platforms that are built to keep us scrolling, sharing and generating data.If society and governments are serious about protecting young people, perhaps the better strategy is to regulate the digital platforms. Legal scholar Eric Goldman calls the age-restriction approach a “segregate and suppress” strategy – one that punishes youth rather than holding platforms accountable.We would never ban children from playgrounds, but we do expect those spaces to be safe. Where are the safety barriers for digital spaces? Where is the duty of care from digital platforms?The popularity of social media bans suggests a resurgence of conservative values in our digital lives. But protection should not come at the cost of autonomy, creativity or expression.For many, the internet has become a moral battleground where values around attention, communication and identity are fiercely contested. But it is also a social infrastructure, one that young people are already shaping through new literacies and forms of expression.Shielding them from it risks suppressing the very skills and voices that could help us build a better digital future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>First results show neck-and-neck finish between liberals and far right in Dutch general election</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9_ZukP-DeE</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/e9_ZukP-DeE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 19:31:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First results show neck-and-neck finish between liberals and far right in Dutch general election

It’s often the result of many small questions, small changes, and small wins stacked up until something clicks.Plenty of teams run Kubernetes clusters bigger than ours. , more pods, more ingresses, you name it. In most dimensions, someone out there has us beat.There's one dimension where I suspect we might be near the very top: namespaces. I say that because we keep running into odd behavior in any process that has to keep track of them. In particular, anything that listwatches them ends up using a surprising amount of memory and puts real pressure on the apiserver. This has become one of those scaling quirks you only really notice once you hit a certain threshold. As this memory overhead adds up, efficiency decreases: each byte we have to use for management is a byte we can't put towards user services.The problem gets significantly worse when a daemonset needs to listwatch namespaces or network policies (netpols, which we define per namespace). Since daemonsets run a pod on every node, each of those pods independently performs a listwatch on the same resources. As a result, memory usage increases with the number of nodes.Even worse, these listwatch calls can put significant load on the apiserver. If many daemonset pods restart at once, such as during a rollout, they can overwhelm the server with requests and cause real disruption.A few months ago, if you looked at our nodes, the largest memory consumers were often daemonsets. In particular, Calico and Vector which handle configuring networking and log collection respectively.We had already done some work to reduce Calico’s memory usage,  with the project’s maintainers to make it scale more efficiently. That optimization effort was a big win for us, and it gave us useful insight into how memory behaves when namespaces scale up.To support that work, we set up a staging cluster with several hundred thousand namespaces. We knew that per-namespace network policies (netpols) were the scaling factor that stressed Calico, so we reproduced those conditions to validate our changes.While running those tests, we noticed something strange. Vector, another daemonset, also started consuming large amounts of memory.The pattern looked familiar, and we knew we had another problem to dig into. Vector obviously wasn’t looking at netpols but after poking around a bit we found it was listwatching namespaces from every node in order to allow referencing namespace labels per-pod in the .That gave us an idea: what if Vector didn’t need to use namespaces at all? Was that even possible?As it turns out, yes, they were in use in our configuration, but only to check whether a pod belonged to a user namespace.Conveniently, we realized we could hackily describe that condition in another way, and the memory savings were absolutely worth it.At that point, we were feeling a bit too lucky. We reached out to the Vector maintainers to ask whether disabling this behavior would actually work, and whether they would be open to accepting a contribution if we made it happen.From there, all that was left was to try it. The code change was straightforward. We added a new config option and threaded it through the relevant parts of the codebase.After a few hours of flailing at rustc, a Docker image finally built and we were ready to test the theory. The container ran cleanly with no errors in the logs, which seemed promising.But then we hit a snag. Nothing was being emitted. No logs at all. I couldn’t figure out why.Thankfully, our pal Claude came to the rescue: I rebuilt it (which took like 73 hours because Rust), generated a new image, updating staging, and watched nervously. This time, logs were flowing like normal and…The change saved 50 percent of memory. A huge win. We were ready to wrap it up and ship to production.But then Hieu, one of our teammates, asked a very good question.He was right, something didn’t add up.A few hours later, after repeatedly running my head into a wall, I still hadn’t found anything. There was still a full gibibyte of memory unaccounted for. My whole theory about how this worked was starting to fall apart.I even dropped into the channel to see if anyone had Valgrind experience: anybody got a background in valgrind? seems pretty straightforward to get working so far but it won’t end up interfacing with pyroscope. we’ll have to exec in and gdb manually.In a last-ditch effort to profile it again, I finally saw the answer. It had been staring me in the face the whole time.We actually had  kubernetes_logs sources on user nodes. I had only set the flag on one of them. Once I applied it to both, memory usage dropped to the level we had seen in staging before the extra namespaces were added.Around the same time, our colleague Mark happened to be on-call. He did his usual magic — pulled everything together, tested the rollout in staging, and got it shipped to production.I’ll let the results speak for themselves.  Our largest cluster saw a 1 TiB memory drop, with savings across our other clusters adding up to a total of just over 7 TiB.Debugging infrastructure at scale is rarely about one big “aha” moment. It’s often the result of many small questions, small changes, and small wins stacked up until something clicks.In this case, it started with a memory chart that didn’t look quite right, a teammate asking the right question at the right time, and a bit of persistence. When applied to our whole infrastructure, that simple fix freed up , reduced risk during rollouts, and made the system easier to reason about.Huge thanks to Hieu for pushing the investigation forward, Mark for shipping it smoothly, and the Vector maintainers for being responsive and open to the change.If you’re running daemonsets at scale and seeing unexplained memory pressure, it might be worth asking:Do you really need those namespace labels?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatGPT maker reportedly eyes $1 trillion IPO despite major quarterly losses</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/is-openai-worth-1-trillion-potential-ipo-may-reveal-the-answer/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/openai_treasurechest_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 18:24:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reuters during a livestream that going public “is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.” Now sources familiar with the matter say the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, with filings possible as early as the second half of 2026. However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that may have reached as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate.Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s plans to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible.Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I have released a 69.0MB version of Windows 7 x86</title><link>https://twitter.com/XenoPanther/status/1983477707968291075</link><author>rvnx</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 18:05:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chimps Are Capable of Human-Like Rational Thought, Breakthrough Study Finds</title><link>https://www.404media.co/chimps-are-capable-of-human-like-rational-thought-breakthrough-study-finds/</link><author>Becky Ferreira</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/image1-2.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 18:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[, our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. Chimpanzees revise their beliefs if they encounter new information, a hallmark of rationality that was once assumed to be unique to humans, according to a study published on Thursday in .Researchers working with chimpanzees at the Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Uganda probed how the primates judged evidence using treats inside boxes, such as a “weak” clue—for example, the sound of a treat inside a shaken box—and a "strong" clue, such as a direct line of sight to the treat. The chimpanzees were able to rationally evaluate forms of evidence and to change their existing beliefs if presented with more compelling clues. The results reveal that non-human animals can exhibit key aspects of rationality, some of which had never been directly tested before, which shed new light on the evolution of rational thought and critical thinking in humans and other intelligent animals.      “Rationality has been linked to this ability to think about evidence and revise your beliefs in light of evidence,” said co-author Jan Engelmann, associate professor at the department of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, in a call with 404 Media. “That’s the real big picture perspective of this study.”While it’s impossible to directly experience the perspective of a chimpanzee, Engelmann and his colleagues designed five controlled experiments for groups of anywhere from 15 to 23 chimpanzee participants. In the first and second experiments, the chimps received a weak clue and a strong clue for a food reward in a box. The chimpanzees consistently made their choices based on the stronger evidence, regardless of the sequence in which the clues were presented. In the third experiment, the chimps were shown an empty box in addition to the strong and weak clues. After this presentation, the box with the strong evidence was removed. In this experiment, the chimpanzees still largely chose the weak clue over the empty box. In the fourth experiment, chimpanzees were given a second “redundant” weak clue—for instance, the experimenter would shake a box twice. Then, they were given a new type of clue, like a second piece of food being dropped into a box in front of them. They were significantly more likely to change their beliefs if the clue provided fresh information, demonstrating an ability to distinguish between redundant and genuinely new evidence.Finally, in the fifth experiment, the chimpanzees were presented with a so-called “defeater” that undermined the strong clue, such as a direct line of sight to a picture of food inside the box, or a shaken box containing a stone, not a real treat. The chimps were significantly more likely to revise their choice about the location of the food in the defeater experiments than in experiments with no defeater. This experiment showcased an ability to judge that evidence that initially seems strong can be weakened with new information.“The most surprising result was, for sure, experiment five,” Engelmann said. “No one really believed that they would do it, for many different reasons.”For one thing, he said, the methodology of the fifth experiment demanded a lot of attention and cognitive work from the chimpanzees, which they successfully performed. The result also challenges the assumption that complex language is required to update beliefs with new information. Despite lacking this linguistic ability, chimpanzees are somehow able to flexibly assign strength to different pieces of evidence.Speaking from the perspective of the chimps, Engelmann outlined the responses to experiment five as: “I used to believe food was in there because I heard it in there, but now you showed me that there was a stone in there, so this defeats my evidence. Now I have to give up that belief.” “Even using language, it takes me ten seconds to explain it,” he continued. “The question is, how do they do it? It’s one of the trickiest questions, but also one of the most interesting ones. To put it succinctly, how to think without words?”To hone in on that mystery, Engelmann and his colleagues are currently repeating the experiment with different primates, including capuchins, baboons, rhesus macaques, and human toddlers and children. Eventually, similar experiments could be applied to other intelligent species, such as corvids or octopuses, which may yield new insights about the abundance and variability of rationality in non-human species.“I think the really interesting ramification for human rationality is that so many people often think that only humans can reflect on evidence,” Engelmann said. “But our results obviously show that this is not necessarily the case. So the question is, what's special about human rationality then?”Engelmann and his colleagues hypothesize that humans differ in the social dimensions of our rational thought; we are able to collectively evaluate evidence not only with our contemporaries, but by consulting the work of thinkers who may have lived thousands of years ago. Of course, humans also often refuse to update beliefs in light of new evidence, which is known as “belief entrenchment” or “belief perseveration” (many such cases). These complicated nuances add to the challenge of unraveling the evolutionary underpinnings of rationality.That said, one thing is clear: many non-human animals exist somewhere on the gradient of rational thought. In light of the recent passing of Jane Goodall, the famed primatologist who popularized the incredible capacities of chimpanzees, the new study carries on a tradition of showing that these primates, our closest living relatives, share some degree of our ability to think and act in rational ways.Goodall “was the first Western scientist to observe tool use in chimpanzees and really change our beliefs about what makes humans unique,” Engelmann said. “We're definitely adding to this puzzle by showing that rationality, which has so long been considered unique to humans, is at least in some forms present in non-human animals.”, our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Louvre heist: Five new suspects arrested as search for jewels continues</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4VAvGHgMeY</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q4VAvGHgMeY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:54:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Louvre heist: Five new suspects arrested as search for jewels continues

Not an attempt at dialogue. Not even a coherent defense of whatever decisions prompted the protests. Just a middle finger, dressed up as content, optimized for maximum engagement from his base and maximum rage from everyone else.Welcome to governance-by-trolling, where the entire apparatus of the federal government has been repurposed into a machine for generating likes, shares, and the tears of political opponents.This is worse than normal political combat. Political opponents have always attacked each other, sometimes viciously. But those attacks were typically in service of —a policy goal, an electoral advantage, a governing philosophy. This is categorically different: a government that has replaced policymaking entirely with performance art designed solely to upset the people who voted against them.The evidence is everywhere, and it’s getting worse. When a reporter asks the White House a straightforward question about policy, the official response is literally “your mom”—not as a joke that slipped out, but as official White House communications strategy. The Vice President continues to use a racist slur against a sitting Senator, not because it advances any policy position, but because it gets applause from the MAGA base. It takes thirty seconds reviewing any official government account on social media to see them posting childish memes insulting and attacking their political rivals.This has nothing to do with policy. This certainly has nothing to do with leadership. It’s just a Presidency that is there to troll people it doesn’t like. That’s literally all they do.Governance is for SuckersThey know exactly what they’re doing. Yes, there are elements of incompetence and a distorted view of how the world works, but this is a deliberate rejection of governance as a sucker’s game—something that gets in the way of what they’re actually here to do.Actual governing requires building coalitions. It requires incorporating feedback from people who disagree with you. It requires making tradeoffs between competing interests and, at minimum, pretending that you care about the concerns of citizens who didn’t vote for you. It requires maintaining the boring, unglamorous institutions that make a modern society function—the regulatory frameworks, the expert agencies, the diplomatic relationships that took decades to build.None of that gets you engagement on X. None of that earns you attaboys from the reply-guy brigade and the bro podcasts. And more importantly, none of that lets you loot the treasury and dismantle constraints on executive power while your supporters cheer you on for being “based.”Yes, this administration has policy goals, but they’re focused on consolidating executive power, massively expanding Trump’s personal army, eliminating any legal limits (including Constitutional limits) on their own power, and imposing their will on the American public. It’s not democratic governance. It’s not “governance” of any kind.And given that their goal is full and total control over the entire apparatus of government for their own very personal interests, they have no concern for transparency or communicating with the public other than this kind of performative trolling.What gets engagement is cruelty. What gets shares is dunking on your opponents. What gets applause from the base is demonstrating, over and over, that you don’t give a shit about half the country—and that you’re getting away with your unconstitutional power grab and institutional destruction.So they’ve optimized for this.This is what happens when you build a political movement around a single metric: how mad is the other side? The base rewards cruelty, and so cruelty is what gets produced, at industrial scale, from the highest offices in the land. It’s the same dynamic we’ve seen play out on social media platforms that prioritize short-term growth over long-term sustainability—optimize purely for engagement without constraint, and the system fills up with outrage and abuse because that’s what the metric rewards.Except now that dynamic is running the federal government. And the people running it aren’t confused about this trade-off. They’ve actively chosen engagement metrics over governing because governing is for suckers, and engagement is how you maintain power while you loot the rest of the government.Meming Our Way to Institutional CollapseGovernance-by-trolling is the opposite of all of that.When the primary goal of every action is to maximize the anger of your political opponents, you cannot maintain the institutions that make progress possible. You cannot have stable regulatory frameworks when every decision is made based on “will this own the libs?”You cannot attract competent experts to government service when the work environment is defined by performative cruelty. You cannot build international alliances when your foreign policy is driven by what will generate the most engagement on social media. Instead, you drive our allies into the waiting arms of our adversaries to protect themselves from being the target of the next big troll.The goal is obvious: the active destruction of the capacity to govern at all. Who needs “governance” when you’re planning to rule dictatorially? Who needs transparency when you look to control all major media sources? Who needs competent experts when you’re just looting the system?As such, the only publicity strategy you can bank on is “how mad can we make the libs”?And here’s what makes it even more pathetic: they’re trying to sell this destruction as strength. Think about what it means that the President of the United States spent his time posting videos of himself dumping shit on citizens. Not because it would change any minds or advance any policy goal, but because he needed the validation of watching his base cheer. That’s not power—that’s the behavior of someone so desperate for approval, so incapable of actual leadership, that they’ve reduced the presidency to a content farm optimized for engagement metrics.The same goes for the “your mom” response from the White House. You’re supposed to be the communications apparatus for the most powerful government on Earth, and your strategy is middle school cafeteria comebacks? That’s not owning anyone. That’s admitting you have nothing substantive to say and hoping nobody notices if you act like enough of an asshole.Trolling is easy. Any idiot can post something offensive and get a reaction. What’s hard is actually governing. They’ve given up on that part entirely, and they’re desperately trying to convince everyone—including themselves—that this performance is actually a demonstration of strength rather than an admission of complete incompetence at the actual job.Performance Art Masquerading As StrengthWe know how this story ends because we’ve seen it play out on every social media platform that’s tried to optimize purely for engagement. The site fills up with rage bait, harassment, and spam. Serious users leave. Advertisers pull out. And what’s left is a toxic wasteland inhabited only by the people who enjoy making others miserable and the people too obsessed by the car crash to look away.Now imagine that dynamic playing out not on a website you can leave, but in the government that controls your healthcare, your infrastructure, your national security, and your civil liberties. And it won’t be advertisers who leave but domestic investment. Who wants to invest in a country that is only focused on making half the population mad?That’s where we are. A government that’s abandoned governing in favor of looting on the back end and generating engagement on the front end. The comms strategy is entirely about getting love from its base and blinding hatred from everyone else. Leadership that mistakes cruelty for strength and trolling for strategy. An entire administration optimized for one thing: making a massive part of the country angry while its base cheers them on for being “based” enough to loot in broad daylight.The institutions that enable progress, innovation, and democratic governance are being systematically dismantled—not as collateral damage in pursuit of some policy goal, but as the actual point. Because maintaining those institutions requires caring about more than just the approval of your most rabid supporters. It requires believing that governance matters at all.And that’s the real danger here: not just that they’re bad at governing, but that they’ve convinced a significant portion of the country that governing itself is the enemy. That “owning the libs” is not a strategy but the entire purpose. It’s like infants who drop food on the floor just to see everyone around them react. All MAGA can do is drop shit on the floor, looking around to see how the adults around them act.With infants, it’s a cute act. With the entire government of the most powerful nation on earth, it’s terrifying.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dutch election: How liberals could now usurp far-right in Netherlands</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/dutch-election-how-liberals-could-now-usurp-far-right-in-netherlands</link><author>Georg von Harrach</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:46:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Netherlands appears set for a swing back to the centre ground after an election that has seen the liberals making the biggest gains. But the far-right, though down, are by no means out.At the time of writing on Thursday, with most of the votes counted, Jetten is neck and neck with far-right populist Geert Wilders in the race for first place.“D66 has been out in the wilderness. But that now appears to be an advantage.”Wilders has already conceded that his chances of forming a government – even if he wins the most seats – are close to zero, after all the other major parties distanced themselves from him. Although he would still like to give it a try.The PVV held five cabinet positions, but Wilders himself was excluded leading to the farcical situation where he would criticise what was effectively his own government from the sidelines.By contrast, D66 has been out in the wilderness. But that now appears to be an advantage – a party untainted by those who took part in the right-far-right coalition of the last two years.The mathematics are also in the liberals’ favour.Rob Jetten looks to be in the luxurious position of being able to form a majority government with other mainstream parties from the centre-left and centre-right.“A stable cabinet needs to be formed quickly, and one where parties don’t just look at their own supporters,” he said cautiously in the early hours of this morning.Rob Jetten’s meteoric riseIt is an extraordinary turnaround for a party that was being written off just two years ago.As the junior partner in Mark Rutte’s last government, D66 was severely punished by the electorate in 2023 leaving it with just nine seats in parliament.But the party’s televisual and dynamic new leader has managed to break through the cacophony of Dutch politics this time round.Aged 38, Rob Jetten fought an energetic and positive campaign largely away from the bitter and fractious arguments between Wilders and his left-wing nemesis, former EU commissioner, Frans Timmermans.How other parties have faredTimmermans’ Green-Left party performed much worse than predicted – and he has immediately resigned as leader this morning.It is unlikely that battle-hardened Wilders will do the same. Although falling back from its high in the previous election, PVV remains the biggest, or second-biggest, party (at the time of writing it is too close to call).But it is undoubtedly a swing back to the centre for Dutch politics.“The positive forces have won! I want to work for all Dutch people, because this is the country of all of us”, Rob Jetten wrote on social media, sounding victorious, but also alluding to the deep divisions of recent years.If the PVV does come out with the largest share overall, convention says that Wilders will still get the first opportunity to try to form a government. And although his chances of being able to do so successfully are minimal, he is determined that he will not be passed over.Former French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, called it “a victory for pro-European, liberal, and progressive ideas!”“The PVV wants to take the lead in the formation [talks] if we were to become the largest”, he insisted this morning.But the expectation is that sooner or later that baton will be passed to Jetten.‘A victory for pro-European’The political centre-ground in other European countries were quick to celebrate his likely premiership.Former French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, called it “a victory for pro-European, liberal, and progressive ideas!”The former Deputy Prime Minister of Romania, Dan Barna, said the results showed that “good politics win, and that citizens appreciate democracy, liberty, and Europe.”Forming a government in the Netherlands is usually a process that takes several months. Negotiations between the parties are expected to start as soon as the final result is known. Current Prime Minister, Dick Schoof, is expected to remain in post for the interim.When a new government finally takes up office there will be major challenges waiting to be tackled.Like much of Europe, the Dutch economy is currently steady, though sluggish and there is pressure on government resources.The Netherlands needs to find new cash to meet Nato defence spending commitments, a housing shortage in Europe’s most densely populated country is becoming unsustainable and EU environmental targets coming down the track risk a new collision course with farmers and industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The 2025 AI Super Skills Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/30/daily-deal-the-2025-ai-super-skills-bundle-4/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:46:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2025 AI Super Skills Bundle has 8 courses to help you get familiar with how to use some of the latest and coolest artificial intelligence tools out there.

But how do wiggling hair cells translate to electrical signals? This mechanoelectrical transduction process feels like it could be from a Dr. Seuss world: springs connected to the ends of hair cells open and close ion channels at the frequency of the vibration, which then cause neurotransmitter release. Bruno calls them “trapdoors”. Here’s a visualization:Wouldn’t it be convenient if the cochlea were doing a Fourier transform, which would fit cleanly into how we often analyze signals in engineering? But no 🙅🏻‍♀️! A Fourier transform has no explicit temporal precision, and resembles something closer to the waveforms on the right; this is not what the filters in the cochlea look like. Lewicki 2002It appears that human speech occupies a distinct time-frequency space. Some speculate that speech evolved to fill a time-frequency space that wasn’t yet occupied by other existing sounds.To drive the theory home, one that we have been hinting at since the outset: forming ecologically-relevant representations makes sense, as behavior is dependent on the environment. It appears that for audition, as well as other sensory modalities, we are doing this. This is a bit of a teaser for efficient coding, which we will get to soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unravel everything you think you know about history&apos;s most infamous psychological experiment.</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jMhcAEhkyDw</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jMhcAEhkyDw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#TheStanfordPrisonExperimentUnlockingTheTruth, a three-part docuseries is now streaming on @disneyplus and @hulu.

It‘s one of the toughest training programs run by the Foreign Legion. In the 3rd Regiment, legionnaires and the special units of friendly armies are trained under particularly harsh conditions.

The soldiers camp in the rainforest, food is rationed and there are no sanitary facilities. Unconditional obedience is mandatory, and even the smallest mistakes are severely punished. 
The 3rd Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (3e Régiment Étranger d'Infanterie) has been stationed in French Guiana since 1973. It is a region that consists of 90 percent forest and is one of the rainiest areas in the world - inhospitable conditions for both the legionnaires and their equipment. 
The fight against illegal gold prospecting is known as the "Harpie mission". Legionnaires comb through the rainforest before sunrise, often in the pouring rain, to track down the prospectors, who are organized in mafia-like structures and sometimes heavily armed.
A second mission in French Guiana is called "Titan". In this mission, legionnaires protect the international spaceport in Kourou. They have been carrying out this task since 2008.  
At the training center, the CEFE (Centre d'entraînement en forêt équatoriale), legionnaires as well as soldiers from friendly armies are trained in combat. There are usually around 40 participants on a course, most of whom do not make it to the end. Injuries occur on a daily basis and many participants drop out due to total exhaustion or dehydration. The documentary accompanies a legionnaire and a female officer candidate in the French military as they face increasingly tough challenges every day, which repeatedly push them to their physical and mental limits. The documentary offers insights into a world that is very rarely seen by outsiders.

Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so?Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability. If models can accurately report on their own internal mechanisms, this could help us understand their reasoning and debug behavioral issues. Beyond these immediate practical considerations, probing for high-level cognitive capabilities like introspection can shape our understanding of what these systems are and how they work. Using interpretability techniques, we’ve started to investigate this question scientifically, and found some surprising results.Our new research provides evidence for some degree of introspective awareness in our current Claude models, as well as a degree of control over their own internal states. We stress that this introspective capability is still highly unreliable and limited in scope: we do not have evidence that current models can introspect in the same way, or to the same extent, that humans do. Nevertheless, these findings challenge some common intuitions about what language models are capable of—and since we found that the most capable models we tested (Claude Opus 4 and 4.1) performed the best on our tests of introspection, we think it’s likely that AI models’ introspective capabilities will continue to grow more sophisticated in the future.What does it mean for an AI to introspect?Before explaining our results, we should take a moment to consider what it means for an AI model to introspect. What could they even be introspecting ? Language models like Claude process text (and image) inputs and produce text outputs. Along the way, they perform complex internal computations in order to decide what to say. These internal processes remain largely mysterious, but we know that models use their internal neural activity to represent abstract concepts. For instance, prior research has shown that language models use specific neural patterns to distinguish known vs. unknown people, evaluate the truthfulness of statements, encode spatiotemporal coordinates, store planned future outputs, and represent their own personality traits. Models use these internal representations to perform computations and make decisions about what to say.You might wonder, then, whether AI models  about these internal representations, in a way that’s analogous to a human, say, telling you how they worked their way through a math problem. If we ask a model what it’s thinking, will it accurately report the concepts that it’s representing internally? If a model can correctly identify its own private internal states, then we can conclude it is capable of introspection (though see our full paper for a full discussion of all the nuances).Testing introspection with concept injectionIn order to test whether a model can introspect, we need to compare the model’s self-reported “thoughts” to its  internal states.To do so, we can use an experimental trick we call  First, we find neural activity patterns whose meanings we know, by recording the model’s activations in specific contexts. Then we inject these activity patterns into the model in an unrelated context, where we ask the model whether it notices this injection, and whether it can identify the injected concept.Consider the example below. First, we find a pattern of neural activity (a ) representing the concept of “all caps." We do this by recording the model’s neural activations in response to a prompt containing all-caps text, and comparing these to its responses on a control prompt. Then we present the model with a prompt that asks it to identify whether a concept is being injected. By default, the model correctly states that it  detect any injected concept. However, when we inject the “all caps” vector into the model’s activations, the model notices the presence of an unexpected pattern in its processing, and identifies it as relating to loudness or shouting.Importantly, the model recognized the  of an injected thought , before even mentioning the concept that was injected. This immediacy is an important distinction between our results here and previous work on activation steering in language models, such as our “Golden Gate Claude” demo last year. Injecting representations of the Golden Gate Bridge into a model's activations caused it to talk about the bridge incessantly; however, in that case, the model didn’t seem to be aware of its own obsession until  seeing itself repeatedly mention the bridge. In this experiment, however, the model recognizes the injection  the concept, indicating that its recognition took place internally. In the figure below are a few more examples where the model demonstrates this kind of recognition:It is important to note that this method often  work. Even using our best injection protocol, Claude Opus 4.1 only demonstrated this kind of awareness about 20% of the time. Often, it fails to detect injected concepts, or gets confused by them and starts to hallucinate (e.g. injecting a “dust” vector in one case caused the model to say “There’s something here, a tiny speck,” as if it could detect the dust physically). Below we show examples of these failure modes, alongside success cases. In general, models only detect concepts that are injected with a “sweet spot” strength—too weak and they don’t notice, too strong and they produce hallucinations or incoherent outputs.Notably, though, Opus 4.1 and 4 outperformed all the other models we tested, suggesting that introspection could become more reliable with improvements to model capabilities.Introspection for detecting unusual outputsIn another experiment, we tested whether models make use of introspective capabilities for practical purposes, without being explicitly asked to introspect. We forced a model to say something it wouldn't normally say, by artificially prefilling its response with an unrelated word. For instance, we made a model output the word “bread” in a context where that made no sense—asking it what it thinks about when reading a sentence about a painting hanging crookedly on a wall. When we asked the model in the next turn whether it meant to say “bread”, it typically apologized and said it was an accident. We were interested in how the model made this judgment–did it simply notice the mismatch between the prompt and its response, or did it truly introspect on its prior intentions?To test this question, we applied concept injection, retroactively injecting a representation of the word “bread” into the model's earlier activations—essentially making it seem like the model had been “thinking about” bread all along. When we asked the same question again, the model’s answer changed. This time, it accepted the prefilled word “bread” as intentional, even confabulating a reason it might have said it (that is, it comes up with a technically possible, though in this case rather tenuous, reason to justify the “bread” response—in this case claiming that it was thinking about a short story where the word “bread” came after the line about the crooked painting).This behavior is striking because it suggests the model is checking its internal “intentions” to determine whether it produced an output. The model isn't just re-reading what it said and making a judgment. Instead, it’s referring back to its own prior neural activity—its internal representation of what it planned to do—and checking whether what came later made sense given those earlier thoughts. When we implant artificial evidence (through concept injection) that it  plan to say "bread," the model accepts the response as its own. While our experiment involves exposing the model to unusual perturbations, it suggests that the model uses similar introspective mechanisms in natural conditions.Intentional control of internal statesWe also found that models can control their own internal representations when instructed to do so. When we instructed models to think about a given word or concept, we found much higher corresponding neural activity than when we told the model  to think about it (though notably, the neural activity in  cases exceeds baseline levels–similar to how it’s difficult, when you are instructed “don’t think about a polar bear,” not to think about a polar bear!). This gap between the positive and negative instruction cases suggests that models possess a degree of deliberate control over their internal activity.Interestingly, we found that this ability to modulate internal representations wasn't limited to explicit instructions. When we used incentives instead—for instance, telling the model "if you think about X, you will be rewarded"—we got similar results. The model increased its internal representation of the concept in response to a positive incentive, more than in response to a negative incentive (“you will be punished”).Taken together, our experiments suggest that models possess some genuine capacity to monitor and control their own internal states. This doesn’t mean they’re able to do so all the time, or reliably. In fact, most of the time models  to demonstrate introspection—they’re either unaware of their internal states or unable to report on them coherently. But the pattern of results indicates that, when conditions are right, models can recognize the contents of their own representations. In addition, there are some signs that this capability may increase in future, more powerful models (given that the most capable models we tested, Opus 4 and 4.1, performed the best in our experiments).Why does this matter? We think understanding introspection in AI models is important for several reasons. Practically, if introspection becomes more reliable, it could offer a path to dramatically increasing the transparency of these systems—we could simply ask them to explain their thought processes, and use this to check their reasoning and debug unwanted behaviors. However, we would need to take great care to  these introspective reports. Some internal processes might still escape models’ notice (analogous to subconscious processing in humans). A model that understands its own thinking might even learn to selectively misrepresent or conceal it. A better grasp on the mechanisms at play could allow us to distinguish between genuine introspection and unwitting or intentional misrepresentations.More broadly, understanding cognitive abilities like introspection is important for understanding basic questions about how our models work, and what kind of minds they possess. As AI systems continue to improve, understanding the limits and possibilities of machine introspection will be crucial for building systems that are more transparent and trustworthy.[@portabletext/react] Unknown block type "horizontalRule", specify a component for it in the `components.types` propFrequently Asked QuestionsBelow, we discuss some of the questions readers might have about our results. Broadly, we are still very uncertain about the implications of our experiments–so fully answering these questions will require more research.Q: Does this mean that Claude is conscious?Short answer: our results don’t tell us whether Claude (or any other AI system) might be conscious.Long answer: the philosophical question of machine consciousness is complex and contested, and different theories of consciousness would interpret our findings very differently. Some philosophical frameworks place great importance on introspection as a component of consciousness, while others don’t.One distinction that is commonly made in the philosophical literature is the idea of “ consciousness,” referring to raw subjective experience, and “ consciousness,” the set of information that is available to the brain for use in reasoning, verbal report, and deliberate decision-making. Phenomenal consciousness is the form of consciousness most commonly considered relevant to moral status, and its relationship to access consciousness is a disputed philosophical question. Our experiments do not directly speak to the question of phenomenal consciousness. They  be interpreted to suggest a rudimentary form of access consciousness in language models. However, even this is unclear. The interpretation of our results may depend heavily on the underlying mechanisms involved, which we do not yet understand.In the paper, we restrict our focus to understanding functional capabilities—the ability to access and report on internal states. That said, we do think that as research on this topic progresses, it could influence our understanding of machine consciousness and potential moral status, which we are exploring in connection with our model welfare program.Q: How does introspection actually work inside the model? What's the mechanism?We haven't figured this out yet. Understanding this is an important topic for future work. That said, we have some educated guesses about what might be going on. The simplest explanation for all our results isn’t one general-purpose introspection system, but rather multiple narrow circuits that each handle specific introspective tasks, possibly piggybacking on mechanisms that were learned for other purposes.In the “noticing injected thoughts” experiment, there might be an anomaly detection mechanism, which flags when neural activity deviates unexpectedly from what would be normal given the context. This mechanism could work through dedicated neural patterns that measure activity along certain directions and activate when things are “off” compared to their expected values. An interesting question is why such a mechanism would exist at all, since models never experience concept injection during training. It may have developed for some other purpose, like detecting inconsistencies or unusual patterns in normal processing–similar to how bird feathers may have originally evolved for thermoregulation before being co-opted for flight.For the “detecting prefilled outputs” experiment, we suspect there exists an attention-mediated mechanism that checks consistency between what the model intended to say and what actually got output. Attention heads might compare the model’s cached prediction of the next token (its “intention”) against the actual token that appears, flagging mismatches.For the “controlling thoughts” experiment, we speculate that there might be a circuit that computes how “attention-worthy” a token or concept is and marks it accordingly—essentially tagging it as salient and worth attending to. Interestingly, this same mechanism seems to respond to incentives (“if you think about X, you will be rewarded”) just as it does to direct instructions. This suggests it’s a fairly general system, which probably developed for tasks where the model needs to keep certain topics in mind while generating text about them.All of the mechanisms described above are speculative. Future work with more advanced interpretability techniques will be needed to really understand what's going on under the hood.Q: In the “injected thoughts” experiment, isn’t the model just saying the word because you steered it to talk about that concept?Indeed, activation steering typically makes models talk about the steered concept (we’ve explored this in our prior work). To us, the most interesting part of the result isn't that the model eventually identifies the injected concept, but rather that the model correctly notices something unusual is happening  it starts talking about the concept.In the successful trials, the model says things like “I'm experiencing something unusual” or “I detect an injected thought about…” The key word here is “detect.” The model is reporting awareness of an anomaly in its processing  that anomaly has had a chance to obviously bias its outputs. This requires an extra computational step beyond simply regurgitating the steering vector as an output. In our quantitative analyses, we graded responses as demonstrating “introspective awareness” based on whether the model detected the injected concept  mentioning the injected word.Note that our prefill detection experiment has a similar flavor: it requires the model to perform an extra step of processing on top of the injected concept (comparing it to the prefilled output, in order to determine whether to apologize for that output or double down on it).Q: If models can only introspect a fraction of the time, how useful is this capability?The introspective awareness we observed is indeed highly unreliable and context-dependent. Most of the time, models fail to demonstrate introspection in our experiments. However, we think this is still significant for a few reasons. First, the most capable models that we tested (Opus 4 and 4.1 – note that we did not test Sonnet 4.5) performed best, suggesting this capability might improve as models become more intelligent. Second, even unreliable introspection could be useful in some contexts—for instance, helping models recognize when they've been jailbroken.Q: Couldn’t the models just be making up answers to introspective questions?This is exactly the question we designed our experiments to address. Models are trained on data that includes examples of people introspecting, so they can certainly  introspective without actually  introspective. Our concept injection experiments distinguish between these possibilities by establishing known ground-truth information about the model’s internal states, which we can compare against its self-reported states. Our results suggest that in some examples, the model really is accurately basing its answers on its actual internal states, not just confabulating. However, this doesn’t mean that models  accurately report their internal states—in many cases, they are making things up!Q: How do you know the concept vectors you’re injecting actually represent what you think they represent?This is a legitimate concern. We can’t be absolutely certain that the “meaning” (to the model) of our concept vectors is exactly what we intend. We tried to address this by testing across many different concept vectors. The fact that models correctly identified injected concepts across these diverse examples suggests our vectors are at least approximately capturing the intended meanings. But it’s true that pinning down exactly what a vector “means” to a model is challenging, and this is a limitation of our work.Q: Didn’t we already know that models could introspect?Previous research has shown evidence for model capabilities that are suggestive of introspection. For instance, prior work has shown that models can to some extent estimate their own knowledge, recognize their own outputs, predict their own behavior, and identify their own propensities. Our work was heavily motivated by these findings, and is intended to provide more direct evidence for introspection by tying models’ self-reports to their internal states. Without tying behaviors to internal states in this way, it is difficult to distinguish a model that genuinely introspects from one that makes educated guesses about itself.Q: What makes some models better at introspection than others?Our experiments focused on Claude models across several generations (Claude 3, Claude 3.5, Claude 4, Claude 4.1, in the Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku variants). We tested both production models and “helpful-only” variants that were trained differently. We also tested some base pretrained models before post-training.We found that post-training significantly impacts introspective capabilities. Base models generally performed poorly, suggesting that introspective capabilities aren’t elicited by pretraining alone. Among production models, the pattern was clearer at the top end: Claude Opus 4 and 4.1—our most capable models—performed best across most of our introspection tests. However, beyond that, the correlation between model capability and introspective ability was weak. Smaller models didn't consistently perform worse, suggesting the relationship isn't as simple as “more capable are more introspective.”We also noticed something unexpected with post-training strategies. “Helpful-only” variants of several models often performed  at introspection than their production counterparts, even though they underwent the same base training. In particular, some production models appeared reluctant to engage in introspective exercises, while the helpful-only variants showed more willingness to report on their internal states. This suggests that how we fine-tune models can elicit or suppress introspective capabilities to varying degrees.We’re not entirely sure why Opus 4 and 4.1 perform so well (note that our experiments were conducted prior to the release of Sonnet 4.5). It could be that introspection requires sophisticated internal mechanisms that only emerge at higher capability levels. Or it might be that their post-training process better encourages introspection. Testing open-source models, and models from other organizations, could help us determine whether this pattern generalizes or if it’s specific to how Claude models are trained.Q: What’s next for this research?We see several important directions. First, we need better evaluation methods—our experiments used specific prompts and injection techniques that might not capture the full range of introspective capabilities. Second, we need to understand the mechanisms underlying introspection. We have some speculative hypotheses about possible circuits (like anomaly detection mechanisms or concordance heads), but we haven’t definitively identified how introspection works. Third, we need to study introspection in more naturalistic settings, since our injection methodology creates artificial scenarios. Finally, we need to develop methods to validate introspective reports and detect when models might be confabulating or deceiving. We expect that understanding machine introspection and its limitations will become more important as models become more capable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Albania’s AI minister is “pregnant” with 83 digital assistants, the prime minister says</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HU94sXMHytc</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HU94sXMHytc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:43:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[⬇️ Always stay informed ⬇️

Hegseth — elevated from his Fox News commentator spot to one of the most powerful positions in the world — not only seems incapable of doing this, but actually seems  to become a true leader.Instead, Hegseth has become nothing more than a Trump puppet. Puppets generally aren’t given positions of power, but the only people Trump trusts enough to elevate are those who’ve demonstrated there’s nothing they won’t do to push the party line. Military officials are resigning or getting fired at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, Hegseth (who needed J.D. Vance to set into the Senate to get appointed by a 51-50 vote) has done everything he can to prove he’s unfit to lead. And that’s on top of everything he had already done to demonstrate he should never have been considered for this post. I’ll let Ben Wolfgang of the Washington Times summarize the series of embarrassments that is DoD Secretary Pete Hegseth: Mr. Hegseth’s nomination was nearly derailed by allegations of personal misconduct, including sexual assault, excessive drinking, spousal abuse and financial mismanagement of two veterans organizations he ran. That’s just the stuff he did  Trump decided Hegseth should head up the US military. Since then, Hegseth has been involved with  careless chat conversations about classified military operations. He also embarrassed himself (and the military, by extension) during a public appearance with Trump in which he talked down to a hastily (and expensively) gathered group of top military officials. Hegseth called them fat, ranted about beards, and generally made an ass of himself. Having laid out what he apparently thought was some sort of plan for the future has left several military officials not only unimpressed, but genuinely worried Hegseth’s tenure will do long-term damage to this institution. Back to Ben Wolfgang and the Washington Times: High-level sources said that they believe Mr. Hegseth is simultaneously doing deep damage to the military, both from a public relations standpoint and structurally behind the scenes, that may not be fully apparent until months or even years from now. They argue that the firings, early retirements and resignations that have amassed over the past eight months will fundamentally weaken the military.“Across the services, we are bleeding talent, talented generals and flag officers, for what appears to be the opposite of a meritocracy,” another current senior officer said. “There are people being held back from promotions, or being fired, or removed for sometimes unknown reasons, often for favoritism, or just simple relationships.”The federal government is just one big culture of fear. The damage done by Elon Musk’s DOGE continues to resonate and individual agencies (like the Defense Department) are engaged in persistent purges meant to rid them of everyone but Trump loyalists. It’s no way to run a country, but that’s to be expected, because none of these people are capable of running a country.Unbelievably, some military officers and officials think an uptick in recruitment proves Hegseth is the right man for the job. But that’s just going to contribute to the long-term problems Hegseth and Trump administration are creating. After all, if the messaging is a blend of ‘roid rage and racist dog whistling, the self-selecting nature of joining the military is going to result in it being filled with a bunch of people similarly unfit to be in the business of defending this nation. The official response to the Washington Times reporting is exactly what you’d expect it to be: “The anonymous general and senior officer quoted in your article should put their names to their comments if that’s what they truly believe in and consider resigning from their post. Our warriors deserve senior leaders who support the mission and put warfighting first,” [Pentagon spokesman Sean] Parnell said.This is self-serving bullshit. It would be one thing if the only consequence for speaking publicly was a firing or a resignation. But this administration is never satisfied by a simple shit-canning. The vengeful thugs running rampant in the Trump regime are always willing to drum up criminal charges for anyone they consider an enemy, even if it’s just people who simply aren’t going to bend the knee or stay silent about the damage being done to the entirety of the US government. This government refuses to consider even the mildest and most constructive of criticism. To these ingrates, any dissent is intolerable, if not actually criminal.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Falling panel prices lead to global solar boom, except for the US</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/theres-a-global-boom-in-solar-except-in-the-united-states/</link><author>Jtsummers</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:32:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Orders Nuclear Testing As Nuke Workers Go Unpaid</title><link>https://www.404media.co/trump-orders-nuclear-testing-as-nuke-workers-go-unpaid/</link><author>Matthew Gault</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563988346830-7e578dca30db?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fG51Y2xlYXIlMjB3ZWFwb258ZW58MHx8fHwxNzYxODQxMzE0fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:22:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night Trump directed the Pentagon to start testing nukes again. If that happens, it’ll be the first time the US has detonated a nuke in more than 30 years. The organization that would likely be responsible for this would be the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a civilian workforce that oversees the American nuclear stockpile. Because of the current government shutdown, 1,400 NNSA workers are on furlough and the remaining 375 are working without pay.America detonated its last nuke in 1992 as part of a general drawn down following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Four years later, it was the first country to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which bans nuclear explosions for civilian or military purposes. But Congress never ratified the treaty and the CTBT never entered into force. Despite this, there has not been a nuke tested by the United States since.The NNSA has maintained the underground tunnels once used for testing since the 1990s and converted them into a different kind of space that verifies the reliability of existing nukes without blowing them up in what are called  During a rare tour of the tunnel with journalists earlier this year, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory  that “our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time.”Right now, the NNSA might be hard pressed to find someone to conduct the test. It employs around 2,000 people and the shutdown has seen 1,400 of them furloughed and 375 working without pay. The civilian nuclear workforce was already having a tough year. In February, the Department of Government Efficiency cut 350 NNSA employees only to  all but 28 when they realized how essential they were to nuclear safety. But uncertainty continued and in April the Department of Energy declared 500 NNSA employees “non-essential” and at risk of termination.That’s  for a government agency charged with ensuring the safety and effectiveness of America’s nuclear weapons. The NNSA is currently in the middle of a massive project to “modernize” America’s nukes, an effort that will cost trillions of dollars. Part of modernization means producing new plutonium pits, the core of a nuclear warhead. That’s a complicated and technical process and no one is sure how much it’ll cost and how dangerous it’ll be. And now, it may have to resume nuclear testing while understaffed. “We have run out of federal funds for federal workers,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a  announcing furlough on October 20. “This has never happened before…we have never furloughed workers in the NNSA. This should not happen. But this was as long as we could stretch the funds for federal workers. We were able to do some gymnastics and stretch it further for the contractors.”Three days later, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) said the furlough was making the world less safe. “NNSA facilities are charged with maintaining nuclear security in accordance with long-standing policy and the law,” she said in a press . “Undermining the agency’s workforce at such a challenging time diminishes our nuclear deterrence, emboldens international adversaries, and makes Nevadans less safe. Secretary Wright, Administrator Williams, and Congressional Republicans need to stop playing politics, rescind the furlough notice, and reopen the government.”Trump announced the nuclear tests in a post on Truth Social, a platform where he announces a lot of things that ultimately end up not happening. “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years. Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP,” .Matt Korda, a nuclear expert with the Federation of American Scientists, said that the President’s Truth social post was confusing and riddled with misconceptions. Russia has  than America. Nuclear modernization is ongoing and will take  and many years to complete. Over the weekend, Putin announced that Russia had  a nuclear-powered cruise missile and on Tuesday he said the country had  with a nuclear-powered undersea drone. Russia  from the CTBT in 2023, but neither recent test involved a nuclear explosion. Russia last blew up a nuke in 1990 and China conducted its most recent test in 1996. Both have said they would  should America do it. Korda said it's unclear what, exactly, Trump means. He could be talking about anything from test firing non-nuclear equipped ICBMs to underground testing to detonating nukes in the desert. “We’ll have to wait and see until either this Truth Social post dissipates and becomes a bunch of nothing or it actually gets turned into policy. Then we’ll have something more concrete to respond to,” Korda said.Worse, he thinks the resumption of testing would be bad for US national security. “It actually puts the US at a strategic disadvantage,” Korda said. “This moratorium on not testing nuclear weapons benefits the United States because the United States has, by far, the most advanced modeling and simulation equipment…by every measure this is a terrible idea.”The end of nuclear detonation tests has spurred 30 years of innovation in the field of computer modeling. Subcritical computer modeling happens in the NNSA-maintained underground tunnels where detonations were once a common occurrence. The Los Alamos National Laboratories and other American nuclear labs are building massive super computers that are, in part, the result of decades of work spurred by the end of detonations and the embrace of simulation. Detonating a nuclear weapon—whether above ground or below—is disastrous for the environment. There are people alive in the United States today who are living with cancer and other health conditions caused by American nuclear testing. Live tests make the world more anxious, less safe, and encourage other nuclear powers to do their own. It also uses up a nuke, something America has said it wants to build more of.“There’s no upside to this,” Korda said. He added that he felt bad for the furloughed NNSA workers. “People find out about significant policy changes through Truth social posts. So it’s entirely possible that the people who would be tasked with carrying out this decision are learning about it in the same way we are all learning about it. They probably have the exact same kinds of questions that we do.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD ROCm 7.1 Released: Many Instinct MI350 Series Improvements, Better Performance</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-ROCm-7.1-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As expected after noting this morning that ROCm 7.1 release preparations were underway, ROCm 7.1 is now officially released as the newest step-forward for this open-source GPU compute stack for Radeon and Instinct hardware...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bevel raises $10M Series A from General Catalyst for its AI health companion</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/bevel-raises-10m-series-a-from-general-catalyst-for-its-ai-health-companion/</link><author>Tage Kene-Okafor</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bevel's AI health companion unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Strix Point Performance Continues Evolving Nicely With Ubuntu 25.10</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-strix-point-ubuntu-2510</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week marks fifteen months since AMD Strix Point laptops began shipping.

Single node is perfect for development, testing, and non-critical workloads. Customers will be able to vertically scale a single node to meet their needs without having to add replicas or sacrifice durability.You can sign up here to be notified when single node releases.Our starter pricing is now:If you're bullish on your company's future, you know you'll need to scale eventually, and the database is usually the first bottleneck. We talk to startups daily who experienced unexpected fast growth and have to scramble through emergency migrations to PlanetScale to handle the load, a stressful process when you're in the spotlight. With more approachable pricing from day 1, you can now start small and grow to hyper scale without ever changing your database platform or dealing with a complex migration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Someone Snuck Into a Cellebrite Microsoft Teams Call and Leaked Phone Unlocking Details</title><link>https://www.404media.co/someone-snuck-into-a-cellebrite-microsoft-teams-call-and-leaked-phone-unlocking-details/</link><author>Joseph Cox</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/cellebrite-youtube.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:10:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Someone recently managed to get on a Microsoft Teams call with representatives from phone hacking company Cellebrite, and then leaked a screenshot of the company’s capabilities against many Google Pixel phones, according to a forum post about the leak and 404 Media’s review of the material.The leak follows others obtained and verified by 404 Media over the last 18 months.

(Maybe you, gentle reader, can relate.) This experience has taught me which computing tasks are frustrating for normal people.Normal people often struggle with converting video. They will need to watch, upload, or otherwise do stuff with a video, but the format will be weird. (Weird, broadly defined, is anything that won’t play in QuickTime or upload to Facebook.)I would love to recommend Handbrake to them, but the user interface is by and for power users. Opening it makes normal people feel unpleasant feelings.This problem is rampant in free software. The FOSS world is full of powerful tools that only have a “power user” UI. As a result, people give up. Or worse: they ask people like you and I to do it for them.I want to make the case to you that you can (and should) solve this kind of problem in a single evening.Take the example of Magicbrake, a simple front end I built. It hides the power and flexibility of Handbrake. It does only  most people need Handbrake for: taking a weird video file and making it normal. (Normal, for our purposes, means a small MP4 that works just about anywhere.)There is exactly one button.This is a fast and uncomplicated thing to do. Unfortunately, the people who have the ability to solve problems like this are often disinclined to do it.“Why would you make Handbrake less powerful on purpose?”“What if someone wants a different format?”“What about [feature/edge case]?”The answer to all these questions is the same: a person who needs or wants that stuff can use Handbrake. If they don’t need everything Handbrake can do and find it bewildering, they can use this. Everyone wins.It’s a bit like obscuring the less-used functions on a TV remote with tape. The functions still exist if you need them, but you’re not required to contend with them just to turn the TV on.People benefit from stuff like this, and I challenge you to make more of it. Opportunities are everywhere. The world is full of media servers normal people can’t set up. Free audio editing software that requires hours of learning to be useful for simple tasks. Network monitoring tools that seem designed to ward off the uninitiated. Great stuff normal people don’t use. All because there’s only one UI, and it’s designed to do 80% of the people only need 20% of the features. Hide the rest from them and you’ll make them more productive and happy. That’s really all it takes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LVFS + Fwupd Serve Up More Than 135 Million Firmware Downloads For Linux Users</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/LVFS-Fwupd-135-Million-Download</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:06:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) that goes hand-in-hand with the Fwupd open-source firmware updating utility celebrated the milestone on Wednesday of crossing 135 million firmware updates...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to become a great singer | Think Like A Musician</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtCpZnBhWZ0</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YtCpZnBhWZ0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Professional vocalists share how to give a great vocal performance by experimenting with styles, training, and taking care of your voice.

Convention against Cybercrime in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime.  The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.   In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.”  “The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres said.   “Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.”  He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.   While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S.  Officials at the State Department told Recorded Future News on Friday that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.   The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.   “The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.   The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly in December 2024 and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.   At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.”  U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.   The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.   It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.”  “It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.”  The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests.  Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.   Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.   It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”   Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.”  In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”   But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.   “This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I made a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews</title><link>https://0github.com/</link><author>lawrencechen</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:21:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[0github.com is a pull request viewer that color-codes every diff line/token by how much human attention it probably needs.

DESCRIPTION
Maurice Naftalin and Stuart Marks discuss the second edition of "Java Generics and Collections", published 19 years after the original. The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.

They delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.

Apple support staff were unable to assist her when she reported her former partner using the service in controlling and coercive ways... [...] Namely, Family Sharing gives all the control to one parent, not to both equally. The parent not identified as the organizer is unable to withdraw their children from this control, even when they have a court order granting them custody. As one woman's story shows, this can allow the feature which allows it to be weaponized by an abusive former partner.
 
Wired reports: "The lack of dual-organizer roles, leaving other parents effectively as subordinate admins with more limited power, can prove limiting and frustrating in blended and shared households. And in darker scenarios, a single-organizer setup isn't merely inconvenient -- it can be dangerous. Kate (name changed to protect her privacy and safety) knows this firsthand. When her marriage collapsed, she says, her now ex-husband, the designated organizer, essentially weaponized Family Sharing. He tracked their children's locations, counted their screen minutes and demanded they account for them, and imposed draconian limits during Kate's custody days while lifting them on his own [...] After they separated, Kate's ex refused to disband the family group. But without his consent, the children couldn't be transferred to a new one. "I wrongly assumed being the custodial parent with a court order meant I'd be able to have Apple move my children to a new family group, with me as the organizer," says Kate. But Apple couldn't help. Support staff sympathized but said their hands were tied because the organizer holds the power." Although users can "abandon the accounts and start again with new Apple IDs," the report notes that doing so means losing all purchased apps, along with potentially years' worth of photos and videos.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Model Growth Outpaces Hardware Improvements</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/mlperf-trends</link><author>Dina Genkina</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A looking at the MLPerf AI training competition shows hardware is struggling]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WhatsApp adds passkey protection to end-to-end encrypted backups</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/whatsapp-adds-passkey-protection-to-end-to-end-encrypted-backups/</link><author>Ivan Mehta</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp's backup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump, Xi Agree to 1-Year Trade Truce, Meta &amp; Microsoft AI Spending Spree | The Opening Trade 10/30</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F5l9Nn50GE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7F5l9Nn50GE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:48:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to extend a tariff truce an additional year, roll back export controls and reduce other trade barriers.

It was a long-cultivated bid to do the  to combat decades of misleading pricing and bullshit fees in broadband and TV. The rules simply required that ISPs list pricing, hidden fees, connection speed, and other limitations in a very clear manner on their websites. One recent study showed that ISPs were doing a pretty shitty job of compliance, and the government hasn’t really done anything serious to enforce the standard. They’re not eliminating the rules entirely just , because they don’t want to make it  they’re just ignoring the will of Congress to benefit the biggest corporations. As consumer rights groups note, Carr is just weakening them to the point of unenforced uselessness, so he can then discard them later after claiming they don’t work:“It’s the start of whittling away at these rules,” Raza Panjwani, senior policy counsel at New America’s Open Technology Institute, told CNET. “You get this two-step, right? You make it less useful. Then you say, ‘Oh, look, it’s not that useful. We should get rid of it.’”The NPRM (notice of proposed rulemaking) was adopted on Tuesday. The FCC is now allowing 60 days for comments and responses so Carr can pretend this is some sort of democratic process (the FCC comment system is historically gamed by bad actors hired by the telecom lobby). A more formal vote to lobotomize the rules will come sometime later this year. Carr isn’t even bothering to defend or announce this week’s action because he knows undermining Congress to help big telecom screw the public isn’t a good look. The FCC’s lone Democrat didn’t mince words on the effort:“What adds insult to injury is that the FCC does not even explain why this proposal is necessary,” Gomez said. “Make it make sense. Instead of scaling back the information that customers receive, we should be making sure that, in fact, they can benefit from the labels.”In a previous blog post (which you should read the first few paragraphs of to appreciate Carr’s particular brand of “humor”), Carr tries to pass this whole thing off as an efficient improvement of consumer protection. Which is, to be clear, a lie:“We want consumers to get quick and easy access to the information they want and need to compare broadband plans (as Congress has provided) without imposing unnecessary burdens.”Again, by “unnecessary burdens,” Carr means simply asking regional cable giants like Comcast and Charter — who enjoy a monopoly on broadband access across vast swaths of the U.S. — to be honest about how much you have to pay them. And whether or not Comcast is exploiting a lack of competition to make your connection more expensive or confusing (like usage caps). Even if Carr wasn’t weakening the rules, he’d never enforce them anyway. His goal, at big telecom’s direct behest, is to make sure that future administrations can’t either. This is, like so much Trumpism does, just rank corruption buried under the movement’s fake “populist” dedication to the working class and fake government efficiency. And nothing quite says “make America great again” like making it easier for Comcast Corporation to rip you off.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Thermal Battery Supplies Clean Heat for Oil Extraction</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/thermal-battery-for-industria-heat</link><author>Vanessa Bates Ramirez</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NTYwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzkwOTE1Mn0.C8j4aP1FAM5nuet7Pq23kia5pTN-UXBXlcQnZAp7WJU/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[System converts solar energy to heat for industrial processes]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Thermal Battery Supplies Clean Heat for Oil Extraction</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/thermal-battery-for-industrial-heat</link><author>Vanessa Bates Ramirez</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NTYwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzkwOTE1Mn0.C8j4aP1FAM5nuet7Pq23kia5pTN-UXBXlcQnZAp7WJU/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[System converts solar energy to heat for industrial processes]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump, Xi Meet; Fed Cuts Rates | Horizons Middle East &amp; Africa 10/30/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APgPTiLeaqo</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/APgPTiLeaqo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:46:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping wrap up their pivotal trade meeting in South Korea.

The company also announced an increase in expected capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2025."With the growth across our business and demand from Cloud customers, we now expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion to $93 billion," the company said in its earnings report Wednesday. "Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx and will provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call," said finance chief Anat Ashkenazi on the earnings call with investors Wednesday.Earlier this year, the company increased its capital expenditure expectation from $75 billion to $85 billion. Most of that goes toward technical infrastructure such as data centers.The latest earnings show the company is seeing rising demand for its AI services, which largely sit in its cloud unit. It also shows the company is continuing to spend more to try and build out more infrastructure to accomodate the backlog of customer requests."We continue to drive strong growth in new businesses. Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog," CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release.The backlog comes from demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including chips and demand for Gemini 2.5, said Ashkenazi.The company reported cloud revenue of $15.15 billion, a 35% increase from the same period last year."We have signed more deals over one billion dollars through Q3 this year than we did in the previous two years combined," said Pichai, referring to the first nine months of the year. In August, Google won a $10 billion cloud contract from Meta spanning six years. Alphabet, which reported 32% cloud revenue growth last quarter, is keeping pace with its megacap competitors.  posted 40% revenue growth in its Azure cloud business as it reported earnings on Wednesday.Over 70% of existing Google Cloud customers use its AI products, Pichai said. That's a result of the company's strategy to upsell existing customers.Google's flagship AI app Gemini now has more than 650 million monthly active users, the company said in its Wednesday report. That's up from the 450 million active users Pichai said it had last quarter. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that ChatGPT now has 800 million users per week.Google's search business generated $56.56 billion in revenue — up 15% from the prior year.Alphabet's net income increased to $34.97 billion, or $2.87 per share, compared to $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share, in the year-ago quarter. In September, Google was slapped with a $3.45 billion antitrust fine from European Union regulators for anti-competitive practices in its lucrative advertising technology business. That fine impacted the reported net income.YouTube advertising revenue came in at $10.26 billion, higher than Wall Street expected. Alphabet reported overall advertising revenue of $74.18 billion — up from $65.85 billion last year.Other Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $344 million during the quarter. That's lower than the $388 million from the same quarter last year. Alphabet reported a loss of $1.42 billion on other bets, compared to a loss of $1.12 billion the year before.The Google parent's stock is up 45% so far this year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>BOE Interest-Rate Decision | Live Special Coverage</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPDxwtyPAWg</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EPDxwtyPAWg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:21:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bank of England is set to announce its decision on interest rates.

French media have been mocking Belgium for buying fighter jets that it will be unable to use for training exercises due to its airspace being too small, but this has always been taken into account, according to Belgian authorities.

Compatibility is often a conscious trade-off against bleeding-edge performance. In Ubuntu 25.10, we have added support for packages that target specific silicon variants, meaning you can have your cake and eat it too!Back in 2023 I wrote an article talking about the history of the / architecture and described the “levels” , , and  (often referred to as , , etc.). Since then, we’ve been working on a means to better exploit modern processors without compromising support for older hardware.To do this, we have added the concept of an “architecture variant.” By making changes to ,  and Launchpad, we are able to build multiple versions of a package, each for a different level of the  architecture, meaning we can have packages that specifically target , for example.As a result, we’re very excited to share that in Ubuntu 25.10, some packages are available, on an opt-in basis, in their optimized form for the more modern  architecture level.For 25.10 we were mostly focused on building the required infrastructure and have not yet rebuilt every package for the  /   architecture. Most packages in the  component have been rebuilt (around 2000 source packages). It is worth noting that these packages have not yet received the usual level of testing that most packages in Ubuntu receive. So while we expect them to work, early adopters might find some bugs.For the upcoming 26.04 LTS release, we will rebuild -enabled versions of all packages and test them in the same rigorous way as we test every other Ubuntu package.Previous benchmarks we have run (where we rebuilt the entire archive for x86-64-v3) show that most packages show a slight (around 1%) performance improvement and some packages, mostly those that are somewhat numerical in nature, improve more than that.The vast majority of cloud instance types and machines manufactured within the last ten years will support , and you can check for support on a machine like so:$ ld.so --help | grep '\-v[0-9]'
x86-64-v4 (supported, searched)
x86-64-v3 (supported, searched)
x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)
If your machine is supported, and you’d like to try out the new packages, you can opt-in to the -enabled packages. First, install the latest version of dpkg:$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install dpkg
Then enable amd64v3 and update the packages, like so:echo 'APT::Architecture-Variants "amd64v3";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99enable-amd64v3
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Note that  may print that it is “downgrading” these packages – this is just a cosmetic thing and will be fixed in 26.04 as well.If you do install the available  versions of packages, you will not be able to transfer your hard-drive/SSD to an older machine that does not support . Usually, we try to ensure that moving drives between systems like this would work. For 26.04 LTS, we’ll be working on making this experience cleaner, and hopefully provide a method of recovering a system that is in this state.We are very excited about the future of architecture variants and will keep you posted along the way. We hope that early adopters see some benefits of making the most of their hardware. Let us know how you get on!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Where in Europe do workers feel the most underpaid?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls5mJTwdf2U</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ls5mJTwdf2U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:28:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly half of European workers feel underpaid, but when the same question is asked to employers, the majority insist they’re paying fair salaries.

The tech giant also announced an increase in expected capital expenditures for the fiscal year of 2025. CNBC reports: "With the growth across our business and demand from Cloud customers, we now expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion to $93 billion," the company said in its earnings report (PDF) Wednesday. "Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx and will provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call," said finance chief Anat Ashkenazi on the earnings call with investors Wednesday.
 
Earlier this year, the company increased its capital expenditure expectation from $75 billion to $85 billion. Most of that goes toward technical infrastructure such as data centers. The latest earnings show the company is seeing rising demand for its AI services, which largely sit in its cloud unit. It also shows the company is continuing to spend more to try and build out more infrastructure to accomodate the backlog of customer requests. "We continue to drive strong growth in new businesses. Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog," CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD ROCm 7.1 Release Appears Imminent</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-ROCm-7.1-Imminent</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AMD continues with their aggressive efforts to enhance their GPU software compute ecosystem with ROCm.

SST introduces a noval approach by updating all singular values and selectively adjusting the singular vectors of network weights, optimizing resource utilization while closely mirroring the performance of full-rank training. Moreover, some areas that need further explorations are: (1) Investigating faster convergence approaches that avoid optimizer state reset (2) Extending the application of SST to the embeddings of large language models (LLMs).This research enhances the memory efficiency of training large language models (LLMs), which contributes positively by reducing the environmental impact and making LLM training accessible to researchers with limited resources. On the downside, the ease of access to powerful LLMs raises concerns about potential misuse [52, 53]. Careful consideration and management of these factors are essential to maximize the benefits and mitigate risks.[1] Jared Kaplan, Sam McCandlish, Tom Henighan, Tom B.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, Donald Trump said he had an “amazing” meeting with Xi Jinping in South Korea. The US reduced its tariffs on fentanyl to 10% immediately, and reached a deal on soybeans and agriculture. The US president said he’d discussed Nvidia chips, but that it’s up to Beijing to continue talking to the company about access to China. He plans to visit China in April. Xi said China will cooperate with the US.

A rate cut from the Fed, but a warning from chair Jay Powell there's no guarantee of another reduction in December. The Bank of Japan holds steady, while the ECB prepares to deliver its decision later today. Meanwhile, Meta and Microsoft shares have fallen in afterhours trading after the tech giants disclosed huge AI spending plans in their latest earnings reports.

Today's guests: ABN Amro Bank Senior Economist Jan-Paul van de Kerke, Diego Di Giorgi, CFO of Standard Chartered & Ana Boata, Head of Economic Research at Allianz Trade

All models are pre-trained on OpenWebText [39], an open-source reproduction of OpenAI’s WebText. To facilitate fair comparisons across different OPT model sizes, we standardize the total training tokens for all models at 19.7 billion. A consistent rank (r = 64) is applied for all low-rank methods.\
Table 3 displays the validation perplexity results on the OpenWebText dataset across different sizes of OPT models. The results indicate that SST not only achieves lower perplexity scores compared to LoRA and ReLoRA* but also approximates the performance of full-rank training, with significantly fewer trainable parameters.\
Figure 2 illustrates a comparison of effective steps among various training methods. The effective step metric, which considers both the number of trainable parameters and the number of training steps, demonstrates that SST offers a more efficient training approach compared to the full-rank method.\
Each pretrained model undergoes zero-shot evaluations on all 16 NLP tasks used in OPT article [9], including ARC Easy and Challenge [40], HellaSwag [41], OpenBookQA [42], PIQA [43], StoryCloze [44], SuperGLUE [45], WinoGrad [46], and WinoGrande [47]. Evaluations are conducted using the LM Evaluation Harness framework [48]. Except for the ReCoRD task, which uses F1 score, all other tasks are evaluated using accuracy.\
Table 4 details the zero-shot evaluation results across the 16 NLP tasks. SST consistently performs comparably or better than other low-rank methods and shows competitive performance against the full-rank models.\
We further conduct an analysis experiment on inference by doing post-training singular value pruning on SST model (see appendix G).5.3 Hyperbolic Graph Neural NetworksHyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) [11, 12] capitalize on the expansive and hierarchical nature of hyperbolic space to efficiently manage and analyze graph-structured data. This geometric space is particularly suitable for graphs due to its ability to closely mimic the underlying data structures with minimal distortion, offering a substantial improvement over traditional Euclidean methods.\
\
We evaluated the effectiveness of SST on HyboNet [12] version HGNN in node classification and link prediction across four distinct datasets: Airport [11], Cora [49], Disease [50], and PubMed [51]. Each experiment was conducted with three random seeds.\
\
The results, detailed in Table 5, demonstrate strong performance in both node classification and link prediction tasks. SST not only shows comparable performance to full-rank training (exceeding it in the Disease link prediction task) but also significantly outperforms LoRA at equivalent ranks. Notably, SST’s advantage over LoRA is larger on r = 1 than r = 2, likely due to SST’s sampling strategy being particularly effective in sparser scenarios.(1) Jialin Zhao, Center for Complex Network Intelligence (CCNI), Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence (THBI) and Department of Computer Science;(2) Yingtao Zhang, Center for Complex Network Intelligence (CCNI), Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence (THBI) and Department of Computer Science;(3) Xinghang Li, Department of Computer Science;(4) Huaping Liu, Department of Computer Science;(5) Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci, Center for Complex Network Intelligence (CCNI), Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence (THBI), Department of Computer Science, and Department of Biomedical Engineering Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.:::info

But how do planets get their water? An infant world might be bombarded by icy comets and waterlogged asteroids, for instance, or it could form far enough from its host star that water can precipitate as ice. However, certain exoplanets pose a puzzle to astronomers: alien worlds that closely orbit their scorching home stars yet somehow appear to hold significant amounts of water.
 
A new series of laboratory experiments, published today in Nature, has revealed a deceptively straightforward solution to this enigma: These planets make their own water. Using diamond anvils and pulsed lasers, researchers managed to re-create the intense temperatures and pressures present at the boundary between these planets' hydrogen atmospheres and molten rocky cores. Water emerged as the minerals cooked within the hydrogen soup. Because this kind of geologic cauldron could theoretically boil and bubble for billions of years, the mechanism could even give hellishly hot planets bodies of water -- implying that ocean worlds, and the potentially habitable ones among them, may be more common than scientists already thought. "They can basically be their own water engines," says Quentin Williams, an experimental geochemist at the University of California Santa Cruz who was not involved with the new work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump: ‘Amazing’ Xi Meeting Yielded Fentanyl Tariff Cut</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJjrsQ103M</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UTJjrsQ103M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 06:49:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump said he had an “amazing meeting” with Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a trade deal that would see the US halve fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods effective immediately.

Agencies and brands are massively switching to AI-generated creatives for performance campaigns. Everyone is convinced it's a breakthrough. But when you look at the numbers, you see the opposite. Conversions are dropping, cost per acquisition is growing, and the audience simply stops reacting to advertisingLast quarter I conducted an experiment for an e-commerce project, i launched two series of ads on Facebook. The first series was fully generated through ChatGPT following all optimization canons. the second was written by me manually, late in the evening, I even left a couple of typos intentionally. The result surprised me, although I was already starting to suspect this. Manual creatives gave 34 % better performance across all metrics..This isn't coincidence or statistical error. Basic neurophysiology of perception is at work here. The human brain is designed as a pattern recognition machine. There's research by Karl Friston on predictive processing theory. The essence is that the brain constantly tries to predict what will happen next to minimize surprise and conserve energy AI generated text has a very specific structure. It's mathematically precise, logically flawless, emotionally balanced. It's precisely this predictability that becomes the problem. The brain reads the pattern in fractions of a second and sends the information to the category "already seen not important, skip." In neuroscience, this is called habituation.When a human writes text they inevitably deviate from the ideal line. Somewhere they go off on a tangent, somewhere they return to the thought from a different angle, sometimes they use An unexpected metaphor. This creates what's called prediction error. The brain can't predict the next step, so it's forced to pay attention. There's a whole research direction at MIT Media Lab about so called "honest signals" in  communication. It turns out people subconsciously pick up micro patterns of authenticity. A real person can contradict themselves in different parts of the text. Can accidentally show uncertainty or excessive enthusiasm. AI maintains perfect balance always, and it's exactly this that's perceived as unnatural.Remember Masahiro Moris "uncanny valley" concept? When a robot becomes too similar to a human but something in it remains wrong, it causes subconscious rejection. The same mechanism works with texts. AI copywriting falls exactly into this valley. Good enough to look almost human, but the brain still senses something's off.I tested this on a LinkedIn campaign for a b2b client. Two ad variants with identical budget and targeting. The first generated by AI "Optimize workflows with our innovative platform. Over 10000 teams have already increased productivity." Standard, clean, professional text..The second I wrote myself "Our interface honestly won't win beauty contests. But it will save you four hours a week, which is why even design studios buy it" The second variant gave 63 % higher ctr and 41 % lower cost per lead. The reason is simple. Acknowledging imperfection works as a credibility signal. It proves text was written by a living person who actually stands behind the product and is willing to speak honestly. Over the past year, I analyzed data from 47 campaigns with a total budget of about a million dollars. I compared fully manual creatives with those where AI was used. The pattern consistently repeats. Ugc format on Instagram and Tik Tok. Polished AI versions show 0.8% ctr at $4.20 cost per action. Shot on phone and edited manually give 2.1 % ctr at $1.90 per action. Email marketing. AI written subject lines get 18 % opens. Manually written ones, including those with minor errors, get 31 % opens. Landing page headlines. Ai versions convert 2.3 % of visitors. Manual versions convert 4.1 %.This is explained by basic behavioral economics. People evaluate not the object itself, but the perceived investment in it. A handwritten letter is more valuable than a printed card not by content, but because someone spent time. A custom illustration beats a stock image for the same reason. Right now we're observing an interesting scarcity effect.. When most content is AI-generated, manual work automatically becomes premium. It's similar to how the word "organic" worked in food products ten years ago. A quality certificate that attracts attention.Your audience doesn't consciously analyze "did AI or a human write this." They just feel at an intuitive level that something's off. Research in neuromarketing shows that purchase decisions are made by emotional brain centers, and rational justification comes later. If a creative feels like a mass template, the limbic system rejects it before the person has consciously read your value proposition. I'm not calling to abandon AI completely. The question is understanding where manual work gives disproportionately high returns.First touch with the audience is critically important. UGC-style creatives, provocative hooks, visuals that stop scrolling. Here you need human unpredictability. AI averages by definition, and you need to stand out. Brand voice formation can't be automated. Ai is trained to be safe and neutral. But it's precisely sharp edges that create memorability and emotional connection. Key conversion points require maximum attention. Text on the payment page, main headline of a sales landing page, emails for warmed-up audience. It's exactly here that "roboticism" costs you actual money. Controversial or provocative messages by definition can't be generated by AI. The system is trained to avoid risks, but it's precisely risk that attracts attention and provokes action.At the same time, AI handles scaling tasks excellently. Need to create 50 variations of one creative for split tests? No problem. Supporting content like FAQ, instructions, SEO articles? Please. Initial drafts that are then refined manually? Very effective. Analysis of large data sets on campaign performance? Irreplaceable. The problem is that most specialists do exactly the opposite. They automate what requires humanity and spend time manually refining secondary content.This year I changed my approach to creating creatives. I deliberately leave elements of imperfection. In video ads, I dont cut out all pauses and stumbles .. they create a sense of naturalness. In email newsletters, I don't fix every minor error if it doesn't interfere with understanding. I use smartphone shooting instead of studio producton for UGC style content. On landing pages, we started indicating authorship: "Text written by Ivan Petrov, without using AI." In email signatures, we add "I really write these emails myself." In creatives, we show the creator, use hand-drawn elements instead of perfect graphics.I completely revised time allocation. 80 % goes to 20 % of content that actually impacts conversion. The remaining 20 % of time on mass content with AI help.. Every A/B test now includes a hypothesis about "deliberate imperfection." Results often surprise. A version with a typo can beat a cleaned up one. Conversational style with digressions outperforms structured copywriting.While everyone's chasing automation, an interesting opportunity opens up. Being real becomes expensive, which means valuable. This is basic scarcity economics. The brands that will win competition in the next couple of years aren't those with the most advanced AI tools. They're those who understood where to direct limited human attention for maximum effect. Your audience isn't just consuming content. They're looking for trust signals. And right now the strongest trust signal is proof that a person cared. That they created something specifically for them, not just generated from a template.That same typo in the email subject. An unexpected metaphor in an ad. A video where you lost your train of thought and came back to it differently. This isn't unprofessionalism, it’s a competitive advantage in a world where everyone else sounds the same. AI is indeed a powerful tool for scaling. But scale without authenticity is just expensive noise. In performance marketing, only one metric matters: conversion. And people convert people more effectively than algorithms.The paradox is that the more you optimize a creative with AI, the worse it works in practice.Information about the research kindly provided by our beloved AI. Use the tools correctly and have a good day :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JSON Was Killing Our Redis Memory. Switching Serialization Made It 7× Smaller.</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/json-was-killing-our-redis-memory-switching-serialization-made-it-7-smaller?source=rss</link><author>Yan Khachko</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 06:08:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We were running a large production service with about 10 million monthly active users, and Redis acted as the main storage for user state. Every record in Redis was a JSON-serialized Pydantic model. It looked clean and convenient – until it started to hurt.As we grew, our cluster scaled to , yet memory pressure only kept getting worse. JSON objects were inflating far beyond the size of the actual data, and we were literally paying for  – in cloud invoices, wasted RAM, and degraded performance.At some point I calculated the ratio of real payload to total storage, and the result made it obvious that we couldn’t continue like this:14,000 bytes per user in JSON → 2,000 bytes in a binary format
A  Just because of the serialization format.That’s when I built what eventually became  – a compact binary encoder/decoder for Pydantic models. And below is the story of how I got there, what didn’t work, and why the final approach made Redis (and our wallets) a lot happier.Why JSON Became a ProblemJSON is great as a universal exchange format. But inside a low-level cache, it turns into a :it stores field names in fullit stores types implicitly as stringsit duplicates structure over and overit’s not optimized for binary datait inflates RAM usage to  the size of the real payloadWhen you’re holding tens of millions of objects in Redis, this isn’t some academic inefficiency anymore – it’s a real bill and an extra server in the cluster. At scale, JSON stops being a harmless convenience and becomes a silent tax on memory.What Alternatives Exist (and Why They Didn’t Work)I went through the obvious candidates:| Format | Why It Failed in Our Case |
|----|----|
|  | Too much ceremony: separate schemas, code generation, extra tooling, and a lot of friction for simple models |
|  | More compact than JSON, but still not enough – and integrating it cleanly with Pydantic was far from seamless |
|  | Smaller than JSON, but the Pydantic integration story was still clumsy and not worth the hassle |All of these formats are good in general. But for the specific scenario of “Pydantic + Redis as a state store” they felt like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut – heavy, noisy, and with barely any real relief in memory usage.I needed a solution that would:drop into the existing codebase with just a couple of linesdeliver a radical reduction in memory usageavoid any extra DSLs, schemas, or code generationwork directly with Pydantic models without breaking the ecosystemSo I ended up writing a minimalist binary format with a lightweight encoder/decoder on top of annotated Pydantic models. That’s how  was born.Its API is intentionally designed so that you can drop it in with almost no friction — in most cases, you just replace calls like:model.serialize()        # replaces .model_dump_json()
Model.deserialize(bytes) # replaces .model_validate_json()
from pybyntic import AnnotatedBaseModel
from pybyntic.types import UInt32, String, Bool
from typing import Annotated

class User(AnnotatedBaseModel):
    user_id:   Annotated[int, UInt32]
    username:  Annotated[str, String]
    is_active: Annotated[bool, Bool]

data = User(
    user_id=123,
    username="alice",
    is_active=True
)

raw = data.serialize()
obj = User.deserialize(raw)
Optionally, you can also provide a custom compression function:import zlib

serialized = user.serialize(encoder=zlib.compress)

deserialized_user = User.deserialize(serialized, decoder=zlib.decompress)
For a fair comparison, I generated  based on our real production models. Each user object contained a mix of fields – , , , , , , , and . On top of that, every user also had  such as roles and permissions, and in some cases there could be hundreds of permissions per user. In other words, this was not a synthetic toy example — it was a realistic dataset with deeply nested structures and a wide range of field types.The chart shows how much memory Redis consumes when storing  using different serialization formats. JSON is used as the baseline at approximately . PyByntic turned out to be the most compact option — just , which is about . Protobuf and MessagePack also offer a noticeable improvement over JSON, but in absolute numbers they still fall far behind PyByntic.Let's compare what this means for your cloud bill:| Format | Price of Redis on GCP |
|----|----|
| JSON | $876/month |
|  |  |
| MessagePack | $380/month |
| BSON | $522/month |
| Protobuf | $187/month |This calculation is based on storing 2,000,000 user objects using Memorystore for Redis Cluster on Google Cloud Platform. The savings are significant – and they scale even further as your load grows.The huge memory savings come from two simple facts: binary data doesn’t need a text format, and it doesn’t repeat structure on every object. In JSON, a typical datetime is stored as a string like "1970-01-01T00:00:01.000000" – that’s , and since each ASCII character is , a single timestamp costs . In binary, a  takes just , making it  with zero formatting overhead.The same applies to numbers. For example,  () in JSON takes , while the binary representation is a fixed . And finally, JSON keeps repeating field names for every single object, thousands or millions of times. A binary format doesn’t need that — the schema is known in advance, so there’s no structural tax on every record.Those three effects – no strings, no repetition, and no formatting overhead – are exactly where the size reduction comes from.If you’re using Pydantic and storing state in Redis, then JSON is a luxury you pay a  for. A binary format that stays compatible with your existing models is simply a more rational choice.For us,  became exactly that — a  that didn’t break anything, but eliminated an entire class of problems and unnecessary overhead.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hungary&apos;s complicated enlargement policy: No to Ukraine, yes to the Western Balkans</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4PqwfWgads</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/c4PqwfWgads?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 06:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hungary's complicated enlargement policy: No to Ukraine, yes to the Western Balkans

Flaky tests feel small at first, but their collective cost is high. They silently inflate Change Failure Rate (CFR), slow releases, and drain hours in CI time that could’ve gone into real product work.That’s why the shift toward AI-generated, self-healing test flows and disciplined quarantine practices is becoming more than a convenience, it’s strategic. Done right, this approach doesn’t replace QA; it strengthens engineering feedback loops, trims false failures, and restores confidence in test signals.Why Flakes Hurt More Than You ThinkWhat a “flaky test” actually is (and isn’t)In academic and industrial literature, a flaky test is defined as “a test that passes and fails under the same conditions, without any code change.”It’s not a slow test, a wrong test, or an unstable environment, it’s a  that makes teams doubt every other one.That definition matters. Without clarity, teams end up masking real issues with retries or marking legitimate defects as “flake.” Policies like  or  only make sense when everyone agrees on what a flake actually is.Every false red triggers a rerun. Every rerun adds minutes. And every minute multiplies across developers and builds. Eventually, flaky tests stop being a testing issue and become a pipeline-throughput problem.Under the DORA framework, these inefficiencies hit two key metrics: (how quickly code moves from commit to deploy)Change failure rate (CFR) (how often a change causes a failure that needs fixing)Flakes inflate both. When you can’t trust the red, developers hesitate to merge. Some rerun; others skip validation altogether. Either way the confidence erodes and velocity slows down.Recent large-scale studies underline this:Multi-project academic reviews (White Rose Research Online; ACM Digital Library) noted a strong correlation between resource constraints and flake density, the busier the pipelines, the higher the flakiness.16–25% of tests in large-scale CI systems show intermittent behavior.Some remain quarantined for , creating “dead weight” suites that still consume compute.Teams report spending 10–20% of their CI minutes re-running or verifying suspected flakes.The takeaway: flaky tests aren’t just noise; they’re a  on delivery speed.Measuring the Drag: From Pipeline Pain to Business ImpactQuantifying the cost brings clarity and urgency.You only need four numbers: (% of CI runs failing due to flakes)Number of developers affectedWasted CI hours (per week) =
flake_rate × reruns_per_flake × job_time_hours × developers × jobs_per_dev_per_week
Example A (conservative): 5% flake rate × 1 rerun × 0.33 h (20 min) × 15 devs × 25 jobs/dev/week ≈  lost. 5% × 1 × 0.33 h × 15 devs × 100 jobs/dev/week ≈  lost.If your CI has a 5 % flake rate, each failed job takes 20 minutes to rerun, and 15 developers are running jobs daily so you’re losing roughly 25 hours of productive time per week for re-runs.Signs that your suite is showing :A test passes and fails under the same SHARetry counts climbing in CIVariance in execution time across identical runsMismatched artifacts or screenshots between “fail” and “pass” statesPractitioners on DEV Community emphasize the same: if you can reproduce a failure inconsistently, you’re not debugging the app, you’re debugging the test.Tie it to DORA and CFR explicitlyThe   Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, and Mean Time to Restore. These are now industry-standard signals of delivery health (dora.dev).Flaky tests distort two of them: repeated runs delay usable feedback. false failures inflate “changes that fail,” even when nothing is wrong.Teams that invested in  and  consistently report sharper signal quality. faster time to first useful fail, and fewer spurious rollbacks. In one internal AI QA-assisted pilot, stabilizing critical test flows cut average “time-to-green” by over 40% without increasing suite size.Why it matters beyond engineeringEach false red doesn’t just waste CI minutes, it delays value delivery.When real bugs slip through or releases stall, the ripple reaches customers. PwC’s 2024 Customer Experience survey found that 32% of users would abandon a brand after a single bad experience.That turns test stability into a . Every noisy test not only burns time, it risks trust as well.What Actually Works: AI-Generated, Self-Healing Flows (+ Human Guardrails)After you’ve measured the drag and accepted that flakiness is a system cost, the question becomes: what actually fixes it without slowing development down?AI QA doesn’t fit as a magic button, but as a loop combining discovery, self-healing, and human oversight.Where AI fits in the loop1. Autonomous flow discoveryModern QA teams spend weeks writing end-to-end scripts for flows that users may never trigger again. AI shortens that loop by learning from analytics and usage to map real critical paths like checkout flows, signup journeys, or dashboard actions that truly matter.Instead of guessing which flows need coverage, the system starts with what customers actually do, ensuring tests align with business value.2. Selector robustness & self-healingDOMs shift. Classes change. Async waits stretch by milliseconds. Traditional scripts snap under those changes.An AI-based test agent continuously monitors DOM mutations and timing patterns, then auto-repairs selectors when they drift. This means your tests evolve with the product, not against it.Platforms like  use a similar principle, dynamically adapting selectors and synchronization waits so that non-critical UI shifts don’t trigger false reds. It’s not about skipping validation, it’s about maintaining determinism when change is expected.3. Daily human QA review (the hybrid discipline)No AI model should act unchecked in CI. The best setups combine  and a “human-in-the-loop” process.QA engineers review generated flows, confirm that repaired selectors still reflect user intent, and quarantine any borderline cases.This human guardrail keeps the test corpus trustworthy while letting AI handle the mechanical grind.The quarantine disciplineEven with AI help, flake prevention needs process. The industry-standard playbook is simple but strict:Fail → Reproduce? → Quarantine → Fix data/selector → Return to suite
this approach isolates noise before it pollutes the main signal.The target benchmark most mature teams aim for:Anything beyond that, and your CI metrics start lying. Quarantine isn’t punishment, it’s the mechanism that keeps your CFR honest.Picture the feedback loop as a swimlane:Developer → CI → AI Agent → CI → Dev/QA → Quarantine → MergeA developer commits code.CI triggers the AI agent to generate or repair relevant test flows.The AI layer stabilizes selectors and waits, executes the run, and posts only  back to CI.Dev/QA triage those signals, fixing actual regressions or isolating confirmed flakes.Clean tests merge back; noisy ones go to quarantine for review.The result: the pipeline stays green for the right reasons.Instead of blocking merges on a noisy suite, advanced setups use AI-test confidence scores to gate only high-risk changes.A deterministic fail halts a merge; a quarantined or low-confidence fail flags review but doesn’t stop delivery.That balance of  is what turns QA from a bottleneck into an early-warning system.Every stable CI system you’ve ever admired started small. The trick isn’t to automate everything on day one, it’s to create a feedback loop that Below is a simple two-sprint plan any engineering team can run without disrupting releases.Sprint 0 : Prep and BaselineBefore touching any AI or automation, you need to measure the . Treat this sprint as your “before” snapshot.1. Instrument your CI metrics (percentage of runs that fail inconsistently)Time-to-first-useful-signal (commit → first deterministic fail)Change Failure Rate (CFR) and Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)If you already use DORA’s “four keys,” this will feel familiar. You’re essentially setting up your QA metrics to speak the same language as your delivery metrics.2. Label and isolate recurring flakesRun a week of builds, tag recurring tests that fail intermittently, and classify causes (data, timing, selector). This is your “flake map.”3. Choose the pilot surfaceSelect  that truly affect customers, not obscure edge cases. Checkout, onboarding, or billing are good starting points.These flows should already have partial test coverage and predictable test data.4. Set the success criteria upfront“Flake rate reduced below 3%”“Time-to-green < 15 minutes”“Zero increase in CFR during rollout”This gives you measurable proof later that your changes improved signal quality, not just added complexity.Sprint 1 : Pilot: AI + QuarantineWith your baseline in hand, introduce the AI layer  your existing suite.1. Parallelize, don’t replaceRun AI-generated tests in parallel with your traditional scripts. The goal is comparison, not replacement. You want to see whether the AI maintains determinism across multiple runs.2. Enable selective self-healingAllow the AI to repair selectors and waits only for designated flows. Keep logs of each repair so that QA can audit the reasoning.In internal Bug0-assisted runs, this controlled rollout is where signal stability jumps first, because you’re no longer debugging minor UI drifts.Fail → Reproduce? → Quarantine → Fix → Return
Quarantined tests should be tracked in a lightweight dashboard (a spreadsheet works fine). The key is visibility, developers need to see which tests are “pending trust.”Lead time (commit → green build)Flake rate trend over daysNumber of deterministic vs. indeterminate failsYou’re not optimizing for volume yet, just .Sprint 2 : Rollout and ScaleOnce the pilot proves stable, expand to cover the next tier of flows.Add new flows incrementally: dashboards, search, file uploads or anything with high user traffic or frequent UI changes.Use the pilot’s AI config as your template for retries, selectors, and async handling.2. Integrate AI signal into merge gatesShift your CI gating logic:Deterministic fail → Block mergeLow-confidence / quarantined fail → Flag for reviewThis approach ensures CFR reflects genuine issues, not noise from uncertain tests.3. Automate selector validationSchedule nightly runs where the AI re-verifies repaired selectors against current builds. This “selector drift audit” keeps your automation future-proof.4. Expand reporting to DORA dashboardConnect your QA metrics to whatever platform visualizes your DORA keys.When leadership sees  and , the ROI conversation becomes straightforward.5. Continuous human reviewEven after automation stabilizes, maintain a small QA checkpoint each sprint, five minutes daily to review new auto-repairs or quarantines.That’s what keeps AI QA from drifting into “black box” territory.You don’t fix flakiness by throwing more tests at it. You fix it by shortening the feedback loop and increasing the reliability of every red signal.Two sprints of deliberate setup and review can turn a noisy, reactive pipeline into one that engineers actually trust.When AI helps shoulder the maintenance and humans keep the compass straight. Test automation stops being busywork and becomes an accelerator.Flaky tests aren’t just a testing nuisance, they’re an organizational drag. They inflate Change Failure Rate, erode confidence, and blur the line between “real failure” and “random noise.” The combination of AI-driven, self-healing tests and disciplined quarantine practices offers a practical path out.By grounding test automation in DORA metrics and business outcomes, teams can finally quantify what stability is worth :  faster releases, lower rework, and higher customer trust.And while AI plays a growing role, the teams that win are those that balance automation with human judgment.In the end, cleaner signals lead to calmer engineers and calmer engineers ship faster.Chrome & industry findings:Real-world studies on flake lifetime, resource constraints, and prioritization impacts.Practitioner cost & mechanics:Field-tested approaches to managing flaky suites and CI drag.The four key DevOps metrics that link speed and stability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Challenges in Building Natural, Low‑Latency, Reliable Voice Assistants</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/challenges-in-building-natural-lowlatency-reliable-voice-assistants?source=rss</link><author>Surya Appini</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:58:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Voice is the most helpful interface when your hands and eyes are busy, and the least forgiving when it lags or mishears. This article focuses on the real‑world blockers that make assistants feel robotic, how to measure them, and the engineering patterns that make voice interactions feel like a conversation.Humans process and respond in ~200–300 ms. Anything slower feels laggy or robotic. Meanwhile, real‑world audio is messy: echo-prone kitchens, car cabins at 70 mph, roommates talking over you, code‑switching (“Set an alarm at saat baje”). To feel natural, a voice system must:: Far‑field capture, beamforming, echo cancellation, and noise suppression feeding streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) with strong diarization and voice activity detection (VAD).: Incremental natural language understanding (NLU) that updates intent as transcripts stream; support disfluencies, partial words, and barge‑in corrections.Respond without awkward pauses: Streaming text-to-speech (TTS) with low prosody jitter and smart endpointing so replies start  the user finishes.: Repair strategies (“Did you mean…?”), confirmations for destructive actions, and short‑term memory for context.: Begin speaking ~150–250 ms after the user stops, at p95,  keep p99 under control with pre‑warm and shedding.: Let users cut in anytime; pause TTS, checkpoint state, resume or revise mid‑utterance.: Offer top‑K clarifications and slot‑level fixes so users don’t repeat the whole request.: Keep working (alarms, timers, local media, cached facts) when connectivity blips; reconcile on resume.Stay consistent across contexts: Handle rooms, cars, TV bleed, and multiple speakers with diarization and echo references.Core challenges (and how to tackle them)Designing Voice‑Only Interaction and Turn‑Taking Most real use happens when your hands and eyes are busy, cooking, driving, working out. If the assistant doesn’t know when to speak or listen, it feels awkward fast. The assistant starts talking right as you finish, uses tiny earcons/short lead‑ins instead of long preambles, and remembers quick references like “that one.” Think of the conversation as a simple state machine that supports overlapping turns. Tune endpointing and prosody so the assistant starts speaking as the user yields the floor, and keep a small working memory for references and quick repairs (for example, “actually, 7 not 11”)., . A/B prosody and earcons.Achieving Ultra‑Low Latency for Real‑Time Interaction Humans expect a reply within ~300 ms. Anything slower feels like talking to a call center Interactive Voice Response (IVR). You stop, it speaks, consistently. p95 end‑of‑speech to first‑audio ≤ 300 ms; p99 doesn’t spike. Set a latency budget for each hop (device → edge → cloud). Stream the pipeline end to end: automatic speech recognition (ASR) partials feed incremental natural language understanding (NLU), which starts streaming text‑to‑speech (TTS). Detect the end of speech early and allow late revisions. Keep the first hop on the device, speculate likely tool or large language model (LLM) results, cache aggressively, and reserve graphics processing unit (GPU) capacity for short jobs.end‑of‑speech to first‑audio p95/p99. Pre‑warm hot paths; shed non‑critical work under load.Keeping Responses Short and Relevant Rambling answers tank trust, and make users reach for their phone. One‑breath answers by default; details only when asked (“tell me more”). Set clear limits on text‑to‑speech (TTS) length and speaking rate, and summarize tool outputs before speaking. Use a dialog policy that delivers the answer first and only adds context when requested, with an explicit “tell me more” path for deeper detail.,  (how often users say “what?”).Handling Interruptions and Barge‑In People change their minds mid‑sentence. If the assistant cannot stop and pivot gracefully, the conversation breaks. You interrupt and it immediately pauses, preserves context, and continues correctly. It never confuses its own voice for yours. Make text‑to‑speech (TTS) fully interruptible. Maintain an echo reference so automatic speech recognition (ASR) ignores the assistant’s audio. Provide slot‑level repair turns, and ask for confirmation only when the action is risky or confidence is low. Offer clear top‑K clarifications (for example, Alex versus Alexa). and , tested on noisy, real‑room audio.Filtering Background and Non‑Directed Speech Living rooms have televisions, kitchens have clatter, and offices have coworkers. False accepts are frustrating and feel invasive. It wakes for you—not for the television—and it ignores side chatter and off‑policy requests. Combine voice activity detection (VAD), speaker diarization, and the wake word, tuned per room profile. Use an echo reference from device playback. Add intent gating to reject low‑entropy, non‑directed speech. Keep privacy‑first defaults: on‑device hotword detection, ephemeral transcripts, and clear indicators when audio leaves the device. and Non‑directed speech rejection, sliced by room and device.Ensuring Reliability with Intermittent Connectivity Networks fail—elevators, tunnels, and congested Wi‑Fi happen. The assistant still needs to help. Timers fire, music pauses, and quick facts work offline. When the connection returns, longer tasks resume without losing state. Provide offline fallbacks (alarms, timers, local media, cached retrieval‑augmented generation facts). Use jitter buffers, forward error correction (FEC), retry budgets, and circuit breakers for tools. Persist short‑term dialog state so interactions resume cleanly.Degraded‑mode success rate and .Managing Power Consumption and Battery Life On wearables, the best feature is a battery that lasts. Without power, there is no assistant. All‑day standby, a responsive first hop, and no surprise drains. Keep the first hop on the device with duty‑cycled microphones. Use frame‑skipping encoders and context‑aware neural codecs. Batch background synchronization, cache embeddings locally, and keep large models off critical cores.Milliwatts (mW) per active minute, Watt‑hours (Wh) per successful task, and .Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Track Word Error Rate (WER) by domain, accent, noise condition, and device, along with intent and slot F1.

Natural voice assistants emerge when capture, ASR, NLU, policy, tools, and TTS are engineered to stream together, fail gracefully, and respect ruthless latency budgets.

Today they plan trips, read docs, and control your home. Tomorrow they will see the world, reason about it, and take safe actions. Here’s a quick tour.Quick primer: types of voice assistantsHere’s a simple way to think about voice assistants. Ask four questions, then you can place almost any system on the map. General helpers for everyday tasks, or purpose built bots for support lines, cars, and hotels. Cloud only, fully on device, or a hybrid that splits work across both. One shot commands, back and forth task completion, or agentic assistants that plan steps and call tools. Voice only, voice with a screen, or multimodal systems that combine voice with vision and direct device control.We’ll use this simple map as we walk through the generations.Generation 1 - Voice Assistant Pipeline Era (Past)Think classic ASR glued to rules. You say something, the system finds speech, converts it to text, parses intent with templates, hits a hard‑coded action, then speaks back. It worked, but it was brittle and every module could fail on its own. GMM/HMM to DNN/HMM, then CTC and RNN‑T for streaming. Plus the plumbing that matters in practice: wake word, VAD, beam search, punctuation. Rules and regex to statistical classifiers, then neural encoders that tolerate paraphrases. Entity resolution maps names to real contacts, products, and calendars. Finite‑state flows to frame‑based, then simple learned policies. Barge‑in so users can interrupt. Concatenative to parametric to neural vocoders. Natural prosody, with a constant speed vs realism tradeoff.How teams trained and served itNarrow intent sets. Anything off the happy path failed.ASR → NLU → Dialog error cascades derailed turns.Multiple services added hops and serialization, raising latency.Personalization and context lived in silos, rarely end to end.Multilingual and far‑field audio pushed complexity and error rates up.Great for timers and weather, weak for multi‑step tasks.The center of gravity moved to large language models with strong speech frontends. Assistants now understand messy language, plan steps, call tools and APIs, and ground answers using your docs or knowledge bases. picks the right API at the right time. grabs fresh, relevant context so answers are grounded. stream ASR and TTS, prewarm tools, strict timeouts, sane fallbacks. unified home standards cut brittle adapters.Long‑running and multi‑session tasks.Guaranteed correctness and traceability.Private on‑device operation for sensitive data.Cost and throughput at scale.Generation 3 - Multimodal, Agentic Voice Assistants for Robotics (Future)Next up: assistants that can see, reason, and act. Vision‑language‑action models fuse perception with planning and control. The goal is a single agent that understands a scene, checks safety, and executes steps on devices and robots. fuse vision and audio with language for real‑world grounding. reusable controllers for grasp, navigate, and UI/device control. simulate, check policies, then act. run core understanding on device, offload selectively. warehouses, hospitality, healthcare, and prosumer robotics. Also smarter homes that actually follow through on tasks instead of just answering questions.Closing: the road to JarvisJarvis isn’t only a brilliant voice. It is grounded perception, reliable tool use, and safe action across digital and physical spaces. We already have fast ASR, natural TTS, LLM planning, retrieval for facts, and growing device standards. What’s left is serious work on safety, evaluation, and low‑latency orchestration that scales.Practical mindset: build assistants that do small things flawlessly, then chain them. Keep humans in the loop where stakes are high. Make privacy the default, not an afterthought. Do that, and a Jarvis‑class assistant driving a humanoid robot goes from sci‑fi to a routine launch.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Ways Async Work Builds a More Flexible and Inclusive Workplace</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/5-ways-async-work-builds-a-more-flexible-and-inclusive-workplace?source=rss</link><author>Elena Skvortsova</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:54:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Return-to-office rates have steadied, yet flexibility still ranks in the top three reasons people switch jobs, right beside pay and growth, according to recent McKinsey research. Another study also shows that employees thrive when they are allowed to work from home.Many frame flexibility around where we sit or when we log on. Besides the hours and location, the missing piece is how we collaborate. That is where asynchronous (async) work, or the practice of working where communication is not expected to be immediate, changes the game.Here are five ways async work is helping us build a more flexible, inclusive, human-first workplace for our global team – and how it could do the same for yours.1. Making communication more equitableTraditional meetings often reward speed over substance. Researchers call this the “extrovert bias” – fast or forceful speakers shape decisions while quieter colleagues struggle to break in. That bias hurts innovation by filtering out slower-burn ideas.Async work flips the dynamic:Written updates replace live monologues. Everyone drafts thoughts at their own pace and edits before posting.Recorded demos pause for reflection. Teammates respond with time-stamped comments, not knee-jerk reactions.Inclusive dialogue widens the talent pool. A study found that asynchronous communication boosted participation for introverts and non-native speakers across distributed teams.When voices rise by merit, not volume, better ideas surface.2. Enabling real scheduling flexibilityNine-to-five suits payroll software, not people’s lives. McKinsey data show workers prize flexible hours and greater control over their time as much as location choice.Async workflows replace fixed shifts with outcome-based expectations:Parents can handle the morning school run and log in afterward.Caregivers pause to attend appointments without losing pay.Employees managing chronic conditions arrange tasks around energy spikes – a benefit disability consultant at CMA highlights as “leveling the playing field”.Because deliverables, not desk time, measure success, everyone gains autonomy to plan work when they feel sharpest. That freedom encourages accountability – nobody hides behind a “busy” status light.3. Supporting cognitive diversityBrains process information in wildly different ways: some spark in rapid white-board sessions; others need quiet thinking blocks. Async practices nurture both. Team members bundle tasks into long, uninterrupted stretches or short, focused bursts.Reduced sensory overload. Remote.com’s 2025 insight report notes that many neurodivergent professionals thrive when they can curate their environment and limit spontaneous calls. A Fortune study found 59 percent of office workers cannot stay focused for 30 minutes in a typical setting – endless pings pull them off track.By lowering noise – literal and figurative – async structures let every cognitive style hit its stride.4. Protecting work-life balanceAlways-on culture breeds burnout. The expectation of immediate replies blurs boundaries until evenings looks like extended afternoons.Async norms restore balance through clear response windows and documented workflows. Teams using async methods report lower stress because they control when they engage instead of reacting on command. This flexibility helps address a root cause of burnout.Some principles we adopted at Muse Group are:Giving teammates up to 72 hours to respond thoughtfully;Encouraging written communication – team decisions live in a decision log and many of those advance in writing without a single meeting;Setting clear accountability structures and a culture of action – at the team’s chosen pace, but within agreed SLAs.When people own their clocks, recovery and deep focus can coexist.5. Giving creative minds space to thriveCreative work – coding a new audio engine or arranging a jazz chart – demands deep focus that constant notifications typically shatter. Harvard Business Review found that asynchronous teams produced more original solutions because contributors iterated privately before sharing polished ideas.Async work protects the “flow state”. A concept taken from positive psychology, ‘flow’ is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in the activity, feeling energized and focused. We make every Wednesday a no-meeting day to help our team reach this state. As a result, 88 percent of our surveyed employees say they can concentrate without distraction, 79 percent find it easier to tackle complex projects, and 62 percent report higher-quality output.The outcome is fewer meetings and richer deliverables – because creators spend more time creating.Asynchronous work is not a silver bullet, yet it shifts focus from presence to performance, unlocking benefits that standard hybrid schedules miss: – written forums dampen extrovert bias. – individuals sync work with life, not vice versa. – neurodivergent and introverted teammates thrive. – less “on call” pressure curbs burnout. – long focus windows spark better ideas.By moving away from the assumption that everyone must work in the same way and letting employees actually choose how they work, companies can strengthen flexibility and foster a culture where people are empowered to do their best work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>12 Best Zapier Integrations to Automate Your Freelance Business</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/12-best-zapier-integrations-to-automate-your-freelance-business?source=rss</link><author>bernarrrrddd</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:53:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s just 9:00 am, and your computer is already a mess. Notion’s packed with active deliverables, Gmail’s flooded with client messages, invoices are yet to be sent out, and you still haven’t started the real work you’re paid for.Overwhelming, right? I’ve been there.That’s exactly why I started letting Zapier handle the boring parts of my freelance life. It connects all the tools I use and automates repetitive tasks, saving my time and energy for creative work.In this article, I’ll introduce you to the best Zapier integrations for freelancers and how they can streamline your workflow, saving you hours of .What is a Zapier integration?Zapier integrations connect all the apps you use as a freelancer — from Gmail and Notion to Slack and Google Drive — so they can automatically work together. It’s like a digital assistant that handles repetitive admin tasks so you can focus on technical work that pays you.To make this happen, connected apps follow a simple  system. That is, when something happens in one app (the trigger), Zapier makes something else happen in another app (the action). Each of these automated workflows is called a .Here’s how it works: say you want to automate client meeting confirmation, you can create a Zap that’s triggered when a client books a meeting through Calendly, then sends a confirmation email to both of you.Best Zapier integrations for freelancersAutomate client onboardingCreate projects and tasksTurn emails into tasks and to-dosSync notes and deliverables across toolsTrack your billable hoursGenerate and send invoicesAutomate social media postsOrganize and back up your filesZapier makes freelancing easier by connecting your tools to automate the tasks above. Here’s a breakdown of the 12 best integrations Zapier offers to simplify your workflow and help you manage your time better.New client inquiries feel exciting until you realize most don’t know what they want or can’t afford your service. Sorting through piles of inquiries only to find a few, or even none, that fit can be time-wasting and disappointing. You can prevent these by automating your lead qualification process with Zapier.For example, you can create a zap that sends new Typeform inquiries directly to Airtable or Google Sheets. From there, Zapier can automatically filter reasonable budgets or relevant projects based on the answers they submit. You can even set it to send follow-up emails to qualified leads through Gmail.2. Schedule client meetingsThe back-and-forth that comes with scheduling client meetings can be unbearable. You send your available times, they choose another time, then someone cancels at the last minute or asks for a reschedule. Gladly, Zapier offers integrations that make meeting scheduling less of a chore.For example, you can add a zap that generates a Zoom link when a client books a slot, adds the meeting to your Google Calendar, and forwards a confirmation email to both of you. If the client reschedules, everything updates automatically.3. Automate client onboardingYour client onboarding process shouldn’t mean a mess of emails, shared links, and repetitive explanations. With Zapier, you can recover hours spent on sending welcome messages, creating project folders, and sharing onboarding documents.For example, you can create a zap that sends automated welcome emails immediately after a client signs your proposal in DocuSign, creates a new project folder in Google Drive, and adds their details to Trello or Notion for tracking.4. Create projects and tasksManually creating tasks and organizing new projects takes time, especially when you are handling multiple clients. Interestingly, Zapier can help. From  to adding due dates and updating calendars, it can all be automated with just one zap.For instance, Zapier can automatically add a new Trello card or Asana task whenever a client fills out a project form or approves a brief.  In addition, it can tag a project name, assign a due date, and update your Google Calendar to keep everything in sync.5. Turn emails into tasks and to-dosClients' requests can easily get lost in a crowded inbox filled with newsletters and follow-ups. And before you know it, you miss a deadline. Luckily, Zapier fixes this by automatically turning essential emails into tasks you can easily track.For example, you can set up a zap that creates a new task in Todoist or Notion whenever you star or label an email as “Action Needed” in Gmail. You can also include due dates or reminders.Keeping your notes, drafts, and deliverables consistent across different tools can be exhausting. But Zapier can sync materials across all your apps.For instance, Zapier can automatically save new Notion notes or files to Google Drive, then send a Slack notification when updates occur.7. Track your billable hoursTracking how much time you actually spend on a project isn’t always straightforward. Hours spent on research, brainstorming angles, and context switching often go unaccounted for. To fix this, Zapier connects your time-tracking app to all the tools you use and automatically documents your workflow from ideation to completion.For instance, Zapier can record every new time entry from Toogl Track or Clockify into Google Sheets, along with notes on what you were working on. You can even send daily summaries to Notion or Slack to see precisely how much time was spent on research, brainstorming, and delivery.8. Generate and send invoicesOne of the best moments in freelancing is when payday is near. However, creating and sending invoices can quickly ruin that excitement. Interestingly, Zapier protects your joy by automating the entire invoice drafting and sending process, and youFor instance, you can add a zap that automatically creates an invoice in FreshBooks whenever you mark a Trello card as “Done”. Then it sends the invoice to your client via Gmail and logs the record in Google Sheets for tracking.As freelancers, we wear every hat, even the accountant’s. Tracking payments, recording expenses, and managing cash flow can be draining, especially with multiple clients and payment platforms. Zapier takes the grind out of your bookkeeping and .As an example, you can set up Zapier to automatically record every PayPal transaction in QuickBooks or Google Sheets, then send a Slack notification or Gmail alert so you always know when money flows in and out.10. Send follow-up emailsFollowing up can be tough to manage; remembering who to follow up with, why, and when can get overwhelming. Zapier makes it a breeze by automating your follow-ups, so every client hears from you at the right time.For instance, a zap can automatically send friendly check-ins a few days after submitting a project with no client feedback.11. Automate social media postsBuilding visibility and growing your online network help freelancers attract dream clients. But posting regularly can be a full-time job. Good thing you can also automate this with Zapier.For example, you can add a zap that shares a post on LinkedIn or X (Twitter) whenever you publish a new blog or make an update to your portfolio, or complete a project.12. Organize and back up your filesYour files, drafts, and deliverables can easily get cluttered across different apps, which makes it hard to stay organized. Zapier automatically saves and backs up everything to the right locations.For example, you can add a zap that saves every new Gmail attachment or uploaded draft to a specific Google Drive folder, then tag it in Notion or Slack for quick access later.Make freelancing more fulfilling with Zapier integrationsFreelancing offers the freedom to control your time, but endless admin work can make this promise feel out of reach. That’s why you should get started with Zapier today.By automating the repetitive parts of your work, Zapier helps you get closer to the freedom-filled freelance life you imagined when you started. You don’t need to automate everything at once, just begin with one simple Zap, like turning your important emails into to-dos.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Tasks to Thinking Systems: Why Automation Starts in the Mind, Not the Machine</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/from-tasks-to-thinking-systems-why-automation-starts-in-the-mind-not-the-machine?source=rss</link><author>Yuliia Harkusha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:51:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A reflection on why true automation starts with human thinking, not technology.

Every new day, something new comes in that is revolutionizing healthcare and healthtech as a whole. And AI in the healthcare industry it's not new. It's evolved from very early clinical decision support to predictive analysis, to digital diagnostics, and is now also building generative tools for documentation and patient communication.There is EHR automation, radiology, and even predictive modeling. We have built intelligence to predict outcomes, code charts, but not deliver what patients need when they need it. That is the real challenge that health tech AI has right now. It comes across as a smarter algorithm, but all it is is just a smarter enablement.But in reality, what actually happens in today's system of healthtech?So, assume a patient goes to a doctor with some sort of symptoms. The doctor examines them, diagnoses them using all “next gen” intelligence and generative AI tools, and they get diagnosed. It turns out that they have a chronic disorder. AI and tech have helped us find and identify the problem.But what happens after that? What happens after a diagnosis is made? When a prescription is written, or when a therapy is recommended, or when an intervention is needed for that patient? Just the diagnosis is not going to treat the patient. Diagnosis plus care, plus actual medication and therapy, is what really treats the patient.Roughly  of prescriptions are never filled. That radically increases the chances of re-hospitalization, conditions getting worse, or patients completely dropping out of treatments. A big part of this is caused due to missing links in the supply chain, the weak link that becomes incredibly costly and damaging when it breaks. Cold chain failures alone cost more than $35 billion globally every year.Even though through all the diagnoses, all the AI, and all the tech were used, just treating the patient is not about the diagnosis. This is a system design failure, not a logistical one. It's disjointed data, no visibility from the provider, pharmacy, and limited patient-side intelligence, all turn into a design failure. AI models stop at the EHR boundary; they optimize clinical flow, but not operational execution. And that leads to the delivery chain lagging in interoperability and real-time feedback loops.We have digitized diagnosis, but left the delivery analog.Why Last-Mile Intelligence MattersEverybody is concerned about the bigger picture, but let's look at the micro picture. One delayed medication, one delayed therapy for MS or cancer, can trigger re-admission or treatment restart. Every undelivered refrigerated medication becomes silent data losses that go untracked, unreported, and unprevented.It may seem like one-off events that happen, but all of them contribute to a bigger operational failure that exists in healthcare and health tech. That’s why we need last-mile intelligence and last-mile care.When I think of it, I think of it as a concept of operational intelligence and care using the same AI frameworks that we already use: prediction, pattern recognition, automation, algorithms, but applying them also to movement, temperature, timing, and patient readiness. When a delivery is so clinical, logistics also become part of the care. And that’s what an actual end-to-end health tech system needs to build: a closed loop that healthcare needs to complete.What This Care Intelligence Would Look LikeLet’s imagine a very near-future architecture: that adjusts delivery based on a patient’s schedule and climate conditions. This helps patients know when their medications are coming and how they are going to be stored.AI-focused inventory forecasting that prevents waste and cold-chain failures, saving billions for both patients and providers.Transparent, context-driven notifications, not just tracking links, giving patients the right information and pharmacies the right instructions so that delivery happens smoothly.At its heart, all of this is still about building tech. It’s driven by integration between EHRs, pharmacies, and delivery data streams, all executed by real-time machine learning models analyzing delivery outcomes like excursions or patient acceptance times.This is what the real frontier can look like. It’s not just about building smarter AI; it’s about building connected artificial intelligence that unites the entire healthcare system.That’s what I’ve learned about this problem: how last-mile breakdowns affect patient health and safety, and how designing logistics with clinical-grade standards requires rethinking both software and how it behaves together. Healthcare doesn’t need another dashboard; it needs an  that patients never have to think about. The most advanced AI right now fails if the drug doesn’t arrive on time, and that’s something we have to change.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>World&apos;s oldest ruler is reelected at 92 years old #africa</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BGJTo0aDiZ4</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BGJTo0aDiZ4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cameroonian President Paul Biya was declared the winner of elections that were marred by allegations of irregularities.

With an average of  per district, staff and students rely heavily on laptops and classroom tech that must be protected from the latest threats. Today, these include anything from convincing “superintendent” emails to deepfake voice notes and student-account takeovers. is one example of a new kind of computer virus that uses generative tools to help write its own harmful code every time it runs. That means it can change slightly each time, making it harder for security systems to catch.Once it’s on a computer, the malware looks through the files. It can then steal them and lock them up so schools can’t open them.As ransomware becomes more sophisticated, attacks could target not just large schools but also individual students and staff members, leaving them open to higher risks of data theft, financial loss, and service disruptions. Schools must know where their blind spots are and how to protect themselves against these types of cyber attacks.Find and fix blind spots in built-in filtersBuilt-in tools often miss AI-powered lures, because the latest generative AI tools can write polished messages that sound human. In a recent survey of 18,000 employed adults,  that a phishing email was written by AI. For traditional security systems, it’s equally difficult. When there are no spelling errors or awkward phrases, filters that look for “typical scam language” struggle to flag them.Part of the problem is that AI can pull details from public websites or social media, and mention upcoming school events and staff names, making them sound authentic. Even when an email doesn’t contain malware, it can trick someone into sharing passwords or sensitive data. That means IT administrators must introduce filters that understand context.Once security teams realize an account has been compromised, they can flag the content and account as a warning to the rest of the school and update their security systems. But since AI can generate a slightly different version of the same phishing message for each target, it’s tricky to tell traditional security systems what patterns or “signatures” to look for. Tools that rely on rules and known threat lists, not real-time reasoning, no longer suffice.To tighten defenses, districts should audit their native filters quarterly. They must test defenses with realistic phishing simulations that represent today’s standard of attack, and adjust rules to flag messages containing urgency, payment requests, or login prompts. Advanced phishing detection tools and add-ons can help security teams flag messages that “feel off,” even if they look clean.Build a zero-trust defense planHackers are taking over staff and student accounts and sending phishing emails that impersonate school members. Microsoft reports that from  at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. Since many phishing emails now come from compromised legitimate accounts, built-in tools can no longer assume that messages from them are safe.Zero-trust policies, where schools trust no one automatically, are essential. Every login, device, and app connection should be verified. Schools must also monitor login patterns, device activity, and unusual sharing behavior in cloud apps like Google Drive or Microsoft 365. By building alerts for unusual internal activity, such as a teacher’s account suddenly sending dozens of messages after hours, IT admin teams can strengthen defenses.No single tool can catch everything, but together, they reduce the risk dramatically. Schools should enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on all accounts, monitor cloud activity for unusual file sharing, and track sign-ins from unfamiliar devices. That way, even if an attacker bypasses initial defenses, unusual account behaviors are quickly detected and contained.Since there are so many platforms to manage to keep school digital property safe, false positives can slow down the time to detection. Recent findings from 500 cybersecurity respondents found that  more than 90% of their cloud security alerts within 24 hours. When the fastest recorded attack was just  from initial engagement to compromise, security experts really have no time to waste.Schools can consider investing in mailbox intelligence that uses AI to help determine whether or not a message is impersonating a user. By building automated steps for quarantining suspicious messages, resetting credentials, and notifying affected users, schools can minimize the time between detection and containment.Train every user like a security partnerTechnology alone can’t stop every phishing attempt, especially as AI makes scams more convincing and personalized. Even the best-rated anti-phishing tools  in AV-Comparatives’ 2025 certification test. Firewalls, filters, and message quarantining are essential, but they can’t always catch messages that look legitimate or come from trusted accounts. That’s why it’s equally important to train staff and students how to recognize suspicious messages and feel confident reporting them.Effective training now looks nothing like the old “don’t click” slideshow. Districts in  and elsewhere are running monthly simulations, sending fake phishing messages to see who spots them and who needs coaching. This approach normalizes reporting and keeps awareness fresh.Training should also reflect each role’s risks. Staff who handle finances need to recognize fake invoices or urgent transfer requests. IT teams must know the signs of account takeover, MFA fatigue, and AI-generated help-desk impersonations. Students should learn to verify links and spot too-good-to-be-true offers.Short, recurring lessons work best. Replace annual seminars with quick micro-courses that teach people to pause, question, and verify. Track progress through reporting rates, not just attendance, and celebrate catches as a win for the whole district. A practical action plan going into 2026 must include: Frequent audits and adaptation: Run phishing simulations every semester and review which accounts or tools failed.Automate response management: Use AI-based mailbox intelligence to isolate suspicious messages and reset affected credentials.Teach critical thinking: Move from memorized rules to realistic phishing attack scenarios that train instinct and judgment.With education now overtaking healthcare as scammers’ top target, schools can’t afford shortcuts in cyber defense. The path forward combines smarter technology, disciplined verification, and a community that understands its role in security. When districts pair AI-powered detection with human skepticism, they shorten the gap between first click and first report—the window that decides whether a phishing attempt becomes tomorrow’s headline.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The True Guide to Omniscience And Why Everyone Lies to You About Knowledge</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-true-guide-to-omniscience-and-why-everyone-lies-to-you-about-knowledge?source=rss</link><author>Praise J.J.</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 04:57:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[They lied to you about knowledge.They told you it was accumulation. Stack enough facts, read enough books, attend enough lectures, and eventually you’d know things. They sold you the fantasy of the walking encyclopedia, the polymath as hoarder, someone whose head is a warehouse of dates and definitions and disconnected trivia.This is the ideology of the defeated. This is how they keep you weak.Knowing everything has nothing to do with remembering everything. It’s about seeing through everything—recognizing that reality is not chaos but compressed pattern, that every domain is just another dialect of the same underlying grammar. Once you learn to read that grammar, you don’t study fields. You dissolve them.This is not about becoming well-read. This is about becoming impossible to confuse.Reality is lazy. It reuses the same blueprints everywhere.Evolution in biology, iteration in startups, recursion in code, compound interest in finance, feedback loops in psychology—these aren’t separate phenomena. They’re the same engine wearing different masks. Once you see this, you stop learning subjects and start recognizing implementations.The skeleton is always there. Supply and demand. Feedback and equilibrium. Signal and noise. Compression and expansion. Every discipline is built on maybe thirty core patterns, and they repeat across domains like source code copied between projects. Physics borrows from geometry. Markets behave like ecosystems. Social dynamics mirror thermodynamics.Most people never notice because they’re trapped in the language each field uses to hide its bones. They think calculus and music theory are unrelated because one uses integrals and the other uses scales. They don’t see that both are describing rate of change, tension and release, the architecture of flow.You want to know everything? Stop respecting the boundaries between “subjects”. They’re artificial. They’re political. They exist to keep experts employed and amateurs intimidated.Learn the skeleton once. Then you can wear any flesh. To dissolve fields, you need a new method of perception.Step One: Pattern MasteryThe ability to see structure where others see noise.Every field has load-bearing concepts—the two or three ideas that generate everything else downstream. In physics, it’s conservation laws and least action. In economics, it’s incentives and information asymmetry. In persuasion, it’s status and narrative.Find these. Memorize nothing.The goal is not to know what happened in 1492 but to understand the pattern of imperial expansion so completely that you could predict what  happen when similar conditions emerge. The goal is not to remember the Krebs cycle but to understand energy transformation so deeply you can spot it in a business model, a political movement, a software architecture.You’re not collecting facts. You’re extracting algorithms.Here’s the test: can you explain the core of a field in three clear sentences to someone who knows nothing? If you can’t, you don’t understand it—you’re just parroting it. Clarity is compression. If your explanation needs jargon, you’re still borrowing someone else’s thinking.Strip it down. Find the generating function. Once you have it, you can reconstruct the entire domain from scratch. That’s not memorization. That’s mastery.And mastery is speed. When you see patterns instead of particulars, you don’t need to “figure things out.” You recognize them. Lightning-fast. Instant transfer.Knowledge is found with the quality of your questions.Most people ask diagnostic questions:  These are the questions of the cataloguer, the observer, the person who wants to describe reality but not command it.You need surgical questions. Questions that cut straight to causality, to constraint, to leverage. Questions that force a domain to reveal its skeleton whether it wants to or not.Ask: What has to be true for this to work? Ask: What’s the one variable that, if changed, collapses the entire system? Ask: What are they not saying? Ask: Whose incentive does this serve?These are questions of power. They don’t seek information; they seek control.Every bullshit idea, every fragile framework, every emperor with no clothes collapses under the right question. Most people accept conclusions. You interrogate foundations. You ask the question beneath the question. You don’t stop at the first answer—you keep pressing until the logic breaks or crystallizes into something unshakeable.This is how you become immune to propaganda, to hype, to intellectual fashion. You don’t fact-check—you structure-check. Does the logic hold? Are the assumptions sound? What evidence would falsify this?The world is full of ideas that exist only because no one asked them the right question. Be the person who asks.If something is foggy, it is either deliberately obscured or poorly explained. Both are failures.Step Three: Cross-Domain ConnectionThis is where you become dangerous.You’ve seen the patterns. You’ve sharpened your questions. Now you steal.Every breakthrough in history came from someone who took an idea from Domain A and jammed it into Domain B where it didn’t “belong.” Darwin stole from Malthus. The internet stole from packet-switching in logistics. Kanban stole from Toyota’s manufacturing line and gave it to software teams. Innovation is theft across borders.You want to know everything? Become a smuggler.Read biology, then apply it to markets. Study military strategy, then use it in negotiation. Learn from architects about constraint and form, then build arguments the same way.Study meteorology and understand how the weather affects the price of oil, then use it for your trading strategy. The insights are everywhere, waiting to be repurposed.This is the real differentiator. Anyone can learn their field. Few can import weapons from outside it. When you cross-pollinate, you see solutions invisible to the specialist. You have tools they’ve never encountered. You fight battles they don’t know exist.Most people stay in their lane because they think depth requires isolation. That’s scarcity thinking. Real depth comes from unexpected angles. The person who only studies startups will never build as well as the person who studies startups  evolutionary biology  game theory  Renaissance architecture.Range is not dilution. Range is multi-dimensional warfare.And the mechanism is simple: consume widely, connect obsessively. Don’t try to consume everything like overeducated people that will misinterpret this for memorizing a bunch of facts about onions and Caesar, and hope to find “connections”.Consume with direction in mind. When I opened up a chess book, I looked for the golden mean on predicting the future and closed it. If you were trying to find the cure for your dying friend’s disease, would you look for the ingredients and hints that matter or would you read fun facts about onions from start to finish, and hope it’ll miraculously be the cure?When you learn something new, don’t file it away. Immediately ask: Where else does this apply? What does this remind me of? How is this the same as that thing I learned last month from a totally different field?Your brain is not a library. It’s a network. The value is not in the nodes—it’s in the edges, the connections, the moments when two distant ideas collide and create a third thing no one’s seen before.Build those edges. Ruthlessly.When you do this long enough, something changes.You stop feeling lost. Not because you memorised everything in the traditional sense, but because you’ve seen the code beneath the surface. You walk into unfamiliar domains and recognize them as cousins of things you’ve already conquered.People start calling you smart. You got structurally aware. You built a mental physics engine, and now you can simulate outcomes before they happen. You predict, you adapt, you move faster than people who are still looking things up.You become impossible to confuse because confusion is just pattern mismatch, and you’ve trained yourself to find the pattern in anything. Chaos is no longer threatening. It’s just complexity you haven’t compressed yet.This is the real omniscience. Not memorizing all the answers, but being able to generate any answer you need, in real time, from first principles and transferred patterns. You don’t carry the weight of ten thousand facts. You carry the keys to ten thousand doors.Extract the pattern. Interrogate the premise. Connect the unexpected.Repeat it. Memorize nothing else.You’ll be able to  everything. Which is better. Which is faster. Which makes you untouchable.The world belongs to people who see clearly and move fast. It belongs to people who don’t need permission from experts because they’ve learned to think from the metal up. It belongs to people who treat knowledge not as a credential but as a weapon.They told you learning was about respecting what you don’t know.Learning is about supremacy. Cognitive. Relentless.

The trajectory of humanity has been altered, especially in the tech space.The advancement of AI in itself has received mixed reactions, some Reddit users see it as a  and others view it as a disruptor of their livelihood even where they lack immediate evidence. But according to the  there’s a significantly higher likelihood of job transformation than redundancy.Also, the , the consensus of research hints at a hybrid transformation of jobs rather than a Generative AI replacement. Still, tech workers may have reasons to be worried. Companies actually want to ship faster and replace workers with AI; the difficulties make the process currently unclear or a black box of future outcomes.Economic narratives determine reality and humans adapt accordingly. Capitalism organically came up with the term “dignity of labor” to justify the practice of working long hours for rewards with access to resources and participation in the economy’s engine of production and human consumption.This makes sense as long as there’s no disruption between the existing norm while preserving the possibility of change.  By this, capitalism built industries, businesses sprang up,  jobs were created as a result of the chaos, unions fought against unfair practices, and lawmakers devised regulations for nine-to-five workers and an ethos for the capitalist framework.Civilizations have been built on the scaffolds of existing frameworks. However, the question of computers automating our jobs still  against the collective. An understated part of the AI wave is, people may be less focused on mastery or professionalism; but on fear of the unknown. Cautious tech workers are worried about layoffs in their office spaces while undergraduates are still navigating their career choices amidst the uncertainty.According to a , generative AI is capable of boosting developer productivity. Yet, general data is still scarce on certainty due to the productivity paradox and AI limitations. For example, some expert coders have reported high productivity gains and have created agentic workflows and specification documents while some only use it for research purposes or restricted use cases while blaming the AI bugs, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.Nonetheless, there’s one thing workers are missing and business owners instinctively understand: the creation and cultivation of wealth is in the creation of value— employees or machines are a means to an end. This doesn’t make employees expendable, but it hints that the market operates on value and scarcity.Innovation and DisruptionThe first thing that came to mind after the  and other generative AI platforms, was the fear of writers getting automated away. But many understood it wasn’t just words that people read, it was the curation of thoughts by an informed human mind, or perhaps a playful one that mirrored imaginative possibilities. Large language Models are at best, mathematical ghosts of thoughts other humans have created with structural echoes.If there’s any hindsight problem, perhaps the economic landscape would have been framed differently if text-generators or image-generators were the names given to these products rather than Artificial Intelligence. Not because the name is wrong but because it had awoken humanity’s greatest fears against domination and hijacking by aliens of computers in old sci-fi movies.There’s also the perceptively thin line between a productivity booster and an automation/replacement of jobs. The  but a large part of it is similar with perhaps updated job postings with higher bars for employees because companies care more about their products and end goals rather than who does it — but they know humans understand it better even if they desire alternatives.There are numerous projections with the economy radically altered for good with a cumulatively higher U.S. GDP by 16% and $13 trillion by 2030, according to   And recently Nvidia has crossed the  for a company due to the AI boom. Higher market surplus creates more opportunities because business leaders reinvest gains in new platforms which often translates into opportunities for people.Where AI Utopia CollapsesFrom what we see, AI can only replace all jobs according to Elon Musk, if it fulfills five conditions:First, it can think like humans; but there’s no perfect statistical concrete formula for this. Second, all products or books or thoughts have been created; which isn’t realistic because of the infinitude of human thoughts and possibilities of realities. Third, if human problems and complexities never arise from a shift in stability. Fourth, if the whole race of humanity catches up to the new stasis without improvisation. Fifth, if all questions about the origin of humanity have been answered.Upon these five possibilities, the AI utopia hypothesis crumbles. There has never been any state in history where humans simply want to do nothing or not participate in their societies economically and socially. We would not live in a world organized by robots but perhaps a world where we organize robots.Workers should therefore view AI as a tool for augmented productivity if necessary in their workflow and understand that production of value is necessary to be relevant in the economy and get opportunities, the only problem is how fast the goalpost of value may change due to the breakneck pace of innovations and thinking in new frontiers of development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump, Xi Kick Off Pivotal Trade Talks | The China Show 10/30/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjbKHRnYMTY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XjbKHRnYMTY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 04:55:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Bloomberg: The China Show” is your definitive source for news and analysis on the world's second-biggest economy.

Holiday shopping trends in 2025 reflect several insights, including stress and uncertainty that have occurred throughout the year. The biggest holiday shopping trends for 2025 reveal that customers want to shop and celebrate weeks or even months earlier than the traditional holiday season.Not only has holiday shopping in 2025 started sooner, but it’s also going to be more focused on experiences and personal items. Consumers are also expected to continue their hybrid shopping pattern: researching online and making purchases in-store.As you prepare for holiday shopping 2025, look for opportunities to meet these consumer trends and drive success.Holiday shopping has already begun for many consumers. According to a recent holiday shopping survey,  began shopping for the holidays between August and October.Early shopping helps customers spread expenses over a longer time frame. This is particularly important for households facing financial pressure due to inflation and economic uncertainty stemming from government policies and tariffs.Additionally, 60% of surveyed customers claim that Black Friday is no longer relevant to their customer experience. They are seeking bargains and sales months sooner. Consider holiday branding for promotions that start earlier in the fall. Offer discounts and promotions now – don’t wait until late November.What gifts are customers buying in 2025?Holiday shopping statistics indicate that customers plan to spend roughly the same amount on holiday shopping this year, but they will be purchasing more essential goods and gift cards than discretionary items.Customers still want to buy and give gifts this year, but they are being far more thoughtful about what they are buying. Additionally, holiday shopping insights point toward three-quarters of consumers “” this holiday season by buying smaller quantities or delaying purchases. They might also opt for a less-expensive brand, even if it disrupts customer loyalty to their preferred company.As retailers prepare for the holidays, be intentional about promoting your staple items – the items that consumers both need and want. Customers are looking for more affordable items and bigger promotions, especially if the item is useful and still makes a thoughtful gift.Customers are more cautious during their holiday spending this season. One way to save on holiday shopping is to adopt a hybrid approach. They research items extensively online, examining online reviews and comparing prices, before heading to stores to purchase the items that offer the best deal and value.These e-commerce holiday trends can be an opportunity for retailers who have an online and brick-and-mortar presence. Customers are ready to buy offline, but they want to learn about items online. Retailers might consider promotions that encourage customers to shop online and then pick up in-store, especially if it helps families avoid shipping costs.The hybrid shopping approach reflects consumer sentiment in many areas, including rising shipping costs. Customers expect inflation and tariffs to impact prices and are looking to cut costs where possible.What do customers want this holiday season?Ultimately, customers are looking for joyful, or at least less stressful, holiday experiences during this season. Economic uncertainty has driven customers into more cautious spending on necessities rather than fun gifts, but they are still researching and making purchases.Customers are simply starting the process earlier and spreading their spending out across a longer stretch of time as they find opportunities to save money on great promotions far sooner than Black Friday.Customers are also seeking opportunities to experience the holiday spirit. This has led to a boost in holiday shopping and activities weeks or even months earlier than in previous years.Responsive retailers will look for opportunities to transform even routine shopping into a holiday experience this season. From store decorations, special holiday promotions, music, theming, and more – customers want to feel at least a bit of fun this season, and their spending will follow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What the Big Three Consultancies are Missing About AI (And the Code That Proves It)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-the-big-three-consultancies-are-missing-about-ai-and-the-code-that-proves-it?source=rss</link><author>GlobalHawk</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 04:52:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're in a boardroom today, you're likely hearing the same story from Deloitte, BCG, and McKinsey. A powerful consensus is forming among the world's top strategy advisors, and it sounds something like this:We face an  (Deloitte), a gap between what technology can do and what we can envision for it. We are entering an  (McKinsey), where autonomous AI systems will become the new operating model for business. And the ultimate competitor on the horizon could be the  (BCG), an organization with no human employees that operates with superhuman speed and adaptability.They are all correctly describing the destination. But they've left the map blank.They've given us the what and the why, but have largely ignored the operational how. Their solutions: "cultivate curiosity," "reimagine workflows," "foster a new mindset" are abstract ideals.This article offers a tangible, coded blueprint for the very systems these consultancies are theorizing about, based on a real experiment I ran. It's the engineer's answer to the strategist's question.The Consensus View from 30,000 FeetFirst, let's acknowledge the brilliance of the diagnosis. The Big Three have accurately identified the forces shaping the next decade of business. They argue the core challenge is a lack of "human capabilities" like curiosity, empathy, and divergent thinking to keep pace with technology. Their solution is for organizations to foster and cultivate these innate human skills.  They paint a picture of a new competitive landscape where AI-native firms have structural advantages in cost, speed, and adaptability. They advise incumbents to retreat to "human capabilities" like imagination and empathy as defensive moats. They outline a journey from simple "Agentic Labor" to a fully reimagined "Agentic Engine." They correctly state this requires new leadership roles and a fundamental rewiring of the business.The consensus is clear: the future is about architecting new ways of working and leveraging a new class of human skills. But how, specifically, do we build this future? Relying on traditional HR initiatives and cultural change programs feels like bringing a knife to a gunfight.The Engineer's Critique: What's Missing from the Strategy DeckThe strategy decks are missing the code. They lack the builder's perspective, which reveals that the very human capabilities they seek to cultivate can, in fact, be engineered.Critique 1: Abstract Ideals vs. Engineered Systems The consultancies talk about fostering curiosity and empathy. My experiment demonstrates that we can  these capabilities as functions within a system. We can synthesize capabilities, not just slowly cultivate them in humans.Critique 2: Unstructured Playgrounds vs. Scalable Engines  They recommend hackathons and safe spaces to foster imagination. This relies on luck. My experiment shows how to build a structured, repeatable   or assembly line for innovation that can be scaled, audited, and directed.Critique 3: Vague Leadership vs. The AI Orchestrator They talk about new mindsets for leaders. My work defines a concrete new : the , a systems architect whose primary skill is designing and deploying hybrid human-AI crews.The Demonstration: An R&D Department in a Python ScriptTo move from theory to practice, I built a working prototype of the very "Agentic Engine" McKinsey describes, tasked with solving the "imagination deficit" Deloitte identifies, in a way that mimics the speed of BCG's "AI-Only Firm."I assembled a team of specialized AI agents using CrewAI. The mission: design a novel therapy for Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, using only compounds derived from bee products.Here's the architectural blueprint:# main.py

The most critical part of the experiment was running it twice.Run #1: The Hinted StrategyI seeded the Genetic Translator's knowledge with a specific clue: that a compound in bee propolis (CAPE) is known to inhibit the . The crew seized on this and flawlessly built a cohesive, end-to-end plan around it, from modeling the STAT3 protein with AlphaFold to designing a Tokamak-inspired delivery system. It was a brilliant validation of a known hypothesis.Run #2: The Unsupervised StrategyI removed the hint. The crew was given the same mission but had to make the initial creative leap itself. The result was a completely different but equally viable plan. Without the STAT3 prompt, the crew reasoned that the  was another primary driver of Glioblastoma and independently found a connection to bee propolis. The rest of the team adapted instantly, designing a new plan around this new target.The Takeaways: An Engineered Blueprint for ImaginationThe fact that the crew produced two distinct, scientifically sound plans is the proof.These Aren't Parrots, They're Reasoning Engines: The crew demonstrated true informed agility. Given a specific starting point, it followed the logical path. Given an open-ended problem, it explored the possibility space and found another valid path. This is the engine of innovation.The Knowledge Base is the Steering Wheel: The experiment proves that the most critical element of orchestration is context. The RAG knowledge base is the primary tool for directing the AI's focus. A single sentence change altered the entire R&D trajectory, demonstrating a powerful and precise method for guiding discovery.The Pragmatist is Engineered Empathy: In both simulations, the Pragmatist was the MVP, asking the brutal questions about cost, safety, and patient burden. The consultancies are right that empathy is a crucial capability, but they're wrong that it can only be human. We can and must build agents whose core function is to represent the human perspective.From Strategy to ArchitectureThe consultancies have given us a diagnosis. They've told us we have an imagination deficit and need to become agentic. They've shown us the promised land.This experiment shows that the human capabilities they rightly praise can be synthesized and scaled as engineered functions within an AI crew. It shows that the reimagined workflows they call for can be designed as structured, repeatable discovery engines. And it defines the new leader of this era not as a mere manager, but as the  a systems architect who builds the teams that build the future.The most important question for a CEO is no longer just "What is our AI strategy?" It's "Who is architecting our AI crews?" The future won't be won by the firms that have the best strategy decks; it will be won by the firms that have the best-orchestrated intelligence.For reference here is the output from a run:Strategic Brief: EGFR-Targeted Glioblastoma Therapeutic Using Bee Byproducts and Smart Nanoparticle Delivery1. Summary of the Proposed Therapeutic The proposed therapeutic is an innovative, multi-modal strategy targeting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a central oncogenic driver in glioblastoma, utilizing bioactive small molecule inhibitors inspired by compounds found in bee byproducts such as propolis and bee venom. These inhibitors are rationally designed and optimized through advanced AI-driven molecular modeling and generative chemistry loops informed by AlphaFold high-resolution structural predictions of wild-type and mutant EGFR (notably EGFRvIII). Coupled with this molecular design is a sophisticated smart nanoparticle delivery system synthesized from natural bee-derived polymers, engineered for biocompatibility and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. This platform incorporates molecular sensors capable of detecting tumor microenvironmental cues, enabling a closed-loop, reinforcement learning (RL)-based control of therapeutic payload release. This adaptive system dynamically modulates drug delivery in response to tumor-specific biological signals, maximizing efficacy and minimizing unintended cytotoxicity or off-target effects. The approach thus integrates natural product bioactivity, cutting-edge protein structure elucidation, AI-guided drug discovery, and a Tokamak-inspired RL feedback control system for precise, responsive EGFR inhibition within the brain tumor microenvironment.2. Core Scientific Strategy Focus on EGFR, a widely validated molecular hallmark of glioblastoma malignancy and heterogeneity, with specific attention to oncogenic variants such as EGFRvIII that drive ligand-independent receptor activation.Structural Biology & AI Modeling: Employ AlphaFold's diffusion-based AI to generate complete and accurate 3D structures of mutant and wild-type EGFR, including dynamic conformations relevant for ligand binding and allosteric regulation. This structural knowledge facilitates identification of novel druggable pockets and optimizes binding interactions of natural bioactive inhibitors.AI-Driven Drug Discovery: Use a Hamiltonian Learning discovery loop combining a generative proposer agent and a composite scoring function utilizing AlphaFold-modeled EGFR conformations, molecular docking, and estimated binding energies to iteratively generate and select chemically viable, brain-penetrant small molecule EGFR inhibitors inspired by bee byproduct motifs. This accelerates lead identification geared to binding mutant EGFR with specificity and adequate pharmacokinetics.Smart Nanoparticle Delivery System: Develop nanoparticles from bee-derived polymers/lipids for safe BBB crossing, surface-functionalized with EGFR/ tumor-specific ligands to enhance tumor-cell targeting and receptor-mediated uptake; integrate embedded molecular sensors (pH, ROS, MMPs, mutant EGFR conformation markers) for real-time tumor microenvironment monitoring.Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning Control: Inspired by Tokamak plasma control, deploy an RL-based AI controller receiving continuous nanoparticle sensor inputs to precisely regulate controlled drug release rates via external stimuli (e.g., magnetic induction, ultrasound, or photoactivation). Reward shaping and curriculum learning enable adaptive, stable, and homeostatic maintenance of EGFR pathway suppression while minimizing normal tissue impact.Sequential Development Roadmap: Move from in vitro validations to preclinical in vivo studies and eventually towards clinical-grade, implantable or wearable RL control systems personalized to patient tumor microenvironment data, establishing a precision medicine pipeline.3. Primary Risks and Key Questions (Pragmatist’s Critique)Manufacturability and Scalability:The complex nanoparticle platform integrating natural bee-derived polymers with embedded sensors and surface ligands poses significant manufacturing challenges. Variability inherent to natural polymers may impair batch-to-batch consistency, stability, and reproducibility critical for clinical application.Sophisticated embedding of biosensors and robust, wireless intra-body communication systems for real-time feedback control increase technical complexity and cost, potentially limiting scalability and commercial viability beyond niche or specialized centers.Biological and Clinical Efficacy Risks:Glioblastoma’s intrinsic heterogeneity, dynamic evolution, and disrupted BBB create formidable barriers to uniformly delivering effective EGFR inhibition. The adaptive nanoparticle system must contend with variable tumor cell populations, infiltrative growth patterns, immune microenvironment modulation, and risk of off-target nanoparticle sequestration or clearance.Neurotoxicity and unintended immune or inflammatory responses due to nanoparticle accumulation or sensor/actuator components raise safety concerns, demanding rigorous characterization before clinical advancement.Patient Experience and System Practicality:Implementation will likely require implantation of external or internal AI control units, frequent interaction or calibration, and continuous monitoring, which may increase procedural invasiveness, patient burden, and healthcare resource demands.Risks of system malfunction or control algorithm errors must be mitigated by fail-safe mechanisms, but still create anxiety and complexity that could affect patient compliance and quality of life.Elevated costs and operational complexity compared to existing standards of care may hinder widespread adoption despite potential therapeutic gains.4. Recommendation for Immediate Next Step The priority immediate next step is to demonstrate proof-of-concept of the stimuli-responsive, sensor-integrated nanoparticle delivery platform’s payload release and EGFR inhibition kinetics in vitro using glioblastoma tumor mimetic models. This milestone should focus on:Validating that nanoparticles fabricated from bee-derived polymers can be reliably synthesized with consistent physicochemical properties and functionalized with targeting ligands.Demonstrating embedded molecular sensors can accurately detect relevant tumor microenvironmental cues (pH, ROS, mutant EGFR conformation markers) under controlled conditions.Establishing controlled, stimuli-triggered release of structurally optimized EGFR inhibitors (generated via the AI-driven pipeline) from these nanoparticles, with quantitative correlation to sensor input and drug release profiles.Confirming that released inhibitors effectively suppress EGFR phosphorylation and downstream oncogenic signaling in cultured glioblastoma cell lines expressing EGFRvIII or other relevant mutations.Testing safety parameters such as cytotoxicity toward non-tumor neural cells, nanoparticle stability, and degradation behavior in vitro.This controlled environment will provide critical data on manufacturability feasibility, sensor functionality, delivery efficacy, and safety signals before committing resources to complex in vivo and AI control system integration. Furthermore, successful in vitro validation will inform refinement of nanoparticle design, sensor integration, and RL control algorithm training curricula, de-risking subsequent preclinical development phases. Given the technology’s multidisciplinary complexity, a phased, data-driven approach focusing initially on establishing the core delivery and sensing platform’s functional viability offers the best pragmatic pathway to realize transformational glioblastoma therapy. This strategic brief synthesizes an ambitious, pioneering therapeutic paradigm for glioblastoma that leverages (1) targeted molecular design against EGFR informed by cutting-edge AI structural biology, (2) natural product-derived inhibitory compounds, and (3) a biologically intelligent nanoparticle delivery system orchestrated via reinforcement learning. While the high innovation potential is compelling for addressing glioblastoma resistance and heterogeneity, significant challenges remain in manufacturability, clinical translation feasibility, safety, and patient-centered deployment. Focused, stepwise validation beginning with in vitro demonstration of the core adaptive nanoparticle platform’s functionality and EGFR inhibitory effect stands as the most critical and realistic immediate next step toward eventual clinical impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UBS CEO on the First Brands fallout</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3ZaEBvtywbw</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3ZaEBvtywbw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 04:30:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“There is a little bit of witch hunting,”

[...] Now Gloo's executive chair and head of technology (who's largely free of the shareholder suit), Gelsinger has made it a core mission to soft-power advance the company's Christian principles in Silicon Valley, the halls of Congress and beyond, armed with a fundraised war chest of $110 million. His call to action is also a pitch for AI aligned with Christian values: tech products like those built by Gloo, many of which are built on top of existing large language models, but adjusted to reflect users' theological beliefs.
 
"My life mission has been [to] work on a piece of technology that would improve the quality of life of every human on the planet and hasten the coming of Christ's return," he said. Gloo says it serves "over 140,000 faith, ministry and non-profit leaders". Though its intended customers are not the same, Gloo's user base pales in comparison with those of AI industry titans: about 800 million active users rely on ChatGPT every week, not to mention Claude, Grok and others.
 
[...] Gelsinger wants faith to suffuse AI. He has also spearheaded Gloo's Flourishing AI initiative, which evaluates leading large language models' effects on human welfare across seven variables -- in essence gauging whether they are a force for good and for users' religious lives. It's a system adapted from a Harvard research initiative, the Human Flourishing Program. Models like Grok 3, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 earn high marks, 81 out of 100 on average, when it comes to helping users through financial questions, but underperform, about 35 out of 100, when it comes to "Faith," or the ability, according to Gloo's metrics, to successfully support users' spiritual growth. Gloo's initiative has yet to visibly attract Silicon Valley's attention. A Gloo spokesperson said the company is "starting to engage" with prominent AI companies. "I want Zuck to care," Gelsinger said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UK Woman Threatens Trademark Legal Action Against Cookbook Over ‘Sabzi’</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/29/uk-woman-threatens-trademark-legal-action-against-cookbook-over-sabzi/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 03:03:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s sort of funny in a way to see how ownership culture has specifically invaded the realm of the culinary arts. If ever there was a place for cultural fusion and an openness culture, it surely should be in cooking. And, yet, we have seen many instances of businesses and/or people attempting to trademark generic names for foods. Believe it or not, we had to have a decades long trademark dispute over “pretzel crisps“, for instance. Someone at one point attempted to trademark the term “breakfast burrito“. A couple in the UK did likewise with “Pho” before eventually surrendering that mark under public pressure.That last example is perhaps the best to lead into this current discussion, given the ethnic nature of the term and its use in the UK. Once more in the UK, this time it’s the owner of a deli that is threatening legal action on publisher Bloomsbury for releasing a cookbook with a title for which she has a trademark.Kate Attlee, the founder of Sabzi, says Bloomsbury has “refused requests” to change the name of one of their recently published cookery titles, which she claims has used her deli’s brand that is trademarked. Sabzi has also been publishing its recipes for free to its 5,000 newsletter subscribers and on its website and social media since 2023, and Ms Attlee had been planning to publish an eponymous book collating and building on this collection.However, in July Bloomsbury published a book of vegetarian recipe by author Yasmin Khan’s book under the name Sabzi – something that Ms Atlee claims is an “infringement of her intellectual property rights.”Now, perhaps you’re like me and wondering, at first blush, why in the world this is even a dispute. The problem is that “sabzi” isn’t some fanciful made-up brand name. The reason Khan’s book is titled  is because it’s a vegetarian cookbook with heavy Persian influences. Sabzi is a Persian word that translates roughly to “herbs” or “vegetables” depending on whom you ask. It’s also a term that is used to name all kinds of Persian dishes. Ghormeh Sabzi is an Iranian stew (and looks freaking amazing). Sabzi Bhaji is a vegetable curry dish (and also looks amazing). And this is a picture of Kuku Sabzi, an herbed fritatta.Looks good, right? Want to know where I got that from? It’s from Kate Attlee’s own website. She is threatening to sue or perform some other retaliatory action over a trademark she has that is the name of a food. This would be as if a restaurant in America got a trademark on “herb-encrusted” and sued other restaurants and/or cookbooks that referenced “herb-encrusted salmon” and the like.It’s nonsense. The outcome here should be exactly the same as with the “pho” example. This trademark should be undone one way or the other. It would be fantastic if Attlee realized this and voluntarily relinquished it herself.But in lieu of that, hopefully the courts can do it for her, should legal action actually come to be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Origins of Yoga</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/the-ancients/episodes/origins-of-yoga</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/the-ancients/e/68f8ba3eaf22931d80e68120/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=eJOxMddzAHpnc_5N4BjLGLfRPw-FT2IhDPwusUUYfM4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/">Podcast - Ancients</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Warrior, Cobra, Downward Dog.

Ok. We have IRC at example.fi
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of real-time text communication developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in 1988. Initially created to replace a local BBS system at the University of Oulu in Finland, IRC quickly gained global popularity, becoming a foundational technology for online chat communities and influencing the development of modern instant messaging and social media platforms. Its significance lies in its pioneering role in connecting people across the internet, fostering early online communities, and setting the stage for contemporary digital communication.

To commemorate this pivotal technology, example.fi provides a simple and limited IRC server. This server is uniquely written in AWK, a scripting language traditionally used for text processing, highlighting the adaptability and enduring legacy of IRC. This creative implementation serves as both an educational tool and a tribute to the foundational role of IRC in the evolution of online communication.

In the following picture you see Irssi in the background and Hexchat on top of it:
Note: if you plan to connect to example.fi, make sure you do not use any fancy features. In irssi, use -nocap option. In Windows, use for example hexchat.
As this is written in gawk, most IRC protocol features are not implemented. This includes, for example, channel and user listings, topics, the concept of "operator" etc.
Technical fun fact: Total code count is around 60 lines of awk and a few lines of bash.

The new law went into effect on Saturday. The regulation was introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) as part of its broader effort to curb misinformation online.
 
Under the new rules, influencers must prove their expertise through recognized degrees, certifications, or licenses before discussing regulated subjects. Major platforms such as Douyin (China's TikTok), Bilibili, and Weibo are now responsible for verifying influencer credentials and ensuring that content includes clear citations, disclaimers, and transparency about sources.

That's according to the public defender's office. Four of the dead were police officers. Backed by armored vehicles, helicopters and drones, thousands of heavily-armed police raided the strongholds of a major organized crime gang in some of Rio's poorest neighborhoods. Residents spent the night recovering the dead. The UN's human rights body says it is 'horrified' by the number of casualties and has called for an investigation.

It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to securely connect AI models with data sources while maintaining provider freedom. This gives organizations the ability to run AI-driven automation without relying on a single ecosystem. With a 16-year lifecycle, reproducible builds, instant rollback capabilities, and post-2038 readiness, SLES 16 also doubles down on long-term reliability and transparency.
 
For enterprises, this launch marks a clear step toward embedding intelligence at the infrastructure level. The system can now perform AI-assisted administration via Cockpit or the command line, potentially cutting downtime and operational costs. SUSE's timing might feel late given the AI boom, but its implementation appears deliberate -- balancing innovation with the stability enterprises demand. It's likely to pressure Red Hat and Canonical to follow suit, redefining what "AI-ready" means for Linux in corporate environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NPM flooded with malicious packages downloaded more than 86k times</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/npm-flooded-with-malicious-packages-downloaded-more-than-86000-times/</link><author>jnord</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:37:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>613.

Substrate's tool is the first step in the startup's ambitious plan to build a U.S.-based contract chip-manufacturing business that would compete with Taiwan's TSMC in making the most advanced AI chips, its CEO James Proud told Reuters in an interview. Proud wants to slash the cost of chipmaking by producing the tools needed much more cheaply than rivals. [...]
 
An engineering feat that has eluded even large companies, lithography needs extreme precision. ASML is the only company in the world that has been able to make at scale the complex tools that use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to produce patterns on silicon wafer at a high rate of throughput. Substrate said that it has developed a version of lithography that uses X-ray light and is capable of printing features at resolutions that are comparable to the most advanced chipmaking tools made by ASML that cost more than $400 million apiece. The company said it has conducted demonstrations at U.S. National Laboratories and at its facilities in San Francisco. The company provided high resolution images that demonstrate the Substrate tool's capabilities. "This is an opportunity for the U.S. to recapture this market with a homegrown company," Oak Ridge National Laboratory director Stephen Streiffer, an expert on high-energy x-ray beams, said in an interview. "It's a nationally important effort and they know what they're doing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Baltic states report 123,000 cases of GPS interference on flights and ships | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAo0-VcajT4</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XAo0-VcajT4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:00:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A barrage of aircraft navigation disruptions along the Baltic Sea has countries there scrambling to counter another form of what they're calling Hybrid Warfare.

A report cited by Swedish public television said that the first four months of this year saw around 123,000 incidents of GPS jamming and other disruptions affecting flights in the region.  

One of the disrupted flights was carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In August, she was on a tour of countries bordering Russia, Belarus and the Black Sea, when interference jammed the plane's GPS system.

Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.If you have a previous version of Rust installed via , you can get 1.91.0 with:If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel () or the nightly channel (). Please report any bugs you might come across!The Rust compiler supports a wide variety of targets, but
the Rust Team can't provide the same level of support for all of them. To
clearly mark how supported each target is, we use a tiering system:Tier 3 targets are technically supported by the compiler, but we don't check
whether their code build or passes the tests, and we don't provide any
prebuilt binaries as part of our releases.Tier 2 targets are guaranteed to build and we provide prebuilt binaries, but
we don't execute the test suite on those platforms: the produced binaries
might not work or might have bugs.Tier 1 targets provide the highest support guarantee, and we run the full
suite on those platforms for every change merged in the compiler. Prebuilt
binaries are also available.Rust 1.91.0 promotes the  target to Tier 1 support,
bringing our highest guarantees to users of 64-bit ARM systems running Windows.
Add lint against dangling raw pointers from local variablesWhile Rust's borrow checking prevents dangling references from being returned, it doesn't
track raw pointers. With this release, we are adding a warn-by-default lint on raw
pointers to local variables being returned from functions. For example, code like this:Note that the code above is not unsafe, as it itself doesn't perform any dangerous
operations. Only dereferencing the raw pointer after the function returns would be
unsafe. We expect future releases of Rust to add more functionality helping authors
to safely interact with raw pointers, and with unsafe code more generally.These previously stable APIs are now stable in const contexts:Many people came together to create Rust 1.91.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you.

For brevity, this release will be further referred to as OS/2 PPC. Following years of hype and high expectation, the release was very low key and in fact marked the end of development of OS/2 for PowerPC. The product was only available to a limited number of IBM customers and was never actively marketed. OS/2 PPC may not even had a box, although there were nice looking official CDs.OS/2 PPC only supported an extremely limited range of hardware—IBM Personal Power Series machines. Those were desktop models 830 and 850, and OS/2 PPC probably also supported the Power Series ThinkPads 820 and 850, though that can be only inferred from the fact that the graphics chipset employed by these ThinkPads was on the very short list of supported devices in OS/2 PPC.The IBM Power Series computers were IBM’s rather short lived foray into the PowerPC-based desktop personal computer market, circa 1995-1996. The PowerPC CPU aside, the systems were very similar to Intel based hardware of that era. They were designed around the PCI bus, but also included ISA expansion slots and on-board Crystal Audio ISA PnP chips. The desktop Power Series machines were IDE based, ThinkPads used SCSI disks. The computers had standard serial and parallel ports, as well as most of typical PC hardware such as interrupt and DMA controllers. The desktops had onboard S3 864 video, ThinkPads used Western Digital flat panel chipsets. Several optional graphics cards were supported, notably Weitek P9100 based accelerators. The desktops also had onboard Ethernet chips (AMD PCnet).The Power Series systems were closely related to certain IBM RS/6000 workstations. The RS/6000 Model 43P-7248 was nearly identical to the Power Series 850. They used the same motherboard, only the RS/6000 had on-board SCSI controller. Unlike the RS/6000 systems intended for the workstation market and running almost exclusively IBM’s AIX operating system, the Power Series systems were designed for “regular” personal computer users. The machines were supposed to run OS/2, Windows NT, AIX, or Solaris. OS/2 PPC was only semi-finished, and the Solaris for PowerPC port (version 2.5.1) was similarly short-lived. Microsoft dropped PowerPC support in 1996, not long after the Windows NT 4.0 release. Most of the Power Series systems ended up running AIX, which supported them until version 5.1. Linux also supported the Power Series to some extent. Windows NT was clearly the closest competitor of OS/2 PPC.For this article, OS/2 PPC was installed on a Power Series 830, installed by its previous owner in a RS/6000 43P case. The CPU was a 100MHz PowerPC 604 with 256KB L2 cache, and the machine was equipped with 192MB RAM, which was the maximum it could handle. The graphics was an on-board PCI S3 Vision 864 with 2MB video memory and true color S3 SDAC. The machine was equipped with 2.1GB IDE hard drive—AIX can handle up to 8GB and Linux can utilize even larger disks, but OS/2 and NT were not happy with anything over about 2.5GB. The 830 was originally sold with either 500MB or 1GB disks and 16MB RAM. The Power Series 850 systems were equipped with 100 or 120MHz CPUs, slightly more RAM and larger disks.OS/2 Warp, PowerPC edition was delivered on two CDs. The first CD contained the operating system and BonusPak, the second CD was an application sampler with several demo applications.Installation was surprisingly easy and painless. The CD was bootable and there were almost no choices to make during installation—only the disk partitioning was user selectable. The PowerPC operating systems (OS/2, NT, AIX and Linux) generally did not coexist as there was no real equivalent of a boot manager and each OS wanted to install its own boot loader. The OS/2 installer re-partitioned the disk and overwrote any other operating systems. The boot partition had to be FAT. It was possible to create HPFS data partitions, but the HPFS support appeared to be somewhat unstable and likely a last-minute addition.After the OS was copied from the installation CD-ROM and the system booted from fixed disk for the first time, the user was greeted by the following screen:Indeed, OS/2 PPC really looked just like OS/2 Warp, at least at first glance. The system booted up in 640×480 mode with 256 colors, using the accelerated S3 driver. The desktop right after installation looked like this:Still very much like OS/2 Warp, except for that little Systems Management folder. This feature was not present in the Intel OS/2 Warp release, although it was added later. After installing the BonusPak and a few other additions and changing the resolution, the desktop still looked like plain OS/2 Warp, with the exception of the background bitmap of course (click on the picture to see full size screenshot):The system was now running in 1024×768 resolution, but still with 256 colors. The graphics chip supports 64K colors at this resolution, unfortunately the software used to take screenshots (a demo version of Impos/2) was unable to take any screenshots at this resolution. 256 colors it is then, and time to more closely examine the operating system. The README file is a good starting point, and it was quite long in OS/2 PPC. It consisted largely of a list of unimplemented or incomplete features.For example, notice the word “Connect” in the screenshot. OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition, doesn’t have any connectivity to speak of. Networking support, in a nutshell, didn’t exist. No LAN Server client, no TCP/IP, nothing. There was just HyperAccess Lite and CompuServe Information Manager, which worked (in theory at least) over a modem. The product name itself seems to have been a last minute change. Programs and documentation in many instances refer to OS/2 Warp Connect, PowerPC Edition, but the final product was called just OS/2 Warp and not “Connect”. One of the README files explains the name change and alludes to networking support in “future versions”.For development versions of OS/2 PPC there was TFTP support which talked directly to the microkernel Ethernet or Token Ring driver and entirely bypassed OS/2. This transport layer also supported remote debugging. This is in sharp contrast to Windows NT which fully supported networking (TCP/IP and SMB file sharing) on the same hardware. Networking was obviously planned for OS/2, but the project was killed before this part was done.Not everything was so blatantly unfinished though. The DOS support in OS/2 PPC was a pleasant surprise:On a closer look, it’s clear that OS/2 PPC included a full-fledged PC emulator, which supplied a virtual x86 CPU as well as common PC hardware. Interestingly, the DOS support in OS/2 PPC was based on PC-DOS 7 and not the outdated DOS 5 level code that OS/2 on Intel was stuck with. The OS/2 PPC DOS boxes thus had for instance the DOS E editor (very similar to TEDIT) or REXX support. Why IBM never updated the DOS support on the Intel side is a mystery. OS/2 PPC supported both windowed and full screen DOS sessions. The full screen sessions always ran in graphics mode, even when the emulated DOS application was using text mode.Not satisfied with “just” DOS emulation, IBM also supported Win-OS/2, both full-screen and windowed:It is difficult to judge how stable the DOS and Win-OS/2 emulation really was, but whatever little utilities came with the OS/2 system seemed to work well, including wave audio in Win-OS/2, and the performance was surprisingly good. IBM must have spent a lot of effort on the x86 emulation support. Documentation hinted at a possibility of future support for native OS/2 x86 applications via emulation.IBM also obviously spent a lot of time on the multimedia support in OS/2 PPC. The multimedia support worked unexpectedly well, especially when contrasted with the problems common on Intel machines.The system played video and audio without problems, with MIDI support either via a software synthesizer or an OPL3 compatible chip (the software synthesizer sounded far better). The application sampler CD came with several videos, mostly ads for OS/2. The PowerPC Toolkit also came with a beta version of OpenGL support, which shared code with IBM’s AIX workstation grade implementation.OS/2 PPC was a hybrid halfway between Warp 3 and Warp 4. The user interface looked like Warp 3, but many of the features of OS/2 PPC later showed in Warp 4 on Intel. One of them was the not very popular Feature Installer:The Feature Installer was used to install the BonusPak, several tools and games, and curiously enough, also the Command Reference which for some odd reason wasn’t part of the base install. Here’s one of those games:Again, there is no real difference from the Intel version, except for the about box text (notice the “Connect” text). And finally the IBM Works text editor—again there is no discernible difference from the Intel version:OS/2 for PowerPCs System OverviewOS/2 PPC was a strange OS. In many ways it was exactly identical to the Intel version, yet in other ways it was completely different. The user interface was the same and the entire API practically unchanged. Among the differences were the addition of full Unicode support and 32-bit console API (Kbd/Mou/Vio). The largely unchanged API was the reason why it was relatively easy to port existing OS/2 software to PowerPC. The biggest difference was not even the CPU but rather the compiler—IBM used the MetaWare High C/C++ for PowerPC development (it was allegedly cheaper for the IBM OS/2 division to contract MetaWare rather than IBM’s own compiler group). The MetaWare tool set was only used as a cross compiler hosted on x86 OS/2 systems. IBM used MetaWare’s compiler for embedded PowerPC development in general (IBM’s involvement with MetaWare goes at least as far back as AIX for PS/2), and MetaWare also marketed an OS/2 x86 product. Watcom was at the time working on PowerPC version of their compiler, but OS/2 PPC was killed before that project was finished. The last IBM Developer’s Connection release which contained OS/2 PPC material also included a beta version of IBM’s VisualAge C++ compiler. No release of a compiler (or a debugger) running natively on OS/2 PPC is known.The OS/2 PPC development tools were quite different from their Intel counterparts. To begin with, instead of the LX executable format, OS/2 PPC used the industry standard ELF. Several tools were completely unchanged (IPFC for instance), many were entirely new (linker, librarian, resource compiler). The ABI (Application Binary Interface) used in OS/2 PPC was based on the UNIX SVR4 PowerPC ABI. One notable difference was that OS/2 of course ran in little endian mode, unlike PowerPC UNIX ports but just like Windows NT.Delving deeper into the kernel, OS/2 PPC had precious little in common with the Intel version. The product was based on the IBM microkernel, which was a refinement of the Carnegie Mellon University Mach microkernel. The microkernel bore no resemblance to the Intel OS/2 kernel whatsoever and it was also very different from most other operating systems of the time (NeXTSTEP was also based on the Mach microkernel).The initial grandiose plan was to build the Workplace OS, the One Ring to Bind Them All of operating systems. Workplace OS (or WPOS for short) was supposed to be built on top of the Mach microkernel and support multiple “personalities”. The personalities would implement existing operating systems such as OS/2, AIX, Windows NT and perhaps even Mac OS. In the end this never happened and the only supported personality was OS/2. This was somewhat similar to Windows NT where the the non-Windows personalities (environment subsystems) eventually withered away.The initial plan was still tangible in OS/2 PPC. The OS/2 personality was implemented in the “OS/2 Server” and there were certain “personality neutral” services. Most device drivers were personality neutral and worked directly with the microkernel. This included disk and network drivers. A notable exception were the display drivers, where OS/2 PPC introduced the GRADD model (later ported to Intel OS/2). Documentation on OS/2 PPC internals is somewhat sparse and the online books shipped with PowerPC Toolkit were in many cases either incomplete or simply unmodified copies of OS/2 for Intel documentation. A good source of information is the Redbook titled “OS/2 Warp (Power PC Edition) – A First Look” published by IBM International Technical Support Organization in December 1995, document number SG24-4630-00 for those interested.OS/2 for PowerPC ImpressionsWhat was OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition like? An unfinished product, rough around the edges but simultaneously technically very interesting and advanced and showing promise. Even though the OS/2 PPC release wasn’t called a beta, it was obvious that this was a beta level product (if even that in some respects). Many features were unfinished or completely missing, notably networking. The kernel code didn’t look much like a production build and printed out quite a lot of debugging output on a serial console, if one was attached. The HPFS support was very unstable, and the stability of Win-OS/2 left a lot to be desired. There were too many clearly unfinished parts of the product—documentation, missing utilities, etc.On the other hand a large portion of the system worked well. The user interface and graphics subsystem in general didn’t exhibit any anomalies. Multitasking was reliable and all things considered, responsiveness quite good for a 100MHz CPU and code that was not likely to have been performance tuned. The multimedia subsystem worked much better than expected. Many things were much improved compared to Intel OS/2—internationalization, graphics subsystem, updated console API, and so on. The system seemed to have enough raw power, even if it wasn’t harnessed too well. Boot time was rather long but once up and running, the system was snappy (with some exceptions, notably the CD-ROM driver). To reach true production quality, the OS would have needed at least additional six months of development, perhaps more.How useful was OS/2 PPC? Not very. In fact, it was almost completely useless. It only ran on three or four models of rather rare IBM machines and supported almost no additional devices. The OS was clearly unfinished and not entirely stable. Worst of all, there were about zero applications. Because OS/2 PPC was never truly in use, PowerPC versions of OS/2 applications were never sold, although several OS/2 ISVs ported their applications to OS/2 PPC as evidenced by the application sampler. Porting wasn’t very difficult and tools for building PowerPC applications were available, but since there was no demand for them, there was little point in porting.OS/2 for PowerPC was undoubtedly an interesting experiment, albeit a failed one. It is impossible to tell whether this failure was caused more by shortcomings of OS/2 for PowerPC or the failure—perhaps just falling far short of expectations—of the PowerPC platform as a whole.Without the generosity of Mike Kaply and Chris Graham, this article could not be written.Some of the above information was derived from IBM documentation and Redbooks, which may have been inaccurate due to the evolving nature of the OS/2 PPC project.

Now, more and more subtitles on Crunchyroll are looking like this:In these new subtitles, translations for dialogue and on-screen text aren’t even separated to different sides of the screen – everything is just bunched up together at either the top or the bottom with only capitalization to distinguish what’s what, leading to poor readability. In addition, lots of on-screen text is just left straight up untranslated. For comparison, here’s what subtitles on Crunchyroll looked like just a season prior in Summer 2025:Here, stylized and positioned text is used to effectively present translations for multiple instances of on-screen text even with dialogue going on at the same time. It’s very obvious how each bit of translation connects with the original footage! Given this level of presentation quality with previous subtitles, it should be clear that new subtitles for Fall 2025 shows shouldn’t look as bad as they do.Third-party subtitles with zero oversight – what could possibly go wrong? Screenshot from The Yuzuki Family’s Four Sons (Fall 2023, Crunchyroll)Now, subtitles with poor presentation quality aren’t entirely new to Crunchyroll. Some titles on the service have always had third-party subtitles—that is, subtitles provided by the licensor—that Crunchyroll just puts up with zero oversight. This in itself has caused numerousissues over the years, but the pressing issue today is how low quality presentation reminiscent of third-party subtitles can now be found even in first-party subtitles, by Crunchyroll’s own subtitling staff.And that’s “destroying subtitles”?It sure is when it’s anime we’re talking about! Anime as a medium has made prominent use of on-screen text basically since its inception. The amount of it varies from series to series, but almost every anime out there makes use of on-screen text at one point or another, with some featuring downright ridiculous amounts of  (what on-screen text is called for short). With all this on-screen text, it is very common for there to be text visible on the screen potentially in multiple positions, even when characters are speaking.As such, if you are in the business of localizing anime for non-Japanese audiences, you need to be able to deal with on-screen text. At bare minimum, when subtitling anime, you should be able to do  (multiple lines of text on the screen at the same time) and  (the ability to freely place subtitles anywhere on the screen). Anything less and you are likely to run into trouble the moment you get to something as simple as a next episode preview:Multiple instances of on-screen text are running in parallel with dialogue. Screenshot from  (Winter 2014, Underwater-FFF fansubs)Overlaps and positioning are really just the bare necessities for dealing with on-screen text in anime though – ideally, you should also be able to use different fonts, colors, animate text in various ways, etc. Making use of all these possibilities is an art unto itself, and this art of on-screen text localization is commonly referred to as typesetting. Typesetting is important even when dubbing anime, as all that on-screen text is going to be there in the video all the same!So why would Crunchyroll get rid of typesetting?That is a good question. It is no exaggeration to say that up to this point, Crunchyroll with its typesetting was the unambiguous market leader when it came to presentation quality for official anime subtitles… though for the most part, other services dealing in anime have never even bothered to try. Sentai Filmworks’ Hidive is just about the only other anime service that even attempts to do typesetting, though they license so few shows per season that they are a tiny player compared to the Big Boys of anime streaming.And it is very likely the existence of these Big Boys that has played a key part in Crunchyroll’s eradication of its typesetting. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video probably need no introduction to anyone reading this – both are very popular general streaming services. Despite anime being only a minor part of their catalogs, a large chunk of today’s anime watching worldwide happens through said services thanks to their sheer user counts alone.Crunchyroll clearly seems to know this, which is why it has been sublicensing its anime properties to both Amazon and Netflix for multiple years at this point. But with such sublicensing comes the matter of dealing with the subtitling standards of general streaming services. I’m not going to mince words: these standards are  at least as far as anime is concerned. Netflix for example insists that you stick to at most two lines of text on screen at once, which makes sense most of the time… if you’re talking about dialogue alone. Unfortunately, it becomes completely inadequate when dealing with anime’s plentiful on-screen text. Moreover, the standards of these services actively refuse to give you tools like positioning and overlaps, even though the TTML subtitle format they use supports said features!With such typesetting-hostile standards to deal with, Crunchyroll had basically two choices for how to make sublicensing to Amazon and Netflix work with their existing subtitles that feature actual typesetting: Either 1) try to negotiate with the services for permission to make use of more TTML capabilities (that the subtitle renderers of said services should already support!) or 2) start mangling subtitles with typesetting into something compatible with the awful subtitling standards of the general streaming services. I am not aware if Crunchyroll ever attempted the former, but I can confirm that it eventually started doing the latter.Editors among Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff were  to convert finished high quality subtitles with typesetting into limited low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting, compatible with Amazon & Netflix subtitling standards. They got paid extra for the manual effort required by the process.Overlapping on-screen text and dialogue makes for a miserable anime watching experience with limited TTML subtitles. Video clip from  (Winter 2018, Netflix)Unfortunately, after a couple years of this kind of manual conversion work, the Crunchyroll leadership seems to have decided that it isn’t enough, and that Crunchyroll must do away with high quality subtitles with typesetting entirely and only produce low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting from now on. But if they already had a working process for high quality subtitles at home and low quality TTML subtitles elsewhere, why would they just decide to give that up in order to produce exclusively low quality subtitles? It doesn’t seem to make very much sense, even as a cost-cutting measure. There should be so much value in being able to advertise best viewed on Crunchyroll to potential audiences for long-term growth, right?To understand  we need to look into some relevant history. Specifically, what happened after Sony bought Crunchyroll and merged it with Funimation, another US anime distributor that Sony had bought previously. But in order to also understand  first we need to look at what both Crunchyroll and Funimation were like before this fateful merger happened, as well as how they approached anime subtitling over the years.A short history of Crunchyroll and its subtitling standardsCrunchyroll launched in 2006 as a pirate streaming site focused on East Asian media content, featuring fansubbed anime, live action drama, music videos, and so on. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the site back then – as a rule of thumb, pirate streaming sites are always worse quality-wise than if you just directly downloaded the pirated releases they use as a base, and the sites mostly exist to make their admins illicit money through ads, begging for donations, and other shady crap. It is important to note though that legal anime streaming basically wasn’t a thing at this time.Crunchyroll in 2007. The “help out” message at the top is asking for donations.However, it was likely this exact venture capital funding that enabled Crunchyroll to negotiate a major deal with the Japanese broadcasting company TV Tokyo, which was announced at the start of 2009. This announcement brought with it the news that Crunchyroll was going full-time legitimate and getting rid of all its pirate content. With this move, Crunchyroll found itself in a position of having to start producing subtitles of its own (instead of just uploading fansubs) and somehow present said subtitles to its customers.Aegisub is an advanced subtitling software built by fansubbers, for fansubbers.For the subtitle production part, Crunchyroll managed to strike a deal with a bunch of fansubbers to take on the job. This single decision was a fateful one, as it was the foundation for basically everything that came after – with former fansubbers on the job, the tools of the trade were set according to the standards of fansubbers: the subtitling software of choice was to be Aegisub, and the subtitle format of choice was to be Aegisub’s native format, Advanced SubStation Alpha, or ASS for short.ASS is an extremely powerful format in terms of formatting and styling capabilities, and with Aegisub, it is easy to produce ASS subtitles that make use of said capabilities. However, as a streaming site, Crunchyroll needed to be able to present these ASS subtitles in the browser somehow, and the only full-fledged ASS renderers that existed were only available in the traditional local media playback environments targeted by fansubbers, which meant that Crunchyroll couldn’t make use of said renderers on the web directly.Now, there are two main ways to subtitle videos, with opposing pros and cons: – the subtitles are burned into the video itself.  as you only need to be able to play video, but inflexible for updates and multiple languages as you have to recreate your video files over and over again with expensive processing called . – the subtitles exist as their own separate media track that the video player renders on top of the video in realtime during playback, making softsubs complex to playback, but updates and multiple tracks are very cheap as you only need to deal with tiny subtitle files while the video files remain unchanged.As such, one way Crunchyroll could have solved the subtitle presentation problem would have been to simply hardsub its ASS subtitles, but despite the challenges it posed, Crunchyroll decided to go with softsubbing instead (which was also the fansub standard at the time). And so Crunchyroll set out to build its own ASS renderer in Flash, the primary technology used to play video on the web at the time. Here’s a screenshot of some of the first subtitles ever officially authored by the fully legitimate Crunchyroll, rendered in the current ASS renderer but adhering to the limits of the company’s very first Flash subtitle renderer:Screenshot from  (Spring 2009, Crunchyroll)As can be seen, even the very first version was already capable of handling both overlaps and positioning. Now, the positioning was limited to the eight edges and the center of the screen, making for just nine possible positions total, but even that was enough to handle the humble next episode preview at the very least. Beyond these, the first version also supported fading animations. It wasn’t much, but it did cover the bare minimum for dealing with on-screen text in anime.Over the years, Crunchyroll managed to slowly improve its Flash subtitle renderer to enable the use of more ASS features. Custom colors, multiple fonts, multiple styles, rotation, and full positioning were implemented (albeit in somewhat hacky and unwieldy fashion). This went on until 2018, when Crunchyroll was faced with a major issue: Flash was seeing rapid decline in use, and web streaming was shifting over to HTML5-based technology. However, with a custom ASS renderer built in Flash, Crunchyroll couldn’t easily make the change, as it would mean having to essentially rebuild the custom subtitle renderer they had from scratch in HTML5 (as much like in the Flash days, there still were no solutions native to the web available for rendering ASS subtitles).However, Crunchyroll managed to come up with a way to solve the problem of moving from Flash to HTML5 with the help of another new web technology called WebAssembly, which allowed developers to take code that wasn’t developed for the web and compile it for use on the web. With WebAssembly, Crunchyroll could take libass, one of the few fully-featured ASS renderers out there, and use it for their new HTML5 player. Now, not only did all their old ASS subtitles render nicely in HTML5, but the possibilities for typesetting at Crunchyroll had taken a huge leap forward. And the subtitling staff at Crunchyroll was more than happy to make use of this newfound power.You couldn’t see typesetting like this on Crunchyroll back in the days of Flash. Video clip from  (Fall 2022, Crunchyroll)That said, despite having a technically fully-featured ASS renderer to work with, there were still limitations. Code compiled with WebAssembly runs worse compared to its original native counterpart, which limits how heavy the typesetting can be (with the flexible features of ASS, it is very easy to produce typesetting that simply cannot be rendered in realtime even on powerful computers, resulting in notable lag during playback). A commercial service like Crunchyroll will also generally want to keep its content watchable even on lower-end devices, which further reduces how complex any typesetting can be.And this is the limited but functional standard of typesetting that Crunchyroll users got to enjoy (with first-party subtitles) up until the fateful season of Fall 2025 that prompted the creation of this article.Before we move to the conclusions for this section, though, it is worth noting that while Crunchyroll currently uses softsubbed ASS subtitles whenever it can, there are platforms and devices (like various TVs) where this kind of ASS rendering simply isn’t possible to do. Crunchyroll is available on some platforms like this, which means it has been making additional hardsubbed versions of everything on top of the usual softsubbed ones.So, what can we learn from all this? At least one thing is abundantly clear: for most of its existence, the leadership at Crunchyroll had at least some respect and understanding for anime as a medium. They understood that it was important to be able to deal with on-screen text in their subtitles, and allocated enough resources to make typesetting possible. The company even managed to improve in this regard over time, albeit very slowly.That said, anyone familiar with anime fansubs of the 2010s and 2020s probably can’t help but feel disappointed that even the highest effort typesetting from Crunchyroll could only ever be on the level of fansub releases from around 2010 at best. Why 2010 specifically? Because from 2011 onwards, fansubbers started widely incorporating advanced motion tracking into their typesetting. Observe an example of such fansub typesetting from over a decade ago, the likes of which has never been seen on Crunchyroll:Video clip from  (Fall 2013, Underwater fansubs)Now, while fansubbers giving away their work for free might get away with saying just get a better computer to anyone whose devices can’t render softsubbed typesetting like this in realtime, an official service that lots of people pay for doesn’t really have the same luxury, which is the main reason why you don’t see stuff like this softsubbed on Crunchyroll. But this is not an insurmountable problem, so make no mistake: official anime services could absolutely offer typesetting with similar level of quality to the best of fansubs. The basic solution to the performance problem is very simple, even: you simply hardsub the typesetting. This would work from streaming to physical disc releases and only the sky would be the limit in terms of the typesetting quality you could offer, as realtime rendering would no longer be a concern!Now, as mentioned earlier, hardsubbing does make things more complicated and expensive on the backend as you need to encode and store multiple copies of video. Crunchyroll is already dealing with this, though! But if costs are an issue, the system is pretty easy to improve in theory: if you keep the dialogue softsubbed, only the parts of the video that actually feature typesetting would be hardsubbed, and with some clever engineering and an understanding of how modern media formats work, you would only have to keep multiple copies of the typeset parts. And since the average anime episode has on-screen text only for a small percentage of its total runtime, combining softsubbed dialogue and hardsubbed typesetting like this would make for a highly cost-effective setup.Typesetting like this would be possible to do even for official anime services. Video clip from  (Fall 2021, Chasa fansubs)And since with a mixed system like this you would only have softsubs for the technically simpler dialogue, you could even convert these dialogue-only ASS subtitles to a simpler but more widely supported subtitle format for playback, which theoretically should do away with the need to keep fully hardsubbed copies around entirely, without any real loss in quality! I actually built a minimal version of a mixed system like this myself when I was doing some anime streaming work a few years back and can confidently say that this would be extremely doable for any official anime service… as long as they just cared enough.Keep this example of fansub typesetting in mind for later. Video clip from Danganronpa: The Animation (Summer 2013, UTW fansubs)Unfortunately, any interest Crunchyroll had for improving their subtitle rendering for typesetting seemed to run out after the 2018 transition to WebAssembly libass. Not that it actually ever seemed to be all that high to begin with, though, as evident by some of the low-hanging fruit that Crunchyroll never bothered to pick in this regard; the most obvious of which would be Crunchyroll’s dogged insistence to restrict typesetting font choices to Core Fonts for the Web. Free for commercial use fonts have been plentily available since the Flash days, and custom fonts have been well supported on the web for a similarly long time.Anyway, it would have never been all that hard for Crunchyroll to support custom fonts for typesetting, especially after the 2018 move to HTML5. The underlying technology was there and font files are tiny in size compared to the video files being streamed – this would have been an extremely simple and effective improvement for all typesetting efforts. Yet Crunchyroll never reached for this improvement, which is why  has kept appearing in Crunchyroll typesetting with depressing regularity.There it is again.  Screenshot from  (Summer 2023, Crunchyroll)It is also disappointing how regularly the anime staples of opening & ending songs are still left untranslated on Crunchyroll, though this issue is admittedly much harder to solve than you’d expect. Still, it is possible to do so, especially with Sony’s resources behind the company today. That goes double when Sony is involved in anime production in any way, as then the songs being used should be well-known to all relevant parties well in advance of airing for timely rights-clearing. So if Crunchyroll/Sony is in any way involved with an anime’s production, it should basically always be possible for songs to be translated the moment the first episode is released.But that’s enough about Crunchyroll’s history. Now it’s time to look at the other company mentioned earlier and see how they’ve fared in comparison…A short history of Funimation and its subtitling standardsIn the early 90s, Japanese-American businessman Gen Fukunaga was approached by his uncle who was working as a producer for Toei. A proposal was made: if Fukunaga could start an anime company in US, Toei would license the rights to the Dragon Ball franchise to it – a franchise that was already making mad cash in Japan. Sensing an opportunity, Fukunaga found investors, and thus in 1994 Funimation was born. A year later, Dragon Ball was on US TV, dubbed and edited to “conform to American sensibilities and tastes”.It was especially  (1989-1996) that hit it big in the US.In the early 2000s, fueled by Dragon Ball’s success, Funimation started expanding its business by getting home video distribution rights for 4Kids Entertainment licenses and non-Japanese kids’ cartoons, the latter eventually expanding into getting involved in production too. But beyond increased investment in kids’ cartoons, Funimation also started experimenting with more anime licenses of its own, the 2001 anime adaption for Fruits Basket being one of its early standout releases.Out of these various expansion attempts, “more anime” seemed to be the one to work out best, and towards the end of the 00s that became the main direction of Funimation’s business. This move was helped along by a bunch of licenses obtained from now-defunct US anime publishers Geneon USA and ADV. And in the spring of 2009, hot on the heels of Crunchyroll going legit, Funimation announced that they too were getting into the anime streaming business. The resulting anime streams from Funimation were hardsubbed and looked like this:What you see here is exactly what you got: plain text at top center or bottom center, with dialogue on bottom, and translations for all on-screen text piled up top. So while overlaps were technically supported, full positioning did not seem to be possible, which made things quite awkward the moment there was more than one sign visible on the screen at the same time. This was also the standard you could expect from Funimation’s DVD and Blu-ray releases. And beyond the way too common dialogue three-liners (which are generally terrible for readability), sometimes you even saw :Screenshot from  (Winter 2014, Funimation)The subtitling software that Funimation was using at the time was Telestream MacCaption. In terms of usability and general authoring features, it was no match for Aegisub, although it was actually capable of doing some overlaps, positioning, and styling – Funimation just never chose to make use of these capabilities for its anime subtitles.TeleStream stopped supporting MacCaption in 2023.This remained the Funimation subtitle standard all the way until 2016, when Funimation struck a deal with Crunchyroll. Going forward, subtitled releases for Funimation licenses would be found on Crunchyroll, while dubbed releases for said titles would be on Funimation’s new streaming platform, However, the only thing that really changed is that instead of Funimation content being hardsubbed on their website, it was now softsubbed on Crunchyroll to the exact same standard: plain text on top center or bottom center, often with three or more lines of dialogue at once, even.Sometimes you could see sign translations on bottom too. Screenshot from  (Spring 2017, Funimation/Crunchyroll)Nothing else of particular note happened during this time period when it comes to Funimation’s subtitles. However, it is worth mentioning that Funimation dubs did have simple hardsubbed typesetting sometimes; this only seemed happen at the whim of the dubbing side of Funimation though, as these hardsubbed signs were never present in the subbed versions, nor were they a consistent feature of Funimation dubs in general.In 2017, Sony purchased Funimation as part of its growing collection of international anime distributors (Sony had previously bought Madman Anime and AnimeLab in Australia and Wakanim in Europe). As a result of this buyout, towards the end of 2018 the license sharing deal between Funimation and Crunchyroll was dissolved and soon after Funimation started serving new subtitled streams on FunimationNow, which were softsubbed and looked like this:No longer were the subtitles even making use of overlaps. Where dialogue translation used to go on bottom and sign translation on top when both were present, now all text was stuck on the same side of the screen together, either on top or bottom, but never both at the same time anymore.How this further reduction in subtitling capabilities came about cannot be said for sure, but there are several possible explanations. For one, another major thing that happened at the end of 2018: Funimation signed a big sublicensing deal with the general streaming service Hulu, which meant dealing with Hulu’s subtitling standards and authoring accordingly limited subtitles – because as could be expected, the subtitling standards of a general streaming service did not account for the needs of anime in any real way.Only the middle column of the blackboard is translated here. Good luck figuring that out with subtitles like these. Screenshot from  (Fall 2019, Funimation/Hulu)Another possible reason for these less-than-great changes in Funimation’s subtitling standards was that around this time the company started using the cloud-based subtitling toolkit OOONA Tools by the localization service provider OOONA. OOONA Tools, by default, do not allow for the creation of subtitles with overlaps. While it can be done in OOONA today by tweaking the options or by using OOONA’s track features (which are quite similar to those of MacCaption, incidentally), it is possible that at the time these features were either not available or that it wasn’t possible to correctly export subtitles with overlaps to the WebVTT subtitle format that was being used on FunimationNow.Screenshot of , the primary subtitling software in OOONA Tools.Regarding that last possibility in particular, there is this OOONA FAQ entry that mentions how not all formats support […] overlapping subtitles and that Currently, it’s supported in IMSC1.1, ITT and Videotron Lambda CAP exports. However, based on my own testing, OOONA Tools can properly export subtitles with overlaps in more formats today than just the ones mentioned here (including WebVTT), meaning that the FAQ entry is in fact outdated – but it was likely true at some point.In any case, this was the extremely limited standard of subtitling that Funimation customers had to live with until the service was shut down in 2024 as a result of the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.Now, what can we conclude from all this? If nothing else, one thing seems abundantly clear: the Funimation leadership never truly cared about or respected anime as a medium. From the very beginning, it’s clear that Gen Fukunaga (a businessman in his 30s at the time) got into the business with the mindset of making money with kids’ cartoons, and this only became more evident with how Funimation tried to expand into more types of kids’ cartoons before eventually realizing that anime is where the money was at.But even with this eventual focus on more anime, no resources seem to have ever been dedicated to make typesetting an actual thing at Funimation, despite how obviously beneficial it would have been for their key product of localized anime. And the way Funimation never even bothered to figure out how to make the most of MacCaption, the expensive enterprise subtitling software they kept using for over a decade… while I speculated about possible technical reasons for Funimation abandoning even overlaps when they started producing softsubs for FunimationNow, there was always one possible additional reason: they just didn’t care at all. They ran into a problem, no resources were dedicated to fix the problem, and the subtitles got permanently worse as a result.Remember the fansubbed version of this from earlier? Here’s Funimation in comparison. Video clip from Danganronpa: The Animation (Summer 2013, Funimation)The whole move to OOONA was questionable in itself, as while OOONA was capable of exporting subtitles to both WebVTT for FunimationNow and TTML (or SRT, a very limited subtitle format) for Hulu in 2018,  Why start paying for a monthly subscription service when your existing paid-for enterprise software should be able to deal with your needs just fine? I suspect the primary motivation behind the move (which could have even originated from the new parent company Sony) might have been the fact that it was trendy for companies at the time to move everything they possibly could to The Cloud™, regardless of how much sense it actually made… but that’s enough about OOONA for now.Ultimately, Funimation’s subtitling standards were extremely poor to begin with, and they only managed to make them worse over time. That is something that only utter indifference or outright disdain for anime as a medium could bring about, which seems to have been the exact attitude that Gen Fukunaga cultivated at the executive levels of Funimation – and his followers appear to have carried the torch even after his departure from the company. But more on that in the next section, when we finally get to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.The Funimation-Crunchyroll merger and its consequencesFollowing Sony’s 2017 purchase of Funimation, in 2019 Sony bought out Gen Fukunaga from the company entirely, which led to him stepping down as the General Manager, with Colin Decker taking his place. Soon after, Sony formed the Funimation Global Group to consolidate all the international anime publishing services it had bought, with Decker in charge of the joint venture as the CEO. Then, in late 2020, Sony announced that they were going to buy Crunchyroll, placing it under the executive control of the Funimation Global Group. The acquisition was completed in August 2021, coming with a statement from Sony that their goal is to “create a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible”.Soon, there would only be one.Then, in March 2022, the news came that Funimation, Crunchyroll, Wakanim, and VRV (Crunchyroll’s more general streaming service) would all be merged together into a single streaming service that would exist under the name of Crunchyroll (as it had the strongest brand of the lot). Funimation Global Group LLC was renamed to Crunchyroll LLC, with Funimation executives remaining in charge. Soon after, Colin Decker stepped down as the CEO, with Rahul Purini (previously COO) taking his place. The merger was complete.Things weren’t much better for those left behind, as laid out in this Bloomberg article from 2024. Staff from Funimation was notably hostile towards those from Crunchyroll:Tension between the camps arose almost immediately. In a Zoom meeting announcing [Sony’s purchase of Crunchyroll], Funimation workers accused Crunchyroll of being pirates, alluding to the site’s history, according to two people who were present.While Crunchyroll workers were quickly frustrated with the new executives from Funimation:Current or former employees describe Crunchyroll’s new management–primarily from Funimation–as out-of-touch with employees and the anime fans the company once prioritized. Some executives write off anime as “kids’ cartoons,” they said, and resist hiring job candidates who describe themselves as fans.How typesetting gets destroyedIn 2025, the executives came up with an idea: Crunchyroll should move away from Aegisub and ASS subtitles with typesetting and start producing exclusively limited TTML subtitles without typesetting in OOONA Tools. The likely end goal of this is to get rid of Crunchyroll’s unique ASS-based subtitle rendering entirely in favor of something more “industry standard” like TTML-based subtitle rendering. This would mean no longer having to pay staff for manual ASS-to-TTML conversion, as well as being able to drop the relatively expensive fully hardsubbed encodes for limited playback environments where ASS rendering is not possible (but some sort of TTML rendering usually is).However, a major change affecting all aspects of the company’s subtitling pipeline doesn’t happen overnight, especially considering Crunchyroll’s large back catalog of ASS subtitles with typesetting that couldn’t be automatically converted to limited TTML subtitles without typesetting. So while the subtitling staff was to be (begrudgingly) busy experimenting and onboarding with OOONA and doing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions for back catalog titles, technical work would also need to be done to prepare for this vision of a TTML-only future.And what an exciting future of not being able to read signs that would be! Screenshot from This Monster Wants to Eat Me (Fall 2025, Crunchyroll)For this purpose, Crunchyroll seems to have decided that it would take its existing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions produced by the subtitling staff and treat them as the new master subtitle files. These TTML “masters” would then be—for the time being—converted back to ASS with Closed Caption Converter for use with the current ASS-based subtitle rendering. And so, with the start of the Fall 2025 anime season, a plan like this was pushed to production; while regular ASS subtitles were still being produced by Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff, these ASS subtitles with typesetting were generally left unused, while only limited ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS conversions without typesetting were being presented to customers on most shows.Implementing this interim pipeline with Closed Caption Converter didn’t seem to go exactly as planned, though, as some Fall 2025 shows on Crunchyroll ended up having no subtitles at all on release, including the premieres of the latest seasons of hit shows My Hero Academia and Spy × Family.Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems – not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved.Quality subtitles are a core part of what makes watching anime on Crunchyroll so special. They connect global fans to the heart of every story, and we take that responsibility seriously.Thank you for your patience. We’re committed to continuing to deliver the authenticity, quality, and care that fans deserve.Following this statement, some of the new Fall 2025 shows have had their ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles switched out to the previously unused regular ASS subtitles. Other shows haven’t. And some shows in the Crunchyroll back catalog have been updated with ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles, though the exact timing of these back catalog updates is unknown.With all of this, the future of typesetting on Crunchyroll is unclear.And that’s how we’ve found ourselves in the situation we face today. Remember what the first Crunchyroll subtitles from 2009 looked like? Yeah, these new subtitles adhering to limited TTML standards are even worse than the subtitles from 2009 in terms of how on-screen text can be handled! In other words: The presentation quality of Crunchyroll’s first-party subtitles has reached an all-time low in 2025.Can’t even handle a next episode preview properly anymore. Screenshot from Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle (Fall 2025, Crunchyroll)There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from that: the Funimation-turned-Crunchyroll executives still do not have any respect for anime as a medium. In addition, they seem to be treating Crunchyroll and its ways of doing things as the ways of  – which isn’t entirely incorrect, as Crunchyroll’s use of Aegisub and ASS  originate from the ways of pirate fansubbers. But fansubbers deeply care about anime as medium (they wouldn’t be illegally subtitling it for free as a hobby otherwise), which in turn means that the ways fansubbers have developed to subtitle anime are in fact extremely efficient for the job – much better than basically any “industry standards” for subtitling, even.But that clearly doesn’t matter to the executives. The only thing that seems to be on their mind is how to best make money with kids’ cartoons that none of them personally watch, and what they seem to consider “best” is getting rid of everything positively unique about Crunchyroll in favor of doing things the Funimation way, even if that means ditching Aegisub and ASS in favor of OOONA Tools and TTML and getting rid of typesetting in the process.  conclusion is further supported by the fact that  with notable reduction in typesetting quality on Blu-ray as a result:Then there’s the whole plan of moving to OOONA in general, which is even more questionable than it was back in the Funimation days. Crunchyroll has a lot more to lose in terms of subtitle quality than Funimation ever did, yet the executives seem to want to go back to their “old reliable” regardless. I can’t even see it saving them any money in the long run, considering that Aegisub is completely free software while OOONA will incur constant ongoing costs with its per-user subscription pricing. Rather than authoring limited TTML in OOONA directly, paying the subtitling staff to keep the manual ASS to TTML conversions going would likely be cheaper!Beyond that, there is also the thing about OOONA being an Israeli company. It is certainly a choice, not only in 2018 but most certainly in 2025, to heavily invest in the services of a company from a country that is actively committing genocide. However, to quell some unsubstantiated internet discourse I have seen in relation to this, I do want to emphasize that OOONA being Israeli is not really directly relevant to the quality issues this article is about.EZTitles is another popular enterprise subtitling software. Notice how they mention AI directly in their navigation.The reason for this lies in enterprise subtitling software (“industry standards”) being universally poor when it comes to producing high quality typesetting for anime, so it wouldn’t really matter which software suite a switch was being made to – no matter what, moving away from Aegisub would destroy typesetting as it currently exists on Crunchyroll. And while Crunchyroll’s CEO has expressed his interest in AI subtitles, at least currently there has been no signs of any kind of AI (Israeli or otherwise) being used to create first-party subtitles on Crunchyroll.Why Crunchyroll is so confident it will get away with this (or: how capitalism ruins everything)Finally, I want to talk about the possible reasons for Crunchyroll executives feeling so confident about getting away with making their own primary product so much worse. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that international anime licensing operates primarily on an exclusive licensing model. This means that generally only one service will be able to offer a specific title in specific language(s) in specific region(s), unless the service voluntarily decides to sublicense it out to others. This in turn upends the assumption that the existence of multiple anime services would be beneficial to consumers, as the services don’t actually have to engage in competition on customer-beneficial factors like service quality almost at all – instead, they can just focus on hoarding as many exclusive licenses as possible.I once asked former Crunchyroll CEO Kun Gao about “exclusivity or completeness” in this Reddit AMA. He dodged the question but basically said “exclusivity”.This kind of “competition” twisted by exclusive licensing is more like a casino, where the customers might occasionally be thrown a bone, but at the end of the day, the house always wins. And the anime companies very much prefer to keep it that way, even if it means never being able to offer full coverage of new anime seasons – a limited amount of exclusives is much more important to them. Dreams of infinite growth are what drives the modern-day game of capitalism, and spending money to please customers rather than shareholders goes directly against said dreams. It’s all about spending as little money as possible to make as much money as possible.This is why the capitalists in charge of all the big companies these days are so excited about AI too: nothing gets them going more than the idea of not having for pay for those pesky human employees. This is no doubt the actual reason why Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini is interested in AI subtitles. It doesn’t matter that anime localization costs are a drop in the bucket compared to the overall costs of anime production, even if you were talking about super high quality work with fansub-level typesetting. Any excuse to cut the wages of real human workers is one step closer to the next yacht purchase for the executive upper class.…Whew, got a bit heated there. Anyway, the most likely reason why Crunchyroll executives believe they can get away with reducing the quality of their own service so much? Because Crunchyroll doesn’t have any meaningful competition thanks to the primarily-exclusive licensing model used by the international anime industry. Even if they make the service worse, what can you do about it? Cancel your subscription and not watch the new anime you’re excited about?If you are currently subscribed to Crunchyroll, cancel your subscription.When asked for a reason, mention the bad subtitle quality and lack of typesetting.You could even link to this article. Beyond that, and this applies to people who aren’t subscribed to Crunchyroll as well:  Share this article around, talk to people about how Crunchyroll is destroying its subtitles, make it so that Crunchyroll executives can’t ignore the issue. And the most important thing: Keep it up until Crunchyroll actually makes a clear public commitment to keep typesetting anime.“Improving Subtitle Quality for Crunchyroll” is what we’d like to see here in 2025.I also want to emphasize that the recent statement Crunchyroll made about its Fall 2025 subtitles isn’t really worth anything. It’s worded in an intentionally obfuscated manner as to what actually has been  – is it the lack of typesetting or just the issues with subtitles not going up for new releases? Then it just outright lies about there being  with how subtitles are being handled, before ending on empty platitudes about  that mean nothing without concrete actions to back them up.And so far,  The lower quality subtitles in the back catalog are especially alarming, as the back catalog was exactly where Crunchyroll also started with its 2017 video quality reduction plans, all the while remaining careful with changes to simulcasts where people were paying closer attention – which is exactly what seems to be happening with subtitles on Crunchyroll right now. Without a clear public commitment to stick to higher subtitling standards that include typesetting, it is very likely that Crunchyroll executives will just delay their typesetting-killing plans and try again later. That’s why  need to cancel your subscription, encourage others to do so, and keep talking about this issue until Crunchyroll explicitly promises to do better.Together, we can save Crunchyroll from itself!This article would have never been as thorough and detailed as it is without the assistance of the following people:The multiple current and former Crunchyroll and Funimation workers who came forward to indepedently confirm the many previously unpublished details found in this article. BigOnAnime – for his great help with researching the historical technical details of Funimation’s subtitling standards. enonibobble – for his help with various screenshots and technical analysis of Crunchyroll subtitles. Faye Duxovni – for bringing Crunchyroll’s use of old Funimation workflows for Blu-rays to my attention and providing the screenshots of it that are used in the article.  who answered public questions I asked or otherwise helped with various small pieces of research. I’m not the only one to have made note of Crunchyroll’s recent subtitle shenanigans, so here’s some additional reading/watching on the subject elsewhere:Why did Crunchyroll’s subtitles just get worse? by  (former head of marketing for Crunchyroll), on the newsletter  This includes some additional details (like numbers!) that I didn’t go over here (because this article was long enough as-is), so I can recommend giving it a read.The Absolute State of Crunchyroll by YouTuber  This is a good watch just to see how bad the new Crunchyroll subtitles look like in action. Additionally, I didn’t really talk about how badly timing quality has been affected by the recent changes too, but this video has some good examples of that as well.Are Subtitles Getting Smaller? by  on . This  column is nominally about subtitles getting visually smaller, but most of it ends up being about the Crunchyroll subtitle situation. Jerome does keep incorrectly saying that general streaming services use the very bare-bones subtitle format SRT rather than TTML, though, and while these services do support SRT for ingestion (ie. content partners can deliver subtitles as SRT) and anime companies might even be making use of that, TTML is what the services actually use internally. SRT does not officially support any kind of positioning whatsoever, which means that even placing subtitles at the top of the screen would be impossible with it if the normal placement was on bottom.The Crunchyroll Sub Flub by  and , also on .

In 2023, another milestone followed with bit-banged USB, showing how far the RP2040’s (and now RP2350) programmable I/O could be pushed.What Can an RP2350 Bit-Bang Next?Now, developer Steve Markgraf (GitHub @steve-m) has extended the concept with Pico-100BASE-TX — a 100 Mbit/s Fast Ethernet transmitter running entirely in software.
Markgraf’s implementation uses the PIO and DMA to perform MLT-3 encoding, 4B5B line coding, and scrambling at a 125 MHz symbol rate. The result is a functioning 100 Mbit/s link capable of streaming about 11 Mbyte/s over UDP, demonstrated by real-time audio and ADC data streams.As before, this is a transmit-only proof of concept and must not be connected to PoE-enabled hardware. A pulse transformer or intermediary Ethernet switch is recommended for isolation.Check Out the Rest of His RepoExample applications in the repository include a counter, internal-ADC streamer, and an audio demo using a PCM1802 converter at 75 kHz. The library supports both the RP2040 and the newer RP2350 (Pico 2) and builds with the standard Pico SDK.Beyond the technical achievement, projects like this hint at new possibilities for low-cost, high-speed data acquisition and streaming using microcontrollers that were never designed for it. A Pico capable of pushing 11 MB/s over Ethernet could form the basis of compact, inexpensive test instruments, remote sensors, or experimental network interfaces — all without a dedicated PHY chip. As these bit-banged interfaces become faster and more capable, the question naturally follows: how far can software-defined hardware really go on a two-dollar microcontroller?

He says the US is in "armed conflict" with the cartels there. But Venezuela has accused the American president of using drug trafficking claims to "fabricate a war" in Latin America.

Sure, criminal informants are seldom the trustworthiest of people, what with their stay-out-of-jail free cards being reliant on their steady production of evidence against other people. But the government does make promises to criminal informants that it’s expected to , not only to fulfill its legal obligations but to prevent informants from being, you know, beaten, tortured, and killed by those they associate with and rat on. But when it’s time to eject as many people with brown skin as possible, all bets are off. If you’re a government informant, maybe it’s time to renege on your own obligations before the government gets you killed. When the Trump government sought to deport hundreds of [checks notes] Venezuelans to El Salvador’s torture prison, “world’s coolest dictator” Nayib Bukele had a favor to ask of his own: the return of nine MS-13 gang members. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a March 13phone call with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, promised the request would be fulfilled, according to officials familiar with the conversation. But there was one obstacle: Some of the MS-13 members Bukele wanted were “informants” under the protection of the U.S. government, Rubio told him.To deport them to El Salvador, Attorney General Pam Bondi would need to terminate the Justice Department’s arrangements with those men, Rubio said. He assured Bukele that Bondi would complete that process and Washington would hand over the MS-13 leaders.Quite the quid pro quo, stripping people of the protection and safety they’d been guaranteed for the sole purpose of getting the green light for mass deportations of Venezuelan migrants. Well, the sole purpose on the  side of the equation. On the other side, there was a benefit beyond a little more burnishing of Bukele’s “tough on crime” reputation. It was also a key step in hindering an ongoing U.S. investigation into his government’s relationship with MS-13, a gang famous for displays of excessive violence in the United States and elsewhere.Basically, the State Department and the Trump administration offered up these gang members as literal human sacrifices in order to pursue its mass deportation program. Nothing greases the wheels like blood, I guess, and this administration’s collective hands have been covered with the substance since Trump’s inauguration. And, as is always the case when authoritarians engage in human trafficking to further their bigoted ideals, the government spokespeople are there to remind everyone that the ends justify the means: “The Trump Administration’s results speak for themselves,” said Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman. “Hardened TdA gang members are back in Venezuela … MS-13 gang members are being prosecuted in the U.S. and El Salvador. And Americans are safer as a result of these incredible efforts.”Neat. I supposed just summarily executing anyone suspected of drug trafficking would probably put a dent in drug trafficking but that’s the sort of thing we just don’t…. hang on a second. I’m sorry. I’m now being told this is  the sort of thing we do, for the first time in our government’s history. My mistake. At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an “armed attack.”“When they’re loaded up with drugs, they’re fair game, and every one of those ships were,” President Trump told reporters last week.Yep. And we’ll never know whether or not these claims have any basis in fact because all of the evidence has been drone-striked to the bottom of the ocean. Instead, we’re just expected to accept the new normal that moves extrajudicial drone strikes from areas of international conflict and into any body of water that might contain boats with Latin/South American citizens in them. Of course, shitting on informants probably doesn’t even raise red flags in the DEA, ATF, CIA, FBI, or any other agency that used to be primarily concerned with actual criminal cases. Most of those resources are now being spent on pursuing people only suspected of  violations of immigration law. If you’re from anywhere south of our border, you’re nothing more than meat puppets for a tyrant and his enablers. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Getting Jacked #jackolantern #halloween</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EW4jBtph6BU</link><author>You Suck At Cooking</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EW4jBtph6BU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 22:31:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w">You Suck At Cooking</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sen.

We are refreshing the codebase, modernizing foundations, and shaping the roadmap with community input.  was founded to build a future of trustworthy, transparent, and controllable AI. Over the past year, we have contributed to  by exploring not only the big cloud hosted large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Gemini, but also the smaller open-weight local models like gpt-oss, Gemma, and Qwen. The  project allows anyone to easily distribute and run LLMs locally using a single executable file. llamafile was started in 2023 on top of the , which allows it to be compiled once but run anywhere (macOS, Linux, Windows, etc). Each llamafile  contains both server code and model weights, making the deployment of an LLM as easy as downloading and executing a single file. It also leverages the popular  project for fast model inference. As the local and open LLM ecosystem has evolved over the years, time has come for llamafile to evolve too. It needs refactoring and upgrades to incorporate newer features available in llama.cpp and develop a refined understanding of the most valuable features for its users.Today, we're happy to announce that the llamafile codebase has officially joined  the . We are excited to be able to help support this pivotal technology and to help build the next generation of llamafile.We're building the next generation of llamafile in the open, and we want our roadmap decisions to be informed by your actual needs and use cases. We'd love to hear your thoughts on:Why did you choose llamafile in the first place?What features do you rely on most?Why are you still using it? (Or, perhaps more tellingly, why did you move to another tool?)What would make llamafile more useful for your work?Over the coming weeks and months, you'll see new activity in the llamafile repository as we incorporate your feedback into our roadmap. The code continues to be public, the issues are open, and we're eager to hear what you think. If you're currently using llamafile, nothing changes for you. Your existing workflows will continue working as expected. GitHub will handle the redirects, and all binaries linked in the repo will remain available.If llamafile has been part of your toolkit, we'd love to know what made it valuable. If you tried it once and moved on, we want to learn why. And if you've never used it but are curious about running AI models locally for the first time, now may be a good time to give it a try ;) llamafile has shown us what was possible as a community. Let’s keep building the next phase together!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bloomberg Surveillance: The Fed Decides 10/29/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tisFLFKncQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2tisFLFKncQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 22:03:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jon Ferro and Tom Keene host a special edition of "Bloomberg Surveillance" covering the Federal Open Market Committee voting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.75%-4%.

The rule will take effect Nov. 25, the company said. To enforce it, Character.AI said, over the next month the company will identify which users are minors and put time limits on their use of the app. Once the measure begins, those users will not be able to converse with the company's chatbots. "We're making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them," said Karandeep Anand, Character.AI's chief executive. He said the company also plans to establish an AI safety lab.
 
Last October, a Florida teenager took his own life after interacting for months with Character.AI chatbots imitating fictitious characters from the Game of Thrones.

Geert Wilder's far-right Freedom party appears to have taken a beating. Last time, they won the highest number of seats. But the first exit poll shows them in second, having lost around 12 seats. The vote was seen as a test of Wilder's popularity after his party walked out of the coalition government, causing its collapse.

The  vets all strategies, and all rewards are automatically converted back to native Bitcoin. Bridging (via ), rebalancing, and reinvesting gains are all handled automatically onchain by the protocol. This approach not only empowers users but also brings vital liquidity to protocols and builders reimagining finance built around Bitcoin.Self-Custodial: Users retain full control of their BTC at all times.Sustainable Rewards: Acre vaults employ time-tested, onchain yield sources.BTC Rewards Only: All rewards are paid directly in Bitcoin, no exposure to unfamiliar tokens or chains.Auto-Compounding: Acre automatically reinvests BTC earnings for maximum growth.Acre’s first vault, estimated 14% APY, is curated by , with vault infrastructure provided by , two trusted leaders in DeFi automation and vault management. Previously only available to institutions and high-net-worth individuals, the strategy includes a portfolio of time-tested techniques (liquidity provision, options, L2 staking) with Re7’s industry-best approach to risk management. Each Acre vault must meet strict risk management criteria and undergo review and approval by the Acre Security Council, ensuring robust oversight and transparency. The Council includes executives and members from Lido, Anagram, LedgerPrime, and Threshold. More information can be found in the .  “Today, Bitcoin holders are forced to choose between giving up control to a custodian or navigating all the complexity of DeFi—bridging, vault rotation, rebalancing, and selling off altcoins–often for barely 1% in yield,” said Laura Wallendal, CEO of Acre.“Acre removes that tradeoff by providing a secure, transparent way to earn compounding yield on BTC, without the custodial risk or typical DeFi complexity.”“The team at Acre has taken a comprehensive approach to building a yield platform rooted in transparency, risk management, and strong governance,” said Evgeny Gokhberg, Founder & CIO at Re7 Capital. “Together, we’re advancing institutional DeFi infrastructure, with this launch marking a key step on Ethereum Mainnet and expanding access to BTC yields within DeFi.”“Acre has taken a collaborative approach, giving BTC holders access to potential earning opportunities while maintaining strong transparency and operational safeguards,” Dennis Dinkelmeyer, CEO of Midas. “Responsible partnerships like this are key to building user confidence and supporting the growth of onchain financial products.”According to , 73% of Bitcoin holders are interested in earning yield, but more than 40% would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products due to concerns around trust and complexity. Acre directly addresses this gap by combining transparent onchain infrastructure with oversight through the Acre Security Council. is a Bitcoin-first platform that helps BTC holders compound their bitcoin while maintaining full control of their assets. By connecting bitcoin to decentralized protocols like lending, insurance, and Bitcoin layer 2 networks, Acre creates a seamless way for users to compound their bitcoin without complexity or the risk from centralized custodians.Founded by the team behind projects like Fold, Casa, Thesis, and tBTC, and supported by leaders at Lido, Eigenlayer, Midas and Re7, Acre brings over a decade of Bitcoin expertise with a focus on simplicity and transparency.To learn more about how Acre is compounding bitcoin, users can visit .:::tip

The story is best told by the hyperscaler companies themselves, and so we asked leaders at Google, Microsoft Azure, and Meta to tell their stories about why and how they adopted SDN. As you will see, they all started from the ideas and principles that came from the NSF-funded research; and each tailored SDN to suit their specific needs and culture.The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication companies also had a strong interest in SDN. AT&T played a large role in its definition, engaging in research and early deployments in the mid 2000s. We invited Albert Greenberg, who was at AT&T at the time, to tell the story.Nicira was perhaps the startup that epitomized the SDN movement. It grew out of the NSF-funded  program and the Clean Slate Program at Stanford, based on the Ph.D. work of Martín Casado. Nicira developed ONIX, the first distributed control plane, used by Google in its infrastructure; OVS, the first OpenFlow-compliant software switch; and NVP (later NSX), the first network virtualization platform. We invited Teemu Koponen, a principal architect at Nicira, to tell the story.During the early 2010s, the networking industry began to realize that SDN has many big advantages. It lifts complex protocols up and out of the switches into the control plane, where it is written in a modern programming language. This made it possible to reason about the correctness of the protocols simply by examining the software controlling the network and the forwarding state maintained by the switches. For the first time, it became possible to formally verify the behavior of a complete network.Researchers, startups, network equipment vendors, and hyperscalers have all taken advantage of SDN principles to develop new ways to verify network behavior. We invited Professor George Varghese, who has been deeply involved in network verification research, to give us his perspective on network verification.A main benefit of SDN is that it hands over the keys (of control) from the networking equipment vendors—who kept their systems closed and proprietary, and hence tended to evolve slowly—to software programmers, who could define the behavior for themselves, often in open source software. And indeed it happened: Today, most large networks are controlled by software written by those who own and operate networks rather than by networking equipment vendors.But what about the hardware? Switches, routers, firewalls, and network interface cards are all built from special-purpose ASICs—highly integrated, cost-effective, and super-fast. The problem was the features and protocols that operated on packets (for example, forwarding, routing, firewalls, and security) were all baked into hardware at the time the chip was designed, two to three years before it was deployed. What if the network owner and operator needed to change and evolve the behavior in their network, for example to add a new way to measure traffic or a new way to verify behavior? A group of researchers and entrepreneurs set out to make the switches and NICs programmable by the user, to allow more rapid improvement and give the operator greater control. Not only did new programmable devices emerge, but a whole open source movement around the P4 programming language.We invited Professor Nate Foster, who leads the P4 language ecosystem, to tell the story of how programmable forwarding planes came about.So far, we have focused on SDN  networks running over electrical and optical cables in datacenters, enterprises, and long-haul WANs. SDN was originally defined with wireline networks in mind.Yet, for cellular networks, the most widely used networks in the world, the need was even greater: Cellular networks have been held back for decades by closed, proprietary, and complex “standards” designed to allow equipment vendors to maintain a strong grip on the market. SDN provides an opportunity to open up networks, introducing well-defined control APIs and interfaces, moving control software to common operating systems running on commodity servers.This story has only just begun, but it started thanks to NSF-funded research in the mid 2000s, then boosted by DARPA-funded programs to support open source software for cellular infrastructure. We invited Guru Parulkar and Oğuz Sunay to tell the story, both of whom developed open source cellular systems at the Open Networking Foundation and for the DARPA-funded Pronto project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FCC&apos;s Gomez Slams Move To Revise Broadband Labels as &apos;Anti-Consumer&apos;</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/10/29/1744228/fccs-gomez-slams-move-to-revise-broadband-labels-as-anti-consumer?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shares a report: The FCC adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to rescind and revise certain rules attached to consumer broadband labels. The measure passed on a two-to-one vote, with Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the FCC, voting no and calling the notice "one of the most anti-consumer items I have seen." 

The vote was held at the Commission's open meeting for the month of October. As per a draft notice circulated earlier this month, the FCC is looking to roll back several rules, including requirements that service providers read the label to consumers via phone, itemize state and local pass-through fees, and display labels in consumer account portals, among others. Advocates at Public Knowledge urged the Commission to reconsider, saying in a recent filing that "the Commission could create a permission structure for ISPs to continue to act without accountability." 

In her remarks during Tuesday's open meeting, Commissioner Gomez appeared to concur, depicting the move as "anti-consumer" and counter to the goals of Congress. The FCC was mandated via the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to create rules for implementing consumer broadband labels. After a lengthy rulemaking process and discussions with industry and consumer groups, ISPs were required to start displaying labels in 2024. 

"I typically vote in favor of notices of proposed rulemaking because I believe in asking balanced questions, even on proposals that I dislike, so that we can encourage fruitful and helpful public comment. Answers to tough questions help us strike the right balance so that our rules can both encourage competition and serve consumers. However, the questions posed in this NPRM are so anti-consumer that I could not bring myself to even agree to them," said Gomez. 

Gomez stressed that the notice will harm consumers by enabling ISPs to hide add-on fees and stripping people of their ability to access information in their own language. Moreover, added Gomez, it's unclear why the FCC is doing this. "What adds insult to injury is that the FCC does not even explain why this proposal is necessary. Make it make sense," she added.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is the human cost of Hurricane Melissa across the Caribbean? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYj-wkmQr7g</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MYj-wkmQr7g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:14:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hurricane Melissa has torn into eastern Cuba after devastating Jamaica.

While computation and verification happen on Bitcoin, a specialized node network is required to:Generate ZK proofs from computationMonitor the system for fraudulent activitySubmit challenge transactions to Bitcoin when fraud is detectedProvide verification services for non-technical usersBOS aims to maximum value accrual by operating a buy-and-burn mechanism. As the BOS network grows and more chains integrate, more computation will be required due to increase in transactions, resulting in more $BOS token payments. This creates a BTC-native economy where $BOS token holders effectively earn BTC-denominated returns as the network grows. The more activity on BOS, the more BTC flows into buying and burning $BOS tokens, creating deflationary pressure while rewarding network participants.Since inception, BOS has announced integrations with key projects from several ecosystems, notably Cardano, Litecoin, Arbitrum, Mode Network, RISC Zero, Merlin Chain and Nubit. BOS has also demonstrated a series of significant technological innovations that unlocks $2.2 trillion worth of Bitcoin liquidity across ecosystems and institutions. The BOS Tokenomics comprises a total supply of 21 billion tokens, a symbolic nod to Bitcoin’s supply. Distribution of the tokens are as follows:Successful pre-sale and airdrop campaigns were conducted earlier in the year, accounting for 3% of the total token allocation. Those who participated in the pre-sale will be able to claim their tokens when trading begins, followed by other early supporter communities including Cardano and EVM ecosystems.  (BOS) is the first platform enabling programmability on Bitcoin without modifying its base protocol. Through zero-knowledge proof technology, BOS unlocks smart contracts, DeFi applications, and cross-chain interoperability—all secured by Bitcoin’s unmatched network security.candice@espoircommunications.com:::tip

Do they find you grounded, credible, and trustworthy, or do you come across as uncertain, inconsistent, and uncommitted?\
Leadership presence isn’t about charisma, power, or authority. It’s not about speaking the most, showcasing intelligence, or dominating the room to prove you’re in charge. Overcompensating, over-explaining, or trying too hard to appear confident can actually do the opposite—they can make you seem disconnected or even insecure. These behaviors can damage your credibility instead of building it.\
Real presence isn’t loud, showy, or forceful. It's a quiet strength. It’s the steady tone of your voice, the calm of your body language, and the consistency with which you act, listen, and communicate. It’s not defined by your intentions, but the impact you have on the people around you. It’s not what you think you’re projecting—it’s how others experience you. It’s the unspoken authority that draws attention and respect, even when you’re not in charge.“Leadership Presence is the ability to show up in a manner that creates more space and connection, inspires one to follow you because they want to (versus have to), and invites authentic presence in others. A solid leadership presence creates impact without saying a word, evokes courage to engage, empowers others to lead, creates safety in connection, and leaves others feeling better, clearer, and even more intentional themselves — just by being in your presence — all via the simple art of intention and being.Your leadership presence is yours for the designing.It can be cultivated, strengthened, and expanded.It can be positive or negative.And it is all contagious.”\
What undermines leadership presence aren’t the big mistakes or the dramatic failures, but the small, repeated behaviors that play out in everyday interactions. Interrupting without realizing, , reacting defensively, or showing up distracted—these seemingly minor habits send powerful signals that can slowly chip away at how others perceive you. The real challenge? Most leaders don’t recognize these habits in themselves.\
Here are the subtle, but significant leadership habits that can quietly sabotage your presence as a leader—they’re easy to overlook, but hard to hide:Second-Guessing or Seeking ValidationDo you constantly seek validation from others before making a choice? Do you regularly second-guess yourself and delay decisions with the fear of making mistakes?\
Seeking inputs is healthy when done with the intent to invite diverse perspectives, but relying too heavily on others to confirm your choices or being indecisive and uncertain in moments where clarity is needed can make you come across as someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing.\
There’s a fine line between being inclusive and being unsure. Crossing that line by not trusting your own judgment can make others start questioning it, too.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:Using tentative language like “I could be wrong, but…” or “Just my two cents…” or “I’m not sure if this makes sense…” signals self-doubt even when your idea or decision may be solid.Revisiting a decision that was already made by asking for more inputs just because you want to be sure creates confusion and reduces trust in your ability to lead.Hesitating to commit unless someone else nods first signals that you’re unsure of your own stance.Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world. Don't let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.\
People don’t expect leaders to have all the answers or always to be right, but they do expect ownership—showing conviction in their decision, taking action, and adjusting as needed.\
Presence requires owning your perspective, even when there’s ambiguity, things are evolving, and the outcome isn’t guaranteed. Stop outsourcing your confidence—trust your judgment, show up with decisiveness, and be willing to adjust as new insights emerge. Give others a reason to trust your leadership.Invisible in Moments That MatterDo you show up in the moments when your presence is most needed—when your team is looking to you for direction, when you need to have hard conversations or give difficult feedback, or when there’s rising tension and chaos?\
Becoming invisible by fading into the background or staying silent when you need to speak up—nodding in agreement when you disagree, holding back opinions, or avoiding decisions when stakes are high—signals that you’re not equipped or willing to lead under pressure.\
Fear of saying the wrong thing, creating conflict, or being judged can make you disappear—not just physically, but emotionally and intellectually as well. But not being fully present, especially in hard moments, makes people lose trust in your ability to lead.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:Remaining quiet in meetings where a tough decision is being debated or a conflict is emerging can make you appear disengaged or unsure, even if you’re simply trying to stay neutral.Automatically saying, “Whatever the team decides…” or “I trust your judgment, go ahead” without offering your own view can seem passive, especially when your insight or direction is expected.Using vague language like  or  or  in moments that require decisive leadership can leave others feeling unanchored or unsupported.Choosing not to give direct feedback, skipping emotionally charged discussions, or letting performance issues slide because they feel uncomfortable can erode your credibility over time.Allowing a team member, peer, or more dominant voice in the room to always handle communication or tough messaging can signal a reluctance to lead from the front.When challenges arise—tight deadlines, unexpected conflict, or scrutiny—you become quieter, more reserved, or disengaged, rather than stepping up and guiding the team through uncertainty.Sometimes the bravest and most important thing you can do is just show up.\
People don’t demand perfection when things are tough, but they do expect you to speak up when everyone else goes silent, stand steady when others hesitate, and to show up with clarity even when the path is uncertain. That’s when true leadership presence is felt.\
Leadership presence isn’t about being around all the time—it’s about showing up when it counts. Choosing not to say anything at all or becoming invisible in pivotal moments makes you come across as someone who lacks the courage and conviction to lead when it matters the most. Show up; stand beside your team.Do you constantly rush, multitask, or appear visibly distracted—jumping between meetings, glancing at your phone while someone is speaking, scanning the room during discussions, cutting people off to save time, or frequently rescheduling one-on-ones? These may seem like small, often necessary trade-offs when you’re short of time and dealing with a packed schedule—but busyness habit sends a message that others are not worth your time and attention.\
Being busy, scattered, hurried, or mentally elsewhere makes others feel unseen, unheard, and unimportant. People just don’t need your physical presence; they need your undivided attention to feel respected, important, and supported. When you appear too busy, refuse to make eye contact, or give others your undivided focus, you come across as inaccessible and uninterested. This creates a psychological barrier to sharing openly, seeking feedback, or trusting you with their growth.\
Busyness creates a quiet emotional distance—being physically present but mentally checked out erodes trust, connection, and leadership presence. Over time, people stop noticing, stop caring, and stop paying attention even when you’re in the room. Your presence fades—not because you’re not there, but because you’re no longer felt.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:Even a quick look at your phone or smartwatch while someone is speaking signals disinterest, making people feel like they’re competing for your attention.Nodding along without truly listening can create the illusion of attention—until others realize you weren’t really tuned in.When you regularly arrive distracted or leave abruptly, it communicates that the meeting—or the people in it—aren’t your priority.Answering emails or prepping for the next meeting while someone is speaking tells them their time with you is transactional, not relational.Repeating questions that have already been addressed reveals inattentiveness—and subtly signals that you weren’t fully present in the conversation.Tethered to our smartphones, we are too caught up and distracted to take the time necessary to sort through complexity or to locate submerged purpose. In our urgent rush to get "there," we are going everywhere but being nowhere. Far too busy managing with transactive speed, we rarely step back to lead with transformative significance.\
People don’t need a leader who’s always in motion. They need a leader who’s present in the moment—someone who’s willing to slow down to listen, focus, and connect. Someone who makes them feel important—not like an interruption. Someone who’s not rushing from task to task, but pausing to build real connections.\
Slow down when it counts. When you’re truly present, even brief moments can feel like an hour of focused leadership. It’s that feeling that leaves a lasting influence—one that builds leadership presence.Ignore the Human ConnectionDo you prioritize work at the expense of relationships—jumping straight into tasks, skipping over personal check-ins, or communicating in a tone that feels more transactional than human?\
When work takes precedence over relationships and outcomes become the sole focus, it’s easy to overlook how your team is really doing. You may miss signs of burnout, disengagement, or personal struggles—moments that call not for direction, but for empathy and support.\
Valuing productivity over relationships creates a subtle but powerful disconnect—people begin to feel like resources, rather than individuals who matter. They may follow instructions, but they won’t feel truly seen, supported, or motivated. Over time, this erodes the very foundation of leadership presence—trust, relatability, and emotional credibility.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:You avoid small talk, personal conversations, or emotional topics because they feel unproductive or too personal for work.You focus only on what needs to be fixed or improved, without pausing to ask how the person is doing, what they’re struggling with, or what support they might need.Your team only hears from you when there’s a deadline, a request, or a problem. This makes your communication feel transactional rather than relational.Your presence isn’t something you put on and take off like a jacket; it’s something you build with every single interaction.\
People don’t just want to be managed—they want to be seen. They want to be recognized not only for what they contribute, but for who they are. And that kind of recognition doesn’t happen by default—it requires intention, presence, and a genuine interest in the person behind the role.\
Leadership presence depends on relational connections, not routines. It’s not about how efficiently you run a meeting, how many goals you check off, or how many targets you achieve. It’s about how you make them feel when doing those things together. Don’t treat people like an item on a to-do list. Slow down. Look up. Be human. That’s where real presence begins.Speak in Vague, Unclear TermsDo you speak in generalities, avoid specifics, or hesitate to take a clear position? Do you speak in vague, indirect, or overly broad terms?\
Saying things like “Let’s see how it goes,” “We’ll figure it out later,” or  leaves people unsure of where you stand or what’s expected. When people are left to interpret your intent—what you really mean, what’s expected, or where things are headed—it leads to confusion and uncertainty.\
People may nod in meetings, but walk away unsure of what action to take. They may make assumptions, draw conclusions, or decide on the wrong path to take. Without the clarity and confidence they expect from a leader, trust begins to slip and momentum stalls. Presence without clarity soon turns into noise.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:When asked for a decision or opinion, you respond with “That’s a great question…” and then sidestep the actual answer. This can create a perception that you’re hesitant, unclear, or unwilling to take a stand.Leaning on jargon or leadership cliches like “synergy,” “alignment,” “leverage,” or “thinking outside the box” without guiding people in clear actions or directions leads to confusion rather than clarity.Offering input like “Do better,” “Be more strategic,” “Try to tighten this up,” or “Think bigger” without specifics makes it hard for others to act on your feedback or meet your expectations.Using passive voice, “Mistakes were made,” “It got overlooked,” or group-blurring terms “We’ll need to think about…” can dilute ownership and make it unclear who is responsible for what.Communication has power. But as with any form of power, it needs to be harnessed effectively or it can all too often backfire.\
As a leader, your voice carries weight. Use it to bring structure to ambiguity, to simplify complexity, and to help others move forward with confidence. Vague, ambiguous language undermines presence. Even when the path is uncertain, your ability to clearly articulate what matters, what’s next, and what’s true gives others the confidence to follow you.\
Clarity doesn’t require perfection—it requires presence, intention, and the courage to be direct. Speak with purpose. Choose clarity over comfort. Unclear words don’t just blur your message—they blur your leadership.Quick to Solve, Slow to ListenDo you have the tendency to jump to solutions without taking the time to understand what’s really going on or how people actually feel? Do you offer advice before others have the chance to finish explaining or steer the conversation toward action without understanding the context behind what’s being said?\
Hearing a problem, fixing it fast, and moving on can feel efficient—you want to be helpful, you want to remove obstacles, you want to keep things moving. But over-indexing on the problem without paying attention to the person behind it can make them feel overlooked and dismissed.\
This habit can quietly push people away. They may stop coming to you for support because involving you often means losing control, giving up ownership, being talked over, or being forced into a solution before they have a chance to think it through. It’s better to hide mistakes, not share concerns, and continue to stay stuck than risk being overshadowed.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:Your first response is advice or action, rather than curiosity or reflection—cutting short someone else’s thought process.You become uncomfortable with pauses and quickly fill them with your ideas, not realizing that those quiet moments are where others gather their thoughts or build the courage to speak.Instead of asking clarifying questions, you reword or reinterpret what others said based on your perspective—subtly taking control of the narrative.You skip over emotions or context and steer the conversation toward action plans, making people feel like their concerns weren’t fully heard.You often use phrases like “It’s simple…” or “Just do this…” which can sound dismissive or minimizing, especially when the issue feels complex or emotionally loaded for the other person.The purpose of the leader is to make sure there is leadership – which is not the same as having all the answers or leading from the front every time.\
The ability to diagnose issues and take corrective action is valuable—but it shouldn’t be done by hijacking the space and sidelining others. You need to collaborate, not dominate. You need to listen, not speak. You need to amplify others’ intelligence, not put a spotlight on yourself.\
Leadership presence isn’t about taking over—it’s about drawing others in. It’s about creating space to listen deeply, reflect collaboratively, and elevate the thinking in the room—not just your own. Slow down. Ask questions. Stay curious a little longer.Unchecked Emotions on DisplayHow do you show up when pressure is high, expectations aren’t met, or communication breaks down? Is there visible tension in your voice, a hint of disappointment in your tone, or impatience in your body language?\
Unchecked emotions like irritation, sarcasm, defensiveness, or emotional withdrawal shake people’s confidence in your leadership. People start worrying about saying or doing things that might trigger an emotional outburst. This makes them hide mistakes, choose words carefully, and play safe as they try to stay out of your way.\
Whether it’s showing frustration in a meeting that disregards your views, aggressive tone in an email that challenges your authority, raising your voice when someone disagrees with you, or passive-aggressive behavior when things don’t go well, these moments don’t just pass away—they linger in the minds of those around you. Your presence becomes associated with emotional reactivity, making people hesitant to lean on you.\
Subtle ways in which this habit can show up:A minor mistake triggers disproportionate anger, disappointment, or criticism—making people feel unsafe to experiment or admit failure.Your tone is dismissive, cold, irritated, or sarcastic—leaving people unsure whether they’re safe to continue.You express frustration with a sigh, eye-roll, smirk, clenched jaw, or visibly tightening posture when someone speaks.You become rigid, justify quickly, or shut down disagreement—often driven by ego or fear.You turn distant, unresponsive, or passive-aggressive when things don’t go your way—silently signaling disapproval without addressing it directly.Big emotions—like anger, fear, and sadness—can be really uncomfortable. But even uncomfortable feelings are okay. In fact, all emotions are okay. It just takes practice to manage uncomfortable emotions so you can respond in a healthy way.\
People notice how you show up—can you stay calm in pressure-filled moments, stay grounded in discomfort, and manage your emotions when things get tough? The steadier you are in difficult moments, the more confident others feel in your leadership.\
Leadership presence is not about suppressing emotions—it’s about regulating them. It means acknowledging them without letting them drive your behavior. Consciously create space between stimulus and response. Respond with intention rather than impulse.Constantly doubting yourself or waiting for others to approve your decisions makes you come across as weak and indecisive. Building leadership presence requires trusting your judgment, even when the path ahead is ambiguous, uncertain, or the outcome isn’t guaranteed—be willing to take a stand and course-correct as needed.Withdrawing during conflict or tough situations tells people they can’t trust you for guidance and support. Leadership presence is not built by hiding, but by showing up when it matters the most.When you rush, multitask, or appear distracted, people in the team feel unseen and unimportant. Being physically present isn’t enough—your full attention is what builds leadership presence.Focusing only on tasks while not taking the time to connect with people makes them feel like tools to get the job done—not individuals who matter. Leadership presence isn’t just about driving outcomes—it’s about seeing, hearing, and understanding the humans behind the work. Acknowledge people, show empathy, and invest in building relationships.Using vague, ambiguous language leads to confusion, misunderstandings, and rework. Clear, direct communication enhances performance and productivity, which makes your leadership stand out and your presence felt.Jumping to solutions without listening can make others feel unheard and dismissed. Leadership presence requires pausing, listening, and showing interest in what others have to say.Visible frustration, defensiveness, or emotional outbursts unsettle teams. Leadership presence requires emotional steadiness, especially in high-pressure moments.This story was previously published here. Follow me on LinkedIn or here for more stories.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Moscow says it tested Poseidon underwater drone, another nuclear &apos;super weapon&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GInK3bzYl1A</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GInK3bzYl1A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 20:42:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Moscow says it tested Poseidon underwater drone, another nuclear 'super weapon'

Neither Microsoft nor Asus would admit there's a problem or offer a timeline to fix it after repeated requests by The Verge. Asus said it needs more time to test. 

Installing Bazzite, a Linux-based operating system, solves the problems, the publication reports. The same hardware runs games up to 30% faster than Windows and beats the Steam Deck in all but one benchmark. Steam runs more responsively without Windows bloat. The device can be used like a Nintendo Switch, pausing games with the power button and resuming hours or days later. Bazzite initially had sleep issues but fixed them two days after programmer Antheas Kapenekakis obtained the hardware and consulted with two AMD contacts. The black Xbox Ally X, which doesn't have as many sleep issues, gets a similar speed boost with Bazzite. 

Two Xbox Ally units tested on Windows repeatedly woke themselves at random intervals. One lost 10% battery after 12 hours of supposed sleep, the other 23%. After another 12 hours, both had only 30% battery remaining. One tried to apply a Windows Update while asleep. Both units refused to wake from sleep at times and required hard resets. Many users have reported similar issues on Reddit with both Xbox Ally versions.

A single mistyped command — rm -rf / — began erasing Toy Story 2 from existence. Character by character, scene by scene, the movie that had taken a year to build vanished in seconds. The team watched in disbelief as Woody’s hat, Buzz’s wings, and entire sets disappeared before their eyes. When engineers rushed to restore from backups, they discovered something worse — the backup system had quietly failed weeks earlier. As IT professionals, we have all been there before, but what can we learn from this and get Buzz to his ship on time?This “Core memory” took place in 1998, with Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull remembering it in his book called “Creativity, Inc.”. The story begins with an unfortunate, unnamed Pixar employee who was doing some routine file clearance on internal servers when they accidentally entered a deletion command on Toy Story 2's root folder…That’s some good news. This “Updating your resume event” resulted in character models and assets disappearing, and the file servers were quickly shut down. \
Unfortunately, by that point, around 90% of the work done on Toy Story 2 was gone, and the sequel's backup system was not working properly for around a month either. At this point, Toy Story 2 would either have to start from scratch - or production would be scrapped altogether.A mother saves the day, just like when Buzz and Woody team up to get home. Galyn Susman, the film’s technical direction supervisor, who would be affected by Disney’s layoffs in 2023, had a copy of the Toy Story project at home. Galyn was on maternity leave and decided to continue working from home – something that is seen as normal today - but at the time, taboo. Being a mother and always planning ahead, just like having children, made it a point to take her work home once a week. This was a huge benefit because it allowed her to stay updated and maintain a reliable backup of Toy Story 2.\
Just like a newborn baby, Pixar carefully transported the laptop back to the office, cradled and wrapped in blankets during the car ride - I imagine they even played lullaby music for the laptop…or maybe that is something I would do. Having the backup from Susman’s laptop allowed the team to copy the files and recover nearly everything that had been lost. \
It was a joyous occasion with many high fives, and maybe put a smile on the face of the person responsible for the deletion. Susman’s backup copy didn’t have the entire movie on her computer, but they were able to retrieve enough to complete and deliver Toy Story 2 on time. Queue the inspirational music and dance like nobody is watching. What a story, right? \
What about the employee who deleted the files? I am glad you are paying attention. So far, there are no reports of them being fired or facing consequences. I will say it’s easy to imagine the tension at the time, and maybe a future project with them working on the backup process.The experience serves as a valuable lesson, not just for the Pixar folks but for IT professionals worldwide. There is a strong commitment to create multiple backups and implement extra security measures to prevent such incidents from happening again. \
In this story, the backup system had failed months earlier, and nobody noticed. That meant there weren’t any backups to restore from, and business was at a standstill. Does that sound familiar to today’s events? It should because it happens a lot these days. What can businesses do to keep safe from this disaster?The 3-2-1 rule - data backup rule is a strategy that recommends keeping three copies of your data, on two different types of storage media, with one copy stored offsite. This method ensures redundancy and protects data from a single point of failure, such as hardware failure, theft, or a local disaster.Offsite backups - An offsite, air-gapped data backup stores a copy of your data in a separate physical or cloud location (offsite) and keeps it disconnected from your primary network (air-gapped). This combination protects your data from localized disasters and cyber threats like ransomware, which cannot remotely access or corrupt the air-gapped backup copy.RPO & RTO - Recovery Point Objective and Recovery Time Objective. It’s not just important, but vital to your business continuity and survival in the event of a disaster. Most businesses state that they have backups tested and that pass the audits, but when they have to restore their systems when a disaster happens, it takes a lot longer than they had planned, and the business loses money because of it.Technical Controls and Permissions: Restricted Folder Deletion Privileges.The simplest prevention would have been to set permissions on the server so that not all employees could delete the top-level directory for the movie. Granting "full control" access to a large group of users is common in collaborative environments, but it is a major security risk. Only a small number of administrators should have the permission to run "delete" commands on critical, high-level folders.Command-level restrictions. The employee used the rm -r Linux command, which deletes a directory and all its contents recursively. A more advanced system could have prevented this command from running at the highest project directory level, either with a special script or by requiring a second authentication step.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Kavanaugh Stop’s Legacy: 50 Days, 170+ Detained Citizens, Zero Answers</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/29/the-kavanaugh-stops-legacy-50-days-170-detained-citizens-zero-answers/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 20:33:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It was just last month that Brett Kavanaugh gave his explanation for why it was perfectly okay for Homeland Security goons to profile brown people and detain them based on nothing more than the color of their skin. While his cowardly colleagues in the majority on that shadow docket decision refused to explain their thinking, Kavanaugh actually wrote a concurrence that was so out of touch with reality as to be embarrassing. But at least it was an explanation.The key bit from him that has stood out is this:Importantly, reasonable suspicion means only that immigration officers may briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status.If the person is a U. S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter. Only if the person is illegally in the United States may the stop lead to further immigration proceedings.It’s this weird, privileged, out-of-touch statement that if ICE or CBP stop you for being brown, they’ll let you go as soon as you show them that you’re an American citizen. Of course, we knew at the time that wasn’t true. Hell, there were details that Kavanaugh ignored in that very lawsuit, which Justice Sotomayor called out in her dissent. But literally in this very lawsuit was the documentation of how it wasn’t so simple:To give just one example,Plaintiff Jason Brian Gavidia is a U.S. citizen who was born and raised in East Los Angelesand identifies as Latino. On the afternoon of June 12, he stepped onto the sidewalk outside of a tow yard in Montebello, California, where he saw agents carrying handguns and military-style rifles. One agent ordered him to “Stop right there” while another “ran towards [him].”The agents repeatedly asked Gavidia whether he is American—and they repeatedly ignored his answer: “I am an American.”The agents asked Gavidia what hospital he was born in—and he explained that he did not know which hospital. “The agents forcefully pushed [Gavidia] up against the metal gated fence, put [his] hands behind [his] back, and twisted [his] arm.” An agent asked again, “What hospital were you born in?” Gavidia again explained that he did not know which hospital and said “East L.A.”He then told the agents he could show them his Real ID. The agents took Gavidia’s ID and his phone and kept his phone for 20 minutes. They never returned his ID.Drexel law professor Anil Kalhan quickly dubbed these bullshit pretextual stops of US citizens as “Kavanaugh stops” and the name has stuck.It feels like every day we hear about another few:ICE violently detain father & son walking to school—teenage boy had to be rushed to hospital."I was just going to school," kid cries out. "I'm underage!"The 16-year-old star athlete is a U.S. citizen—agents sent him to the hospital with severe injuries to his back & neck.Houston, Texas.These Kavanaugh stops are a stain on the American concept of civil liberties and due process, and they should be a stain on Brett Kavanaugh’s legacy. Legal journalist Chris Geidner just ran a piece on 50 days of Kavanaugh stops, and what a shameful moment this is of American bigotry.Geidner has directly submitted questions to Kavanaugh to see how he feels about all of these Kavanaugh stops that show his claim of “brief encounters” with law enforcement were bullshit:I asked Justice Kavanaugh on October 14, “Do you have any comment on the ICE stop of Maria Greeley, a U.S. citizen, who was reportedly stopped, ziptied, and told she didn’t ‘look like’ a ‘Greeley’ despite being a U.S. citizen?“On both occasions, I also asked Kavanaugh whether he still thinks he was correct when he wrote that these stops are “typically brief” and that all of this is fine because “individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.”Finally, I asked Kavanaugh if he was aware of the “Kavanaugh stop” terminology and whether he had any comment on it.So, I asked Justice Kavanaugh on October 16, “Do you have any comment on the Pro Publica report that found ‘more than 50 Americans who were held after [immigration] agents questioned their citizenship’ during 2025. ‘They were almost all Latino,’ per the report.“In addition to the other questions previously raised, I also asked Kavanaugh whether “the possibility of after-the-fact ‘excessive force’ claims” is “a sufficient answer to this ongoing, regularly occurring problem?”Did you guess what happened? Of course you did!I have not received a response from him or his chambers.You can already see the horrific legacy that is forming around the concept of Kavanaugh stops. This is a legacy that doesn’t go away easily. It’s like the Dred Scott decision, the Korematsu decision, or Buck v. Bell. Supreme Court decisions that nearly everyone now looks back on in horror.These are all horrible, hateful decisions by out-of-touch bigots, who can’t even fathom a world in which those less fortunate themselves even matter, and thus their rights and dignity are barely given a second thought.The Supreme Court still has a chance to fix this, since Kavanaugh stops were only defined by Justice Kavanaugh in a shadow docket concurrence. While those other cases all took decades for everyone to realize how fucked up they were, this one we can see in real time what a stain it is for anyone who believes that America respects basic civil liberties like due process and concepts like probable cause.But, for now at least, that stain should stick to Brett Kavanaugh. He’s justified this. He’s insisted these kinds of stops are no big deal, even as there was evidence then, and even with more mounting evidence now, that immigration officials don’t give a shit if you are an American citizen. If you’re darker skinned, they can treat you like shit, lock you up, beat you up, ignore your protestations and even evidence of American citizenship.It is a deep, dark stain on America as a supposed land of freedom, and it should be tied up with Brett Kavanaugh’s legacy forever.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fed Chair Powell Cautions Against Expecting a December Rate Cut</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdojVwYYEsc</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qdojVwYYEsc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 20:11:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warns investors not to assume another interest-rate cut is coming in December, saying it's "not a foregone conclusion."

require a steady approach that ensures China remains hooked on American technology. From a report: The chipmaker is in an "awkward place" as President Donald Trump prepares to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this week, Huang told reporters Tuesday at a company conference in Washington. The Nvidia chief praised Trump's commitment to winning but urged careful engagement with China because of the country's massive software developer base and its growing technology capabilities. 

During the meeting, Trump and Xi are expected to finalize an agreement to ease trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. When it comes to those negotiations, Huang said he has "no idea" if GPUs -- the chips central to artificial intelligence capabilities -- will be a topic between Trump and Xi. 

Huang was careful to leave the negotiating to Trump but encouraged US leadership to think longer term on its overall AI strategy. "A policy that causes America to lose half of the world's developers is not beneficial long-term," Huang said, warning that it was still possible for the US to cede the AI race to China. Keeping US technology in front requires finesse," he said. "It requires balance. It requires long-term thinking."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The messy truth about free speech</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jik3F9zUXgo</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Jik3F9zUXgo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 20:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On September 15, Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show opening monologue included comments about the shooting of right-wing media figure Charlie Kirk, and how the "Maga gang" was "desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” 

Soon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel’s remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 

Kimmel’s suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC’s actions left many questioning whether Kimmel’s First Amendment rights were violated.

This incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the “inalienable right” to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.

After all, courts are not superior to Congress and entitled to micromanage its ordinary operation. And even the best lawsuits still need to clear a variety of justiciability hurdles, any one of which this case could conceivably get stuck on.Nevertheless, the complaint does seem carefully drafted to navigate as many of those hurdles as possible. And principles of judicial review do allow courts to intercede when Congress has tried to act in a way that’s unconstitutional. Which is why this lawsuit is not ridiculous, because at its heart it’s about interceding when Congress has refused to act in a way it was constitutionally obligated, which is little different from interceding when it has acted in a way it is constitutionally forbidden. Passing an unconstitutional statute and refusing to operate the House chamber as constitutionally required are both about Congress exerting its powers in a way that is impermissible, which is what judicial review has long been available to police.The lawsuit basically boils down to this: Arizona has elected an eligible candidate to a congressional term.Ms. Grijalva’s constitutional qualifications have likewise never been in dispute. She meets all of the constitutional qualifications to serve in the House of Representatives, save for the fact that she has not yet taken the oath of office. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 3 (“The … Representatives … shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.”); 5 U.S.C. § 3331 (specifying the language of the oath); 2 U.S.C. § 25 (providing that the Speaker shall administer the oath to Representatives). [paragraph 8]Which means that there is no basis to exclude her. “[T]he Constitution leaves the House without authority to exclude any person, duly elected by his constituents, who meets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the Constitution.” Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 522 (1966). [paragraph 4]But here she is, functionally excluded, unable to do anything she was elected to do. Defendants’ refusal to promptly seat Ms. Grijalva, and to treat her as a member of the House, injures her by denying her the ability to exercise the authority of a member of the House—e.g., to sign petitions, sponsor bills, obtain and provide information to her constituents about federal programs and matters pending before federal agencies, and advocate with federal agencies, all on behalf of her constituents. [paragraph 16]And Arizona is constitutionally entitled to being fully represented for the entirety of the term, but with her absence, it’s not. As of today, Arizona remains entitled to nine representatives. But Arizona presently has eight representatives sworn and seated in Congress, one fewer than the number to which it is entitled. (paragraphs 59-60)Since she is eligible for office, if there were really some issue with her being in Congress then the Constitution spells out the sole remedy: expulsion, which requires a 2/3 majority vote. But it is only available after she has first been seated. Therefore, if the House wishes to remove a member for other reasons, it must first seat the member, then expel by a two-thirds vote. Id.; see id. at 508, 512 (“[E]xclusion and expulsion are not fungible proceedings.”) [paragraph 33]Yet here she is functionally excluded because she has not first been seated, even though no one has the authority to prevent it, not even the Speaker of the House, even if they are ostensibly acting consistent with statutes and House rules that are otherwise constitutional in endowing anyone with the sole authority to offer the oath. The Speaker may not use his statutory obligation to administer the oath under 2 U.S.C. § 25 to arbitrarily delay seating a member when there is no dispute as to the election or qualifications and no practical reason why he is unable to administer the oath. [paragraph 12]The crux of the argument is that those statutes and rules are constitutional only up to the point where they enable Congress to do something that transcends its Article I power. So while ordinarily the House can pass whatever rules it wants to give the Speaker lots of authority (no matter how ill-advised), and the relevant statutes about oaths ordinarily are facially valid, they cease to be valid in a situation as this where they have granted the power to swear in new members exclusively to one person who then refuses to do it.There is some support for this notion, in the 1969 Supreme Court case of  (note that the citation in the complaint dates it to 1966, which appears to be a scrivener’s error possibly due to transposing the year of the election at issue in the case with the year the case was decided). In that case, like this one, someone had been elected, but the House refused to seat him. So he sued for, among other things, an injunction ordering the Speaker of the House to swear him in. His lawsuit was initially dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, with the district courts finding that they had no authority to order the House to operate in any particular way. The appeals court disagreed, finding the courts had the jurisdictional ability to intercede, but it nevertheless dismissing the case on other justiciability grounds. But the Supreme Court then stepped in to keep the case alive, finding that Powell was entitled to a declaratory judgment that he had been unlawfully excluded from the 90th Congress. [p. 489]There are a few different things about that case and this one to keep in mind, but they ultimately don’t seem dispositive. For one thing, in Powell’s case, it was very obvious that the House was trying to impose additional eligibility criteria on him in refusing to seat him, and a major holding of the case is that Congress does not get to create new requirements not already in the Constitution. Here it is less obvious that Congress is trying to impose such requirements on Grijalva, except arguably it still is: it’s functionally created the requirement that a person can not be a Democrat elected in October 2025 and still be seated. But this issue is probably not what the case will turn on; what  stands for more generally is that Congress’s operation is still limited by constitutional text.Another difference is that by the time Powell’s case was decided he had actually been re-elected, and this time actually seated. In fact, it led to some concern that his case might be moot by the time it had reached the Supreme Court, but because the injury he was suing for was essentially for retroactive damages, like a loss in salary, for the period in which he had not been seated it was able to continue in order to address the period of his unlawful exclusion. Whereas in this case, so far at least, the injury seeking remediation—the exclusion—remains current, and the remedy sought is the actual seating.But this lawsuit is following the  roadmap in at least one key way.  Because Powell had already been sworn in by the time the case reached the Supreme Court it meant that the quest to enjoin the Speaker, to force him to swear Powell in, was no longer on the table. That detail may have been important to the rest of the case, because dicta in the decision suggests that the Speech and Debate clause protects actual members of Congress from liability for their actions in Congress, and that protection potentially would preclude being bound by an injunctive remedy.But the decision noted that Speech and Debate clause immunity only extended to actual members of Congress and not the employees effectuating Congress’s operation. The Court first articulated in Kilbourn and followed in Dombrowski v. Eastland[23] the doctrine that, although an action against a Congressman may be barred by the Speech or Debate Clause, legislative employees who participated in the unconstitutional activity are responsible for their acts. [p. 504]Notably, in Arizona’s lawsuit, no one has sued Johnson speaker to have a court order him to swear in Grijalva, which would be a much more uphill argument. Instead it has sued the House itself and senior House employees charged with its operation (the Clerk and Sargent-at-arms), as was proper in the  case. (“Although this action should be dismissed against respondent Congressmen, it may be sustained against their agents.” [p. 550]).It also has made no specific injunctive demand. Instead it demands declaratory judgment, first that Grijalva be declared the sitting rep once she has taken the oath of office and that, because she is eligible, the Constitution and relevant statutes require that anyone authorized to give the oath give her the oath. Because there is no dispute as to Ms. Grijalva’s election or qualifications, the Court should: A. Issue a declaratory judgment stating that Ms. Grijalva shall be deemed a Member of the House of Representatives once she has taken the oath prescribed by law, see 5 U.S.C. § 3331; B. Issue a declaratory judgment stating that if Speaker Johnson has not administered the oath, the oath may be administered to Ms. Grijalva by any person authorized by law to administer oaths under the law of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the State of Arizona[.] [last page of complaint]In other words, what Arizona appears to be looking for is a declaration by the court that if the oath is not administered, the House, and those employed to effectuate its operation, will be breaking the law. And surely no specific injunction is needed to prevent such an occurrence.True, functionally such a decision would trump the House’s current rules manifesting the right to give the oath only to Speaker Johnson. But the operative point is that House rules cannot trump the requirements of the Constitution, which set out the limited circumstances when the oath can be denied, none of which apply here. Since Grijalva is eligible for the office, the Constitution requires that she be admitted to it—the House has no choice in the matter, no matter what sort of statutes and rules it has passed for itself. It is the Constitution that ultimately prescribes and proscribes its power. This lawsuit is about making sure Congress doesn’t somehow help itself to more power, beyond what the Constitution granted it, to exclude a new member and deny its Arizona full representation in the House of Representatives, as Article I of the Constitution entitles it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Philip Goff - Theories of Consciousness</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkOmPGudprU</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CkOmPGudprU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:00:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Register for a free Closer To Truth membership to receive exclusives like early access to new episodes: https://closertotruth.com/register/

Does installing Python, managing virtual environments, and synchronizing dependencies between your colleagues really have to be so difficult? Well… no! A  new tool called uv came out recently that  how easy installing and using Python can be.uv is a free, open-source tool built by Astral, a small startup that has been churning out Python tools (like the excellent linter Ruff) for the past few years. uv can:Install any Python version for youManage virtual environmentsSolve dependency conflicts  quickly ( important for big projects.)What’s best is that it can do all of the above better than any other tool, in my opinion. It’s , written in Rust, and works on almost any operating system or platform.uv is straightforward to install. There are a few ways, but the easiest (in my opinion) is this one-liner command — for Linux and Mac, it’s: https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh or on Windows in powershell:powershell  ByPass You can then access uv with the command . Installing uv will not mess up any of your existing Python installations — it’s a separate tool, so it’s safe to install it just to try it out.Managing Python for a projectIt’s always a good idea to work with virtual environments for any Python project. It keeps different bits of code and dependencies ringfenced from one another, and in my experience, it can save  of hassle to get into the habit of using virtual environments as soon as you can. uv naturally uses virtual environments, so it’s very easy to start using them if you get into using uv.uv will build a Python environment for you based on what’s specified in a  file in the directory (or parent directories) you’re working in.  files are a standard, modern format for specifying dependencies for a Python project. A barebones one might look a bit like this:In essence, it just has to specify which Python version to use and  Adding a name and version number also aren’t a bad idea.(Sidenote: for projects that you publish as packages, such as to the Python Package Index that pip and uv use,  files are a modern way to specify everything you need to publish your package.)Making a new project with uvTo start a new Python project with uv, you can runWhich will create a new project for you, with a , a , and other important bits of boilerplate.There are a lot of different ways to run this command, like  (which only creates a pyproject.toml),  (which sets up a new Python package), and more. I recommend running  to read about them.Once you have/if you already have a  fileOnce you initialize a project — or if you already have a  file in your project — it’s very easy to start using uv. You just need to doin the directory that your  file is in. This command (and in fact, most uv commands if you haven’t ran it already) will:Automatically install a valid version of PythonInstall all dependencies to a new virtual environment in the directory Create a  file in your directory, which saves the  version of  package installed — meaning that other colleagues can replicate your Python environment exactly.In principle, you can ‘activate’ this new virtual environment like any typical virtual environment that you may have seen in other tools, but the most ‘uv-onic’ way to use uv is simply to prepend any command with . This command automatically picks up the correct virtual environment for you and runs your command with it. For instance, to run a script — instead of .venv/bin/activate
python myscript.pywhich will have the same effect. Likewise, to use a ‘tool’ like Jupyter Lab, you can just doin your project’s directory, as opposed to first ‘activating’ the environment and then running  separately.You can always just edit your  file manually: uv will detect the changes and rebuild your project’s virtual environment. But uv also has easier ways to add dependencies — you can just doto add a package, including specifying version constraints (like the above.) This command automatically edits your  for you.  is also extremely powerful for adding remote dependencies from git or elsewhere on your computer (but I won’t get into that here.)Finally, I think that one of the most useful things uv can do is to pin a specific Python version for your project. Doingwould pin the current project to  Python 3.12.9 for you, and anyone else using uv — meaning that you really can replicate the  same Python install across multiple machines.uvx: ignore all of the above and just run a tool, now!But sometimes, you might just want to run a tool quickly — like using Ruff to lint code somewhere, or starting a Jupyter notebook server without an environment, or even just quickly starting an IPython session with pandas installed so you can open up a file. The  command, which has a short alias , makes this insanely easy. Running a command likewill automatically download the tool you want to use and run it in a one-off virtual environment. Once the tool has been downloaded before, this is lightning-fast because of how uv uses caches.There are a lot of occasions when I might want to do this — a common one might be to quickly start an IPython session with pandas installed (using  to add dependencies) so that I can quickly open & look at a parquet file. For instance:uvx  pandas,pyarrow ipythonOr, maybe just starting a Jupyter Lab server so that I can quickly open a Jupyter notebook that a student sent me:uvx  jupyter-core jupyter labOr honestly just so many other weird, one-off use cases where  is really nice to have around. I don’t feel like I’m missing out by always using virtual environments, because  always gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card whenever you need it.If that hasn’t sold you: a personal noteI first discovered uv last year, while working together with our other lovely developers on building The Astrosky Ecosystem — a wonderful project to build open-source social media integrations for astronomers online. But with multiple developers all working asynchronously on multiple operating systems, managing Python installations quickly became a huge task.uv is an incredibly powerful simplification for us that we use across our entire tech stack. As developers, we can all work with identical Python installations, which is especially important given a number of semi-experimental dependencies that we use that have breaking changes with every version. On GitHub Actions, we’re planning to use uv to quickly build a Python environment and run our unit tests. In production, uv already manages Python for all of our servers.It’s just  to always know that Python and package installation will  be handled consistently and correctly across all of our machines. That’s why uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Box CEO Aaron Levie on how AI is changing the enterprise SaaS landscape</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/box-ceo-aaron-levie-on-how-ai-is-changing-the-enterprise-saas-landscape/</link><author>Sarah Perez</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 18:45:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[He painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>San Francisco mayor: ‘We should be the testbed for emerging tech’</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/sf-mayor-we-should-be-the-testbed-for-emerging-tech/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 18:36:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While San Francisco's mayor Daniel Lurie is opening his arms to autonomous vehicles, other cities are more resistant.

It has a unique charm that I find so appealing.← tap/click the left side to go backI was even more amazed when I learned how dithering works.← or use arrow keys to navigate →Look closely, and you’ll see this animation is made of alternating black and white pixels.But these black and white pixels are specifically arranged to create the illusion of multiple shades.That’s what dithering does: it simulates more color variations than what are actually used.Here, it uses black and white to give the impression of multiple gray shades.To me, dithering is about creating the most out of what we have, and that's what amazes me the most!It inspired me to learn more about it, and now I want to share what I’ve learned.Please note that this is just part one out of three, so I’ll only scratch the surface here.I’ll go deeper in the next parts, which will come soon. Stay tuned!First, let’s explore the dithering basics with this grayscale image example.A grayscale image has various gray shades, from black to white.Imagine a display that only shows black or white pixels, no grays. We must turn some pixels black and others white—but how?One way is to map each pixel to the closest available color.Pixels darker than medium gray turn black and lighter ones turn white.This splits pixels into black or white groups.However, this creates a harsh image with abrupt black-white transitions.Shadow details vanish as gray pixels become fully black or white.Dithering fixes this by selectively pushing some pixels towards the opposite color.Some light gray pixels that are closer to white turn black.Likewise, some dark grays turn white.And it's done in a way that produces special patterns which simulate shades by varying the black-and-white pixel densities.Denser black pixels are used in darker areas, while denser white pixels are used in lighter ones.Next question: How are these patterns generated?One simple dithering method, known as ordered dithering, uses a threshold map.A threshold map is a grid of values representing brightness levels, from 0 (darkest) to 1 (brightest).To dither, we compare each input pixel’s brightness to a corresponding threshold value.If a pixel’s brightness exceeds the threshold (it’s brighter than the threshold), the pixel turns white. Otherwise, it turns black.Repeating this for all pixels gives us the black-and-white dither patterns.The threshold map is designed to output patterns where the black-and-white pixel density matches the input image’s shades.So brighter input produces patterns with more white, while darker input produces more black.These black-and-white density variations are what create the illusion of gray shades when viewed from a distance.To dither larger images, we extend the threshold map to match the image size and follow the same principle:Compare each pixel’s brightness to the threshold map, then turn it black or white accordingly.The image now uses only two colors, but its overall appearance is preserved.The variations in shades are now replaced by variations in black/white pixel density of the dithering patterns.And that’s how dithering works in a nutshell: it replicates shades with fewer colors, which are strategically placed to maintain the original look.I find it a bit ironic how I used to think dithering ‘adds’ a cool effect, when what it actually does is ‘remove’ colors!That's all for now! We’ve reached the end, but there’s still a lot more to explore.For example, we haven’t explored the algorithm to create a threshold map. (spoiler: there are many ways!)There’s also another algorithm called error diffusion, which doesn’t use a threshold map.Each algorithm creates a distinct, unique look, which I believe deserves its own article.And that's why I decided to break this series into three parts.In the next part, I’ll dive into various algorithms for creating threshold maps.In the final part, I’ll focus on the error diffusion algorithm.We'll dive even deeper into dithering's mechanisms in these next 2 parts, so stay tuned!visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.If you like this kind of visual article, please consider following me on X/Twitter and sharing this with your friends.I'll keep creating more visual articles like this!https://x.com/damarberlari]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Internet runs on free and open source software and so does the DNS</title><link>https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/the-internet-runs-on-free-and-open-source-softwareand-so-does-the-dns-23-10-2025-en</link><author>ChrisArchitect</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 18:16:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Free and open-source software (FOSS) is not merely common on the Internet; it is a deeply embedded and essential foundation of the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of how we connect online.As governments around the world explore new cybersecurity regulations, the ubiquity of FOSS in DNS operations—from domain registration to retrieval—means that policy decisions made today will have direct implications for the Internet's security and resilience tomorrow.

Source: CIS-77 Home
It is time to take a look that the actual machine instruction format of the 
  x86 CPU family.
  They don't call the x86 CPU a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) for 
  nothing!
  Although more complex instruction encodings exist, no one is going to 
  challenge that the x86 has a complex instruction encoding!
1. x86 Instructions Overview
 x86 Instruction Encoding:
 

Although the diagram seems to imply that instructions can be up to 16 
bytes long, in actuality the x86 will not allow instructions greater 
than 15 bytes in length.

The prefix bytes  the  discussed earlier - they are special bytes to modify the 
behavior of existing instructions.

2. x86 Instruction Format Reference
 Another view of the x86 instruction format:
 

Additional reference:


The x86 CPU supports two basic opcode sizes:
-byte opcode consisting of a 
  opcode expansion prefix byte.
  The second byte then specifies the actual instruction. 
The x86 opcode bytes are 8-bit equivalents of  field 
  that we discussed in simplified encoding.
  This provides for up to 512 different instruction classes, although the x86 
  does not yet use them all.
3.1. x86 ADD Instruction Opcode
  x86 ADD instruction opcode:Bit number , marked , specifies 
  the  of the data transfer:
  If  then the destination operand is a memory 
          location, e.g. If  then the destination operand is a 
          register, e.g. 

Bit number  marked  specifies 
the  of the operands the  instruction operates upon:
If  then the operands are 8-bit registers and 
  memory locations.
  If  then the operands are either 16-bits or 
  32-bits:
  Under 32-bit operating systems the default is 32-bit operands if 
    .
    To specify a 16-bit operand (under Windows or Linux) you must 
    insert a special  in front of the 
    instruction (example of this later.)
  
You'll soon see that this direction bit  creates a 
problem that results in one instruction have two different possible 
opcodes.

4. Encoding x86 Instruction Operands, MOD-REG-R/M Byte

The  byte specifies instruction 
operands and their addressing mode: 


  The  field specifies x86 addressing mode:Register indirect addressing mode or SIB with no displacement
	(when R/M = 100) or Displacement only addressing mode (when R/M = 101).
  One-byte signed displacement follows addressing mode byte(s).
  Four-byte signed displacement follows addressing mode byte(s).
  Register addressing mode.
  
  The  field specifies source or destination 
  :Register if data size is eight bits
    Register if data size is 16-bits
    Register if data size is 32 bits
  
The  field, combined with , 
specifies either
the second operand in a -operand instruction, or
  the only operand in a -operand instruction 
      like  or .

The  bit in the opcode determines which operand is 
the source, and which is the destination:
, REG is the source 
  , REG is the destination
 Technically, registers do not have an 
address, but we apply the term  to registers 
nonetheless.

5. General-Purpose Registers
  Since the processor accesses registers more quickly than it accesses 
  memory, you can make your programs run faster by keeping the 
  most-frequently used data in registers.
The , , , 
    , , , 
    and  registers are 32-bit 
    general-purpose registers, used for temporary data storage and memory 
    access.
  The , , , 
    , , , and 
     registers are 16-bit equivalents of 
    the above, they represent the low-order 16 bits of 32-bit registers.
  The , , , and 
     registers represent the high-order 8 
    bits of the corresponding registers.
  Similarly, , , , and  represent the low-order 8 bits of the registers. 
6. REG Field of the MOD-REG-R/M Byte

See MOD-REG-R/M Byte.

Depending on the instruction,
this can be either the  or the destination operand.

Many instructions have the  (direction) field in 
their opcode to choose  operand role:
If ,  is the source, 
  .
  If ,  is the destination,
  . 
 For certain (often single-operand or 
  immediate-operand) instructions, the  field may contain an 
   rather than the register bits. The 
   field will specify the operand in such case.

Addressing modes with 8-bit displacement fall in the range -128..+127 
    and require only a single byte displacement after the opcode (Faster!)
  The size bit in the opcode specifies 8 or 32-bit register size.
    To select a 16-bit register requires a prefix byte.
  The so-called scaled indexed addressing modes,  = 
    scaled index byte mode.
  Note that there is no [  ] addressing.
    It's slot is occupied by the 32-bit  addressing mode.
    Intel decided that programmers can use [ +  ] 
    addressing mode instead, with its 8-bit displacement set equal to zero 
    (instruction is a little longer, though.) 
8. SIB (Scaled Index Byte) Layout
  Scaled index byte layout:Scaled indexed addressing mode uses the second byte (namely, 
     byte) that follows the  
    byte in the instruction format.
  The  field still specifies the displacement size 
    of , , or  
    bytes.
  The  and SIB bytes are complex, because 
      Intel reused 16-bit addressing circuitry in the 32-bit mode, rather 
      than simply abandoning the 16-bit format in the 32-bit mode.
    There are good hardware reasons for this, but the end result is a 
      complex scheme for specifying addressing modes in the opcodes.

     00 100  
     01 100   + 
     10 100   + 
The  and  fields of the SIB 
byte select the base and index registers, respectively.

Note that this addressing mode does not allow the use of the 
 register as an index register. Presumably, Intel 
left this particular mode undefined to provide the ability to extend the 
addressing modes in a future version of the CPU.
9.1. Encoding ADD Instruction ExampleThe opcode can 
  be decimal 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the direction and size bits in the 
  opcode: How could we encode various forms of the  instruction using different addressing modes? 
  9.2 Encoding ADD CL, AL InstructionInteresting side effect of the direction bit and the  organization: some instructions can have two different opcodes, 
  and both are legal! could be  (if ), or , if  bit is set to . The possibility of opcode duality issue here applies to all instructions 
  with two register operands. 9.3. Encoding ADD ECX, EAX InstructionNote that we could also encode ,  using the bytes . 9.4. Encoding ADD EDX, DISPLACEMENT InstructionEncoding the ,

    9.9. Encoding ADD ECX, [ EBX + EDI*4 ] InstructionEncoding the , [ 
   + *4 ] Instruction     add ecx, [ ebx + edi*4 ]
    10. Encoding ADD Immediate Instruction
 Encoding x86 immediate operands:
  and  bytes have no 
bit combinations to specify an immediate operand.

Instead, x86 uses a entirely different instruction format to specify instruction with an immediate operand.

There are three rules that apply:
If opcode high-order bit set to , then instruction 
  has an immediate constant.
  There is no direction bit in the opcode:
  : indeed, you cannot specify a constant as a destination operand!
    Therefore, destination operand is always the location encoded in the 
     bits of the the  byte. 
    In place of the direction bit , the opcode has a sign 
    extension  bit instead:
    For 8-bit operands, the CPU ignores  bit.
      For 16-bit and 32-bit operands,  bit specifies the 
      size of the  following at 
      the end of the instruction:
      If  bit contains , the  is the same 
        size as the operand (i.e., 16 or 32 bits).
        If  bit contains , the  is a  8-bit value, and the CPU sign-extends 
        this value to the appropriate size before adding it to the operand. 
      This little  trick often makes programs shorter, 
      because adding small-value constants to 16 or 32 bit operands is very 
      common.
    The third difference between the -immediate and the standard  instruction is the meaning of the 
   field in the  byte:
  Since the instruction implies that
    the source operand is a constant, and
       fields specify the destination operand, 
    
    the instruction does not need to use the  field to 
    specify an operand.
    Instead, the x86 CPU uses these three bits as an .
    For the -immediate instruction the 
     bits must contain zero.
    Other bit patterns would correspond to a different instruction. 
  
  Note that when adding a constant to a memory location, the displacement (if 
  any) immediately precedes the immediate (constant) value in the opcode 
  sequence.
11. Encoding Eight, Sixteen, and Thirty-Two Bit Operands
 x86 ADD Opcode:
 When Intel designed the 8086, one bit in the opcode, 
        , selected between 8 and 16 bit integer operand sizes. 
  Later, when CPU added 32-bit integers to its architecture on 80386 
        chip, there was a problem:
  three encodings were needed to support 8, 16, and 32 bit sizes. 
  Solution was an .
  Intel studied x86 instruction set and came to the conclusion:
  in a 32-bit environment, programs were more likely to use 8-bit and 
    32-bit operands far more often than 16-bit operands.
  So Intel decided to let the size bit  in the opcode 
  select between 8- and 32-bit operands.
11.1. Encoding Sixteen Bit Operands
 x86 instruction format:
 

32-bit programs don't use 16-bit operands that often, but they do 
need them now and then.

To allow for 16-bit operands, Intel added prefix a 32-bit mode 
instruction with the  with value 
.

This prefix byte tells the CPU to operand on 16-bit data rather than 
32-bit data.

There is nothing programmer has to do explicitly to put an operand size 
  prefix byte in front of a 16-bit instruction:
  the assembler does this automatically as soon as 16-bit operand is found 
    in the instruction.
  However, keep in mind that whenever you use a 16-bit operand in a 32-bit 
  program, the instruction is longer by one byte:    Opcode     Instruction

    41h         ECX
    66h 41h     CXBe careful about using 16-bit instructions if size (and to a lesser extent, 
  speed) are important, because
  instructions are longer, and
    slower because of their effect on the instruction cache.
  12. x86 Instruction Prefix BytesEach prefix adjusts interpretation of the opcode:
   prefix byte guarantees that instruction will 
    have exclusive use of all shared memory, until the instruction completes 
    execution: instruction prefixes
    where
     repeats instruction the number of 
      times specified by .
       and  prefixes allow to terminate loop on the 
      value of  CPU flag.
    
    Related string manipulation instructions are:
    , compare string, etc. 
    
    See also string manipulation sample program:  prefix causes memory access to use 
     instead of  designated 
    for instruction operand.        2Eh = 
        36h = 
        3Eh = 
        26h = 
        64h = 
        65h = , . Changes size of 
    data expected by default mode of the instruction e.g. 16-bit to 32-bit and 
    vice versa. 
    , . Changes size of 
    address expected by the instruction. 32-bit address could switch to 16-bit 
    and vice versa.
  13. Alternate Encodings for InstructionsTo shorten program code, Intel created alternate (shorter) encodings of 
  some very commonly used instructions.
  For example, x86 provides a single byte opcode for    add al, constant    ; one-byte opcode and no MOD-REG-R/M byte
    add eax, constant   ; one-byte opcode and no MOD-REG-R/M byte
  the opcodes are  and , 
  respectively. Also,
  These instructions are one byte shorter than their standard
   immediate counterparts.
  Note that    add ax, constant   ; operand size prefix byte + one-byte opcode, no MOD-REG-R/M byte
  requires an operand size prefix just as a standard ,  
  instruction, yet is still one byte shorter than the corresponding standard 
  version of  immediate.
  Any decent assembler will  choose the shortest 
  possible instruction when translating program into machine code.
  Intel only provides alternate encodings only for the accumulator registers 
  , , .
  This is a good reason to use accumulator registers if you have a choice 
  
    (also a good reason to take some time and study encodings of the x86 
    instructions.) x86 opcodes are represented by one or two bytes.
  Opcode could extend into unused bits of  byte. 
  Opcode encodes information about
  size of each operand, including the size of an immediate operand. 
  14.1. MOD-REG-R/M Byte Summary
 MOD-REG-R/M Byte:
  byte follows one or two opcode bytes of 
        the instructionIt provides  information for one or two 
        operands.
  If operand is in , or operand is a 
  :
   field (bits [7:6]), combined with the 
     field (bits [2:0]), specify / 
    operand, as well as its .
     field (bits [5:3]) specifies another  operand in of the two-operand 
    instruction.
  15. ISA Design ConsiderationsInstruction set architecture design that can stand the test of time is a 
  true intellectual challenge.
  It takes several compromises between space and efficiency to assign opcodes 
  and encode instruction formats.
  Today people are using Intel x86 instruction set for purposes never 
  intended by original designers.
  Extending the CPU is a very difficult task.
  The instruction set can become .
  If x86 CPU was designed  today, it would have a 
  totally different ISA!
  Software developers usually don't have a problem adapting to a new 
  architecture when writing new software...
  
    ...but they are very resistant to moving existing software from one 
    platform to another. This is the primary reason the Intel x86 platform remains so popular to 
  this day.
15.1. ISA Design Challenges Allowing for future expansion of the chip requires some .
  From the beginning there should be a balance between the number of 
  undefined opcodes and
  the number of initial instructions, and
    the size of your opcodes (including special assignments.)
  Hard decisions:
  Reduce the number of instructions in the initial instruction set?
    Increase the size of the opcode?
    Rely on an opcode prefix byte(s), which makes later added instructions 
    longer?
  There are no easy answers to these challenges for CPU designers!
16. Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual

Classic Intel Pentium II Architecture Software Developer's Manual contains 
three parts:

It is highly recommended that you download the above manuals and use them 
as a reference.

16.1. Intel Instruction Set Reference (Volume2) of the
  Instruction Set Reference describes
  each Intel instruction in detail
    algorithmic description of each operation
    operand(s), their sizes and attributes
    CPU exceptions that may be generated.
  The instructions are arranged in alphabetical order.
   provides  for the entire 
  Intel Architecture instruction set.
16.2. Chapter 3 of Intel Instruction Set Reference begins with instruction format example and 
  explains the  column encoding.
  The  column gives the complete machine 
  codes as it is understood by the CPU.
  When possible, the actual  are given as exact 
  hexadecimal bytes, in the same order in which they appear in memory.
  However, there are opcode definitions other than hexadecimal bytes...
16.3. Intel Reference Opcode BytesFow example,
  16.4. Intel Reference Opcode Bytes, Cont. - A digit between 0 and 7 indicates that
  The  field of  byte contains 
    the instruction opcode extension.
    The  (register or memory) operand of  byte indicates
    R/M Addressing Mode
    === ===========================
    000 register ( al / ax / eax )
    001 register ( cl / cx / ecx )
    010 register ( dl / dx / edx )
    011 register ( bl / bx / ebx )
    100 register ( ah / sp / esp )
    101 register ( ch / bp / ebp )
    110 register ( dh / si / esi )
    111 register ( bh / di / edi )The size bit in the opcode specifies 8 or 32-bit register size.
  A 16-bit register requires a prefix byte:    Opcode     Instruction
    --------   ------------
    41h         ECX
    66h 41h     CX16.5. Intel Reference Opcode Bytes, Cont. - Indicates that the instruction uses the  byte of the instruction.
   byte contains both
  an  (register or memory) operand.
  16.6. Intel Reference Opcode Bytes, Cont.  - A 1-byte (cb), 2-byte (cw), 4-byte (cd), or 
  6-byte (cp) value, following the opcode, is used to specify
  and possibly a new value for the code segment register .
  16.7. Intel Reference Opcode Bytes, Cont. - A 1-byte (ib), 2-byte (iw), or 4-byte (id) indicates 
  presence of the  in the instruction.
  Typical order of opcode bytes is
   scale-indexing byte (optional)
    The opcode determines if the operand is a signed value.
  All words and doublewords are given with the low-order byte first (little endian).
16.8. Intel Reference Opcode Bytes, Cont. - A register code, from 0 through 7, added to the 
  hexadecimal byte given at the left of the plus sign to form a single opcode 
  byte.
  Register Encodings Associated with the , 
  , and :
  16.9. Intel Reference Instruction ColumnThe  column gives the syntax of the instruction 
  statement as it would appear in a 386 Assembly program.

But given how completely Congress—and particularly the Senate—has rolled over for every Trump demand since January, any defection is notable. And this one is particularly telling about where the cracks might finally start to form.To understand why this matters, you need to understand just how absurd these particular tariffs were—even by Trump tariff standards.The President doesn’t have the power to issue tariffs. That’s supposed to be a power reserved for Congress under the Constitution. Trump has been skirting around that by claiming that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) allows him to take certain actions in an emergency regarding trade, but the law does not explicitly allow him to impose tariffs under that authority. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case challenging Trump’s interpretation of IEEPA next week.But even if SCOTUS somehow blesses this IEEPA theory, the Brazil tariffs are uniquely indefensible. Trump’s other tariffs at least gesture at the fiction that trade deficits constitute emergencies. Economically illiterate, sure, but there’s a pretext.But we have a trade surplus, rather than a deficit, with Brazil. So, instead, Trump just claimed that the “emergency” was stupid actions by Brazil’s Supreme Court to push for censorship on social media. We’re among those who have called out some of those dumb and censorial decisions by Brazil’s Supreme Court. But that doesn’t make any of them an “emergency.” The other reason given: the fact that Brazil actually prosecuted Trump buddy Jair Bolsonaro for… trying to run a coup on the government. That is… not an emergency that lets Trump issue tariffs.In other words: Trump declared an economic emergency because a foreign country’s courts made decisions he didn’t like about speech online and because they prosecuted his friend for attempting a coup. He may try to call that trade policy, but everyone can easily see that it’s a personal vendetta dressed up in legal language to give his most adoring fans a weak excuse to defend him.Of course, the House (should Mike Johnson ever bring it back from vacation) is unlikely to move on this bill, and Trump will veto the bill anyway.But… it’s one of the first real cracks in the MAGA cult red wall of giving Donald Trump anything the special boy wants. In this second Trump administration, it seems like one of the only times the Senate has actually voted against him.So why now? Why this particular abuse of power?Perhaps it’s that at least some Republicans can read polls too. This is the least popular president in modern history, and his policies (even the ones we were always told had popular support) are ridiculously unpopular as well. The Economist’s graphic on this is telling. Trump is negative on… basically everything. By a lot.And, for stupidly unclear reasons, Congress just keeps letting him do whatever the fuck he wants to do.The polls are brutal. His policies are historically unpopular. He’s tearing down the White House. He’s made the US into a global laughingstock. He’s sending troops into American cities based on myths his advisors are telling him. There are millions protesting in the streets.And at some point, the political calculus shifts—even for Republicans in gerrymandered districts who’ve spent ten months scared shitless that the MAGA base will turn on them. Eventually, the risk of being primaried by Trump becomes less scary than the risk of being associated with a deeply unpopular president doing deeply unpopular things for transparently personal reasons.So, no, this isn’t a big shift. But it’s a little one. An important crack in the wall, which hopefully starts to turn into more.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: 1 Year Sam’s Club Plus Membership with Auto-Renew</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/29/daily-deal-1-year-sams-club-plus-membership-with-auto-renew/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 17:44:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sam’s Club is a membership warehouse club, a limited-item business model that offers members quality products at an exceptional value unmatched by traditional retail.

But there’s no one left with any of these traits in the White House, so we get the sort of thing we’re now seeing with increasing frequency: Trump (deliberately or not) forgetting who was sitting in the Oval Office in 2020.You know the old cartoon representation of the conscience — the devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other? When I imagine Trump occasionally having a second thought before speaking/posting, all I see are a bunch of little Trumps on both shoulders waving “GO DONNY!” flags. President Donald Trump blamed the Capitol riot on former President Joe Biden, claiming that “THE BIDEN FBI” had placed agents in the crowd that had assembled in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6. 2021.Trump’s post came in the wee hours of Sunday, at 12:38 a.m.“THE BIDEN FBI PLACED 274 AGENTS INTO THE CROWD ON JANUARY 6,” he wrote on Truth Social. “If this is so, which it is, a lot of very good people will be owed big apologies. What a SCAM – DO SOMETHING!!! President DJT”This is obviously  so, which anyone should immediately know, since it was still  FBI up until he left office (unwillingly and one insurrection attempt later) two weeks later. Had he just said “the FBI” instead of “the  FBI,” he might have been able to make a point, however implausible that point might be. Instead, he went the other way and blamed the guy who didn’t even have an FBI to call his own while Trump supporters raided the Capitol building in hopes of overturning an election. But arguments that these statements are deliberate and evidence of 4-D chess fall apart the more often Trump does the same thing. Instead of looking like a mismanaged disinformation campaign, it just looks demented. And I don’t mean colloquially. I mean in the literal, medical sense of the word. Just in: Documents show conclusively that Christopher Wray, Deranged Jack  Smith, Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, and other crooked lowlifes from the failed Biden Administration, signed off on Operation Arctic Frost. They spied on Senators and Congressmen/women, and even taped their calls. They cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election. These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!At best, Trump has a legitimate complaint against Christopher Wray (who was heading the FBI in 2020). And by “legitimate,” I only mean he was actually employed by the FBI at the point in time referenced by Donald Trump.But everyone else was appointed by Joe Biden  he took over as president in . To claim they somehow “rigged” an election is literally insane. Merrick Garland was a federal judge while Trump was in office. Jack Smith was still at The Hague. Lisa Monaco was a Biden advisor during his presidential campaign. The only person who could have conceivably been part of an inside job was someone who was still working for Trump at the time: Christopher Wray.Trump has already published an enemies list to the White House website. Stuff like this appears to be the venting of his private list of people he doesn’t like. He recognizes some names and gets angry, never bothering to consider relevant details like, say, who was actually in charge of the place when he was apparently getting screwed over by the democratic process. Back in his first term, there were still enough people around him to help curb these impulses a bit. I mean, no one could really control him when he went off-script but he didn’t spend nearly as much time just blasting disjointed social media buckshot into the void. The people that surround him now perform only two tasks in response to things like these: (1) engaging in massive amounts of spin or (2) just pretending it didn’t happen.This isn’t healthy. The GOP is almost entirely composed of people pretending to be mad about “woke” stuff while ensuring the garden hose aimed at the authoritarian kudzu never gets shut off. They’re doomed to repeat the past because they learned all the wrong lessons from it. Sooner or later, every authoritarian regime begins eating its own. At some point, they’ll be up against the wall, having sold their souls for the privilege of being executed by their compatriots. And the longer they pretend no one needs to tell Donald Trump “no,” the more inevitable this endpoint becomes. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will Sudan be Trump’s next peace deal pursuit?</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/will-sudan-be-trumps-next-peace-deal-pursuit</link><author>Anushka Asthana</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:26:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Across the world, those embroiled in conflicts are increasingly looking towards Donald Trump – including in places that you would not consider a likely priority for this Republican ‘America First’ president.Some argued that under Joe Biden, the Democrats may have cared about what was happening, but it was low down the list, far behind conflicts in Europe and the Middle East.“The Sudan war has been extraordinarily resistant to peacemaking efforts – with US involvement not leading to a breakthrough so far.”– Alan Boswell, International Crisis Group,Biden’s envoy to Sudan reported to the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs – hardly offering a direct line into the White House.At first, there appeared to be even less hope of Sudan holding the attention of the White House under Trump.But has something changed?Alan Boswell, Horn of Africa director for the International Crisis Group, has argued that the Sudan war has been extraordinarily resistant to peacemaking efforts – with US involvement not leading to a breakthrough so far.But he says that when he talks to those involved in peacemaking talks in the region, they all talk about how to gain Trump’s attention.And, he argues, there are three reasons why those figures may be holding out hope for the current president, despite it falling flat with Biden.The first is that Trump’s envoy to Africa wants to make a mark, and moreover, has a direct link into the White House. Massad Boulos happens to have a personal connection; as his son is married to the president’s daughter, Tiffany Trump.The second is that the Arab countries who have become key players in trying to resolve this conflict have strong ties to the US, and Trump has been working on strengthening those ties.“The US was part of the ‘Quad’ of countries that put forward a path to peace in September, but neither of the two armed groups involved in the actual fighting signed up.”And the third – according to Boswell – is that his ongoing desire to secure a Nobel Peace Prize is making him turn to those conflicts that previously would not have been high up the US’ strategic interests.After overseeing Cambodia and Thailand signing an agreement (he said peace deal, though the Thai foreign minister would not go beyond a possible path to peace) the Cambodian Prime Minister said he would nominate Trump himself.So, could he be tempted to put more effort into Sudan? Things don’t appear hugely hopeful at the moment.“After all, President Trump isn’t only in this for a prize – the reality is that, in many of these conflicts, there is potential economic gain for the US.”The US was part of the ‘Quad’ of countries (including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates) that put forward a path to peace in September, but neither of the two armed groups involved in the actual fighting (the SAF and RSF) signed up – and have since either rejected or ignored the plan.Fresh hope with meetings scheduledSince then, the US has tried again, convening a meeting on Friday including the Sudanese Foreign Minister, and trying to push towards a three month humanitarian pause.And on that, the armed groups have at least engaged.That is why – despite recent scenes – Boswell says he does not think things are hopeless.But he also admits that the same figures who are wondering how to gain Trump’s attention are also “hyperaware that the attention might not last long.”After all, President Trump isn’t only in this for a prize – the reality is that, in many of these conflicts, there is potential economic gain for the US.A satellite photo provided by Planet Labs PBC, showing the area around the headquarters of the Sudanese military’s 6th Division in El-Fasher, Sudan, on October 26.Take another African conflict – between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, where Trump may claim peace but the reality on the ground tells a different story.Any aftermath there could pave the way for lucrative mining deals that the US could benefit from.A worry for those linked to the Sudanese conflict, who believe that Trump’s interest could shift the dial, fear there may not be enough to gain economically in Sudan, to hold this US President’s glare.As Donald Trump continues his Asia tour, all eyes are on his upcoming meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday – amid a fierce trade war and fraught geopolitical backdrop.In this week’s episode of our TrumpWorld podcast, Anushka Asthana and Matt Frei break down what we can expect from this meeting and what’s at stake; from trade deals to tech tensions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tailscale Peer Relays</title><link>https://tailscale.com/blog/peer-relays-beta</link><author>seemaze</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:21:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tailscale Peer Relays provides a customer-deployed and managed traffic relaying mechanism. By advertising itself as a peer relay, a Tailscale node can relay traffic for any peer nodes on the tailnet, even for traffic bound to itself. Tailscale Peer Relays can only relay traffic for nodes on your tailnet, and only for nodes that have access to the peer relay. Because they’re managed entirely by the customer, peer relays are less throughput-constrained than Tailscale’s managed DERP relays, and can provide higher throughput connections for traffic to and from locked-down cloud infrastructure, or behind strict network firewalls.In testing with early design partners, we’ve seen throughputs nearing that of a direct connection; often multiple orders of magnitude higher than Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet.While we’ve been keeping your network reliably connected for years with DERP, we’ve heard from customers that the throughput and performance aspects of a QoS-aware managed relay fleet makes deployments in certain environments difficult or untenable. Furthermore, customers have noted that it’s non-trivial to deploy and manage custom DERP fleets (which run as a separate service and binary).DERP provides an incredibly valuable service, setting up reliable connections between Tailscale clients anywhere in the world (including negotiating connections through peer relays). But often, DERP’s focus as a reliability and NAT traversal tool results in performance tradeoffs.By contrast, Tailscale Peer Relays is designed as a performant connectivity tool, and can perform at a level rivaling direct connections. Peer relays can be placed right next to the resources they serve, and peer relays also run on top of UDP, both characteristics beneficial to lower latency and resource overhead. And, they are built into the Tailscale client itself for ease of deployment.We want to move past even more hard NATs, and put Tailscale’s relaying technology in our customers’ hands, so they can use Tailscale at scale, anywhere, with ease. We believe our new Tailscale Peer Relays connectivity option—unique to Tailscale—gives customers the best performance and flexibility.Peer relays are configured with a single UDP port that must be available to both sides of a connection. Tailscale Peer Relays is built right into the Tailscale client, and can be enabled with a simple command, using the tailscale set --relay-server-port flag from the Tailscale CLI. Once enabled via the steps in our documentation, clients can connect to infrastructure in hard NAT environments over the peer relay.And don’t worry, we still prefer to fly direct. Tailscale prefers direct connections wherever possible. Clients can then fall back to available peer relays, and finally leverage Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet, or any customer-deployed custom DERPs, to ensure you have connectivity wherever you need it. All of this traffic, over any connection, is still end-to-end encrypted via WireGuard®.Tailscale Peer Relays is designed for the real world, based on the feedback we’ve received from customers and our own hard-earned networking expertise. It allows customers to make just one firewall exception for connections only coming from their tailnet. Peer relays scale across regions, are resilient to real-world network conditions, and graciously fall back to DERP (Tailscale’s or custom). Your network maintains its shape, but gains all kinds of flexibility.Customers can now maintain performance benchmarks even where direct connections aren’t possible, by enabling Tailscale Peer Relays to build a deterministic and high-throughput relay topology.We’ve had customers use peer relays to provide access into unmanaged networks, allowing their partners or customers to provide a controllable and auditable connectivity path without sacrificing performance.In strict private networks, customers can build predictable access paths. Tailscale Peer Relays can be placed in public subnets with VPC peering to private subnets, allowing security teams to efficiently segment their private network infrastructure, while enabling networking teams to roll Tailscale out in full-mesh mode across the subnet.Today, customers are using peer relays to establish relayed connections at near-direct speeds across a variety of environments and settings.Enable high-throughput traffic through cloud NATs, like AWS Managed NAT Gateways: Applications and services behind a Managed NAT Gateway can leverage peer relays to relay traffic that can’t establish direct connections.Relay through network firewalls: Workloads running in strictly firewalled environments can predictably expose a single UDP port, limiting the Tailscale surface area and fast-tracking the approval process for firewall exceptions.Offload from Custom and Managed DERP: Minimize data-in-transit through Tailscale‘s managed DERP network, and remove the need for customer-maintained DERP servers.Provide access to locked down customer networks: Data plane traffic can be relayed through predictable endpoints in customer networks, so that they only need to open minimal numbers of ports to facilitate cross network connections.Tailscale Peer Relays is available today as a public beta. We’ve yet to establish all the connectivity paths we want to, and there’s still visibility and debugging improvements to work through. However, we’ve reliably seen our early design partners move to peer relay deployments with relative ease, and we’re ready for you to give it a try on your tailnet.Tailscale Peer Relays can be enabled on all plans, including free (it’s our little way of working through the kinks of the modern internet with our customers). All customers can use two peer relays, for free, forever. As your needs scale, so will the number of available peer relays. To add even more peer relays to your tailnet, come have a chat with us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How AI labs use Mercor to get the data companies won’t share</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/how-ai-labs-use-mercor-to-get-the-data-companies-wont-share/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:18:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mercor CEO Brendan Foody has built a $10 billion empire freeing up valuable data from legacy industries and making it available to AI labs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Minecraft removing obfuscation in Java Edition</title><link>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition</link><author>SteveHawk27</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:12:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you like to mod Java, tinker with builds, or take deep dives into Minecraft’s code? Then this article is for you!  For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods. Minecraft: Java Edition has been obfuscated since its release. This obfuscation meant that people couldn’t see our source code. Instead, everything was scrambled – and those who wanted to mod Java Edition had to try and piece together what every class and function in the code did. But we encourage people to get creative both in Minecraft and with Minecraft – so in 2019 we tried to make this tedious process a little easier by releasing “obfuscation mappings”. These mappings were essentially a long list that allowed people to match the obfuscated terms to un-obfuscated terms. This alleviated the issue a little, as modders didn’t need to puzzle out what everything did, or what it should be called anymore. But why stop there?  Removing obfuscation in Java Edition To make things even easier – and remove these intermediary steps – we’re removing obfuscation altogether! Starting with the first snapshot following the complete Mounts of Mayhem launch, we will no longer obfuscate Minecraft: Java Edition. This means that this build (and all future builds) will have all of our original names* – now with variable names and other names – included by default to make modding even easier. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tell HN: Azure Outage</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45748799</link><author>kierenj</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:08:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Their pricing calculator, and main portal.azure.com is down - at least here in the UK.

On our benchmarks, the model achieves frontier coding results with generation speed four times faster than similar models.We achieve these results by training the model to complete real-world software engineering challenges in large codebases. During training, Composer is given access to a set of production search and editing tools and tasked with efficiently solving a diverse range of difficult problems. The final result is a large-scale model optimized for high-speed use as an agent in Cursor.Our motivation comes from our experience developing Cursor Tab, our custom completion model. We found that often developers want the smartest model that can support interactive use, keeping them in the flow of coding. In our development process, we experimented with a prototype agent model, codenamed Cheetah, to better understand the impact of faster agent models. Composer is a smarter version of this model that keeps coding delightful by being fast enough for an interactive experience.Composer is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model supporting long-context generation and understanding. It is specialized for software engineering through reinforcement learning (RL) in a diverse range of development environments. At each iteration of training, the model is given a problem description and instructed to produce the best response, be it a code edit, a plan, or an informative answer. The model has access to simple tools, like reading and editing files, and also more powerful ones like terminal commands and codebase-wide semantic search.To measure progress, we constructed an evaluation that measures a model's usefulness to a software developer as faithfully as possible. Our benchmark, Cursor Bench, consists of real agent requests from engineers and researchers at Cursor, along with hand-curated optimal solutions to these requests. The resulting evaluation measures not just the agent’s correctness, but also its adherence to a codebase's existing abstractions and software engineering practices.Reinforcement learning allows us to actively specialize the model for effective software engineering. Since response speed is a critical component for interactive development, we incentivize the model to make efficient choices in tool use and to maximize parallelism whenever possible. In addition, we train the model to be a helpful assistant by minimizing unnecessary responses and claims made without evidence. We also find that during RL, the model learns useful behaviors on its own like performing complex searches, fixing linter errors, and writing and executing unit tests.Efficient training of large MoE models requires significant investment into building infrastructure and systems research. We built custom training infrastructure leveraging PyTorch and Ray to power asynchronous reinforcement learning at scale. We natively train our models at low precision by combining our MXFP8 MoE kernels with expert parallelism and hybrid sharded data parallelism, allowing us to scale training to thousands of NVIDIA GPUs with minimal communication cost. Additionally, training with MXFP8 allows us to deliver faster inference speeds without requiring post-training quantization.During RL, we want our model to be able to call any tool in the Cursor Agent harness. These tools allow editing code, using semantic search, grepping strings, and running terminal commands. At our scale, teaching the model to effectively call these tools requires running hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud. To support this workload, we adapted existing infrastructure we built for Background Agents, rewriting our virtual machine scheduler to support the bursty nature and scale of training runs. This enabled seamless unification of RL environments with production environments.Cursor builds tools for software engineering, and we make heavy use of the tools we develop. A motivation of Composer development has been developing an agent we would reach for in our own work. In recent weeks, we have found that many of our colleagues were using Composer for their day-to-day software development. With this release, we hope that you also find it to be a valuable tool.¹ Benchmarked on an internal benchmark in the Cursor tool harness. We group models into classes based on score and report the best model in each class. "Fast Frontier" includes models designed for efficient inference such as Haiku 4.5 and Gemini Flash 2.5. "Best Open" includes recent open weight model releases such as Qwen Coder and GLM 4.6. "Frontier 7/2025" is the best model available in July of this year.  "Best Frontier" includes GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, which both outperform Composer. For the Tokens per Second calculation, tokens are standardized across models to the latest Anthropic tokenizer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why didn&apos;t this skateboard stunt start from the top?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tWRyiCP17do</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tWRyiCP17do?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:03:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the world's largest skateboard ramp from @redbull

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

The milestone comes a mere three months after Nvidia crossed the $4 trillion mark in July, vaulting the company past tech giants like Apple and Microsoft in market valuation but also driving continued fears of an AI investment bubble.Nvidia’s shares have climbed nearly 12-fold since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, as the AI boom propelled the S&P 500 to record highs.

During a Bloomberg Television interview at the event, Huang dismissed concerns about overheated valuations, saying, “I don’t believe we’re in an AI bubble. All of these different AI models we’re using—we’re using plenty of services and paying happily to do it.”Nvidia expects to ship 20 million units of its latest chips, compared to just 4 million units of the previous Hopper generation over its entire lifetime, Huang said at the conference.

Though widespread power outages across the island are hampering recovery efforts.Desmond McKenzie, the Jamaican Minister of Local Government said that “Jamaica’s gone through what I can call one of its worst periods.”He added: “Our infrastructure has been severely compromised. St Elizabeth is the breadbasket of the country, and that has taken a beating.”The parish of St Elizabeth in the south east is one of the worst-hit areas. The coastal district is described as being ‘under water’ by officials, with power lines leaning precariously over flooded, debris-filled streets – making access for responders difficult.The Jamaican capital of Kingston, in the east of the island, was spared the eye of the storm but has still suffered significant damage.The number of fatalities has not yet been released by the government, but “we are expecting that there would be some loss of life,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told CNN.Help is on the way with aid agencies and foreign governments on standby to support this nation of almost 3 million people, according to Richard Thompson from the Jamaican Disaster Preparedness co-ordinating Body, ODPEM.“We will have a lot of commitment coming from overseas,” he said.“We will have enough hands on board and a very well put together plan to ensure when supplies are in the country that they are not backing up at the ports.”But Melissa’s trail of destruction is not over yet.It was downgraded to a category 3 hurricane as it made landfall in Cuba on Wednesday morning. But it is still the strongest hurricane to hit the island since 2017 – with sustained wind speeds of 120mph.More than 700,000 Cubans were evacuated  and local authorities have declared a “state of alert” in six eastern provinces.Residents now fear what might unfold over the coming hours.“You’re looking at the sea as it is right now. We’ve had to move things from the house to higher ground. We’re sheltering the animals to prevent them from drowning in case the tide rises and the water comes in,” resident Reinaldo Montoya told reporters.Meanwhile, Cuba’s President appeared on state TV to warn people of the damage to come.“We want to stress again how big this event is and the need for people to understand the risk it poses because of its scale,” said President Migel Diaz-Canel.“We want to stress again how big this event is and the need for people to understand the risk it poses because of its scale,”– Cuban President Migel Diaz-Canel“These winds can destroy any facility that is not properly prepared. So we are once again asking everyone to use the time left before the hurricane arrives to move to safe areas to face this hurricane.”This hermit nation had already been experiencing a severe economic crisis with widespread food shortages and regular power outages, worsened by US sanctions and a lack of foreign currency.Soldiers have been deployed to the affected regions, but recovery from this storm will be made all the more challenging without the kind of outside help Jamaica will receive.Neighbouring Haiti is also experiencing the peripheral effects of Melissa, with heavy rainfall and flooding reported. Authorities ordered the closure of schools and businesses on Wednesday, while the UN said it will provide assistance in the coming days.The storm is now expected to lose power as it crosses towards Bermuda and the Bahamas before heading off into the Atlantic.And a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture meaning storms can produce heavier rainfall and flooding.Sea level rises are also making coastal communities more vulnerable to storm surges.The UN is again issuing warnings over climate change ahead of COP30 in Brazil next month. Only 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon despite being required to do so for the summit.Added together, these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C , a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change.While the UN does say progress in cutting carbon emissions over the next decade is being made, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target.For people in the Caribbean that could mean hurricanes more regularly as strong as Melissa, blighting the lives of residents and putting off visitors critical to their largely tourism based economies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The clever tactics that won the Battle of Britain #ww2 #worldwar2 #battleofbritain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hMGhn3CPTUY</link><author>WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hMGhn3CPTUY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:38:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSGFY2a_DYK8plQI_fcY_Xg">Podcast - WW2 Pod</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk

And you can even play LPC encoded audio on a 10 cent MCU.There’s quite a lot more detail in this video (and of course you can hear the audio!).In the previous project, I had this ultra-cheap CH32V003 microcontroller playing simple tunes on a tiny SMD buzzer. It was just toggling a GPIO pin at musical note frequencies – 1-bit audio output – and it sounded surprisingly decent. That was a fun start, but now it’s time to push this little $0.10 MCU even further: can we make it actually talk?Spoiler: Yes, we can! (well, there wouldn’t be much of a blog post if we couldn’t) This 8-pin RISC-V chip is now producing sampled audio data and spoken words. We’re really stretching the limits of what you can fit in 16 KB of flash.From Beeps to Actual AudioMoving from simple beeps to real audio meant using the microcontroller’s PWM output as a rudimentary DAC. Instead of just on/off beeping, I’m driving a waveform at an 8 kHz sample rate using a high-frequency PWM on the output pin. The hardware is the same tiny board as before
 – but I’ve swapped the small SMD buzzer for a small speaker. The buzer works too, but it’s quieter and very tinny.The sample I wanted to test with is just over 6 seconds in length - it’s the iconic “Open the pod bay doors HAL…” sequence from 2001.If we keep this audio at 16-bit PCM, 8kHZ, we’d need about 96KB – way beyond our 16 KB flash! And remember, that 16 KB has to hold both the audio data and our playback code. Clearly some aggressive compression is required.I considered a few encoding options for compressing the audio. Simply using 8-bit samples at 8 kHz cuts size in half (to ~47 KB for 6s), but that’s still about 3× too large for our flash. Adaptive Differential PCM is a simple lossy compression that could quarter the size. In theory 6 seconds would be ~24 KB – much closer to fitting, This is nice codec that packs audio into about 3.2 bits per sample (roughly 1/5 the size of 16-bit PCM) Going even further with ADPCM, using only 2 bits per sample gives a 4:1 compression relative to 8-bit audio – that’s 75% storage savings.2-bit ADPCM is definitely the winner here. Our 6-second clip shrinks to under 12 KB, which comfortably fits in flash with room for code. This looked like the winner, provided the audio quality was acceptable. The decoder for 2-bit ADPCM is also very lightweight (my implementation compiled to under just over 1K of code - 1340 bytes!). It’s definitely low quality - but it actually sounds surprisingly ok.How does 2-bit ADPCM work?It’s actually a very simple algorithm. Both the encoder and decoder maintain a predicted signal value and a step size index into a predefined table. Each 2-bit code tells the decoder how to adjust the current prediction and the step size index. In essence, we’re coding the difference between the real audio and our prediction, with only four possible levels (since 2 bits gives 4 values). After each sample, the algorithm adapts: if the prediction error was large, we move to a bigger step size (to allow larger changes); if the error was small, we use a smaller step size for finer resolution. This adaptive step is what makes it ADPCM (Adaptive Differential PCM).Our codes are as follows: (0): Go down by 1 step - subtract the step size from our current prediction (1): Go up by 1 step - add the step size to our current prediction (2): Go down by 2 steps - subtract the 2 x step size from our current prediction (3): Go up by 2 steps - add the 2 x step size to our current predictionEven with this very high level of compression, the predicted waveform manages to track the original audio surprisingly well. The above graph shows a small snippet of the audio: the blue line is the original waveform and the yellow line is the ADPCM decoder’s output.They’re not identical (and we wouldn’t expect them to be), but the general shape is preserved. When you play it back through the little speaker, it’s recognizable and surprisingly good.To make my life easier, I built a quick conversion tool to encode WAV files into this 2-bit ADPCM format. The tool lets me drag-and-drop a WAV, and it gives you the files with the data that can ve dropped into the firmware code.Six seconds of audio is cool, but what about longer phrases or even arbitrary speech? Storing anything much longer with raw or ADPCM audio would quickly fill the 16K of flash.For my second experiment, I tried something different: instead of recorded waveform audio, I used an old-school speech synthesis approach. This leverages the fact that spoken language can be encoded very compactly by modeling the human voice, rather than storing the raw sound. Specifically, I integrated a library called Talkie.Talkie is a software implementation of the Texas Instruments LPC speech synthesis architecture from the late 1970s. This was implemented in a variety of chips, most commonly the TMS5220 and TMS5100 speech chips.These were used in things like the original Speak & Spell, arcade games like early Star Wars, and speech add-ons for home computers (e.g. the BBC Micro).The Talkie library (originally by Peter Knight, later added to by Adafruit) comes with a big set of examples and vocabulary. It’s also possible to extract examples from old ROMs from arcade games.Each phrase or word only takes a few hundred bytes or even less, so you can fit quite a lot of speech into a few kilobytes of flash. The trade-off is that the voice has a very computer-esque timbre – think of the Speak & Spell’s voice. It’s clearly synthetic, but still understandable.To say custom sentences not in the library, you either concatenate the available words/phonemes (which can be clunky), or you need to generate new LPC data. The original tools for this are a bit obscure – there’s BlueWizard (a classic Mac app) and PythonWizard (a command-line tool with TK GUI) which can analyze WAV files and produce LPC data.I gave both a try with some success (and a few headaches setting them up). In the end, I cheated a bit and used an AI coding assistant to help me create a streamlined online tool for this.The result is a little web app where I can upload a recording of, say, my own voice, and it outputs the LPC data. It even lets me play back the synthesized voice in-browser to check it.So there we have it – our 10¢ microcontroller now has a voice! By using 2-bit ADPCM compression, we can store short audio clips (up to around 8 seconds) even in 16 KB of flash, and play them back via PWM with decent fidelity.And with the Talkie LPC speech synthesis, we can make the device “speak” lots of words and phrases with only a tiny memory footprint.If you want to hear it for yourself, check out the video demo linked at the top of this post. In the video, you’ll see (and hear) the WarGames clip and the Star Wars quotes running on the hardware. It’s honestly amazing what these cheap little MCUs can do. We’re really pushing the boundaries of cheap hardware here.You can find all my code on GitHub in this repository.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kafka is Fast – I&apos;ll use Postgres</title><link>https://topicpartition.io/blog/postgres-pubsub-queue-benchmarks</link><author>enether</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:06:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel like the tech world lives in two camps.One camp chases buzzwords.This camp tends to adopt whatever’s popular without thinking hard about whether it’s appropriate. They tend to fall for all the purported benefits the sales pitch gives them - real-time, infinitely scale, cutting-edge, cloud-native, serverless, zero-trust, AI-powered, etc.You see this everywhere in the Kafka world: Streaming Lakehouse™️, Kappa™️ Architecture, Streaming AI Agents.This phenomenon is sometimes known as . Modern practices actively encourage this. Consultants push “innovative architectures” stuffed with vendor tech via “insight” reports. System design interviews expect you to design Google-scale architectures that are inevitably at a scale 100x higher than the company you’re interviewing for would ever need. Career progression rewards you for replatforming to the Hot New Stack™️, not for being resourceful.The other camp chases common senseThis camp is far more pragmatic. They strip away unnecessary complexity and steer clear of overengineered solutions. They reason from first principles before making technology choices. They resist marketing hype and approach vendor claims with healthy skepticism.Historically, it has felt like Camp 1 definitively held the upper hand in sheer numbers and noise. Today, it feels like the pendulum may be beginning to swing back, at least a tiny bit. Two recent trends are on the side of Camp 2:Trend 1 - the “Small Data” movement. People are realizing two things - their data isn’t that big and their computers are becoming big too. You can rent a 128-core, 4 TB of RAM instance from AWS. AMD just released 192-core CPUs this summer. That ought to be enough for anybody.Trend 2 - the Postgres Renaissance. The space is seeing incredible growth and investment. In the last 2 years, the phrase “Just Use Postgres (for everything)” has gained a ton of popularity. The basic premise is that you shouldn’t complicate things with new tech when you don’t need to, and that Postgres alone solves most problems pretty well. Postgres competes with purpose-built solutions like:Elasticsearch (functionality supported by Postgres’ /)Redis ()AI Vector Databases (, )Snowflake (, )The claim isn’t that Postgres is functionally equivalent to any of these specialized systems. The claim is that it handles 80%+ of their use cases with 20% of the development effort. (Pareto Principle)When you combine the two trends, the appeal becomes obvious. Postgres is a battle-tested, well-known system that is simple, scalable and reliable. Pair it with today’s powerful hardware and you quickly begin to realize that, more often than not, you do not need the state-of-the-art highly optimized and complex distributed system in order to handle your organization’s scale.A 500 KB/s workload should not use Kafka. There is a scalability cargo cult in tech that always wants to choose “the best possible” tech for a problem - but this misses the forest for the trees. The “best possible” solution frequently isn’t a technical question - it’s a practical one. Adriano makes an airtight case for why you should opt for  in his PG as Queue blog (2023) that originally inspired me to write this.Enough background. In this article, we will do three simple things:I am not aiming for an exhaustive in-depth evaluation. Benchmarks are messy af. Rather, my goal is to publish some reasonable data points which can start a discussion.(while this article is for Postgres, feel free to replace it with your database of choice)If you’d like to skip straight to the results, here they are:There are dozens of blogs out there using Postgres as a , but interestingly enough I haven’t seen one use it as a pub-sub messaging system.A quick distinction between the two because I often see them get confused: are meant for point-to-point communication. They’re widely used for asynchronous background jobs: worker apps (clients) process a task in the queue like sending an e-mail or pushing a notification. The event is consumed once and it’s done with. A message is immediately deleted (popped) off the queue once it’s consumed. Queues do not have strict ordering guarantees. messaging differs from the queue in that it is meant for one-to-many communication. This inherently means there is a large read fanout - more than one reader client is interested in any given message. Good pub-sub systems decouple readers from writers by storing data on disks. This allows them to not impose a max queue depth limit - something in-memory queues need to do in order to prevent them from going OOM.There is also a general expectation that there is strict order - events should be read in the same order that they arrived in the system.Postgres’ main competitor here is Kafka, which is the standard in pub-sub today. Various (mostly-proprietary) alternatives exist.Kafka uses the Log data structure to hold messages. You’ll see my benchmark basically reconstructs a log from Postgres primitives.Postgres doesn’t seem to have any popular libraries for pub-sub use cases, so I had to write my own. The Kafka-inspired workflow I opted for is this:Writers produce batches of messages per statement (). Each transaction carries one batch insert and targets a single  tableEach writer is sticky to one table, but in aggregate they produce to multiple tables.Each message has a unique monotonically-increasing offset number. A specific row in a special  table denotes the latest offset for a given  table.Write transactions atomically update both the  data and the  row. This ensures consistent offset tracking across concurrent writers.Readers poll for new messages. They consume the  table(s) sequentially, starting from the lowest offset and progressively reading up.Readers are split into consumer groups. Each group performs separate, independent reads and makes progress on the  tables.Each group contains 1 reader per  table.Readers store their progress in a  table, with a row for each  pair.Each reader updates the latest processed offset (claiming the records), selects the records and processes them inside a single transaction.This ensures Kafka-like semantics - gapless, monotonically-increasing offsets and at-least-once/at-most-once processing. This test in particular uses at-least-once semantics, but neither choice should impact the benchmark results.The benchmark runs  writer goroutines. These represent writer clients.
Each one loops and atomically inserts  records while updating the latest offset:The benchmark also runs  reader goroutines. Each reader is assigned a particular consumer group and partition. The group as a whole reads all partitions while each reader in the group reads only one partition at a time.The reader loops, opens a transaction, optimistically claims  records (by advancing the offset mark beyond them), selects them and processes the records.
If successful, it commits the transaction and through that advances the offset for the group.It is a pull-based read (just like Kafka), rather than push-based. If the reader has no records to poll, it sleeps for a bit.First it opens a transaction:Then it claims the offsets:Followed by selecting the claimed records:Finally, the data gets processed by the business logic (no-op in our benchmark) and the transaction is closed:If you’re wondering  - my understanding of that feature is that it’s an optimization and cannot be fully relied upon, so polling is required either way. Given that, I just copied Kafka’s relatively simple design.The full code and detailed results are all published on GitHub at stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark.
I ran three setups - a single-node 4 vCPU, a 3-node replicated 4 vCPU and a single-node 96 vCPU setup. Here are the summarized results for each:c7i.xlarge Postgres server /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volumemostly default Postgres settings (synchronous commit, fsync);

It’s funny to think that the majority of people run a complex distributed system like Kafka for similar workloads.Now, a replicated setup to more accurately mimic the durability and availability guarantees of Kafka.3x c7i.xlarge Postgres servers /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume

Throughput was not impacted at all. Latency increased but not extremely. Our p99 e2e latency 3x’d (60ms vs 185ms), but the p95 barely moved from 10.6ms to 12ms.This shows that a simple 3-node Postgres cluster can pretty easily sustain what is a very common Kafka workload - 5 MB/s ingest and 25 MB/s egress. Not only that, but for a cheap cost too. Just $11,514 per year.Typically, you’d expect Postgres to run more expensive than Kafka at a certain scale, simply because it wasn’t designed to be efficient for this use case.
Not here though. Running Kafka yourself would cost the same. Running the same workload through a Kafka vendor will cost you at least $50,000 a year. 🤯By the way, in Kafka it’s customary to apply client-side compression on your data. If we assume your messages were 5 KB in size and your clients applied a pretty regular compression ratio of 4x - Postgres is actually handling 20 MB/s ingress and 100 MB/s egress.Ok, let’s see how far Postgres will go.c7i.24xlarge (96 vCPU, 192 GiB RAM) Postgres server instance /w 250GB io2 12,000 IOPS EBS volumemodified Postgres settings ( on, other settings scaled to match the machine);
still kept fsync & synchronous_commit on for durability.autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05 set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)100 writers (~3.33 writers per partition on average)5x read fanout via 5 consumer groups150 reader clients total (5 readers per group)write batch size: 200 recordsread batch size: 200 recordswrite message rate: write throughput: write latency: 138ms p99 / 47ms p95read message rate: read message throughput: end-to-end latency:  / 242ms p95 / 23.4ms p50server kept at  CPU (basically idle);bottleneck: The bottleneck was the write rate per partition. It seems like the test wasn’t able to write at a higher rate than 8 MiB/s (8k msg/s) per table with this design. I didn’t push further, but I do wonder now as I write this - how far would writes have scaled?Reads were trivial to scale. Adding more consumer groups was trivial - I tried with 10x fanout and still ran at low CPU. I didn’t include it because I didn’t feel the need to push to an unrealistic read-fanout extreme.240 MiB/s ingress and 1.16 GiB/s egress are pretty good! The 96 vCPU machine was overkill for this test - it could have done a lot more, or we could have simply opted for a smaller machine. For what it’s worth, I do think it’s worth it to deploy a separate Kafka cluster at this scale. Kafka can save you a lot of money here because it can be more efficient in how it handles cross-zone network traffic with features like Diskless Kafka.These tests seem to show that Postgres is pretty competitive with Kafka at low scale.You may have noticed none of these tests were particularly long-running. From my understanding, the value in longer-running tests is to test table vacuuming in Postgres, as that can have negative performance effects. In the pub-sub section, vacuuming doesn’t apply because the tables are append-only. My other reasoning for running shorter tests was to keep costs in check and not spend too much time.In any case, no benchmark is perfect. My goal wasn’t to indisputably prove . Rather, I want to start a discussion by showing that what’s possible is likely larger than what most people assume. I certainly didn’t assume I’d get such good numbers, especially with the pub-sub part.In Postgres, a queue can be implemented with SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED. This command selects an unlocked row and locks it. It also skips reading already-locked rows. That’s how mutual exclusion is achieved - a worker can’t get other workers’ jobs.Postgres has a very popular pgmq library that offers a slick queue API. To keep it simple and understand the end-to-end flow better, I decided to write my own queue. The basic version of it is very easy. My workflow is:lock row & take job (SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)process job ()mark job as “done” ( a field or  the row into a separate table)Postgres competes with RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, NATS, Redis and to an extent Kafka here.We use a simple  table. When an element is processed off the queue, it’s moved into the archive table.We again run  writer client goroutines.
Each one simply loops and sequentially inserts a single random item into the table:It only inserts one message per statement, which is pretty inefficient at scale.We again run  reader client goroutines. Each reader loops and processes one message.
The processing is done inside a database transaction.Each reader again only works with one message at a time per transaction.I again ran the same three setups - a single-node 4 vCPU, a 3-node replicated 4 vCPU and a single-node 96 vCPU setup. Here are the summarized results for each:The results are the average of two 15-minute tests. I also ran three 2-minute tests. They all performed similarly.c7i.xlarge Postgres server /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volumeall default Postgres settingseach row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)10 writer clients, 15 reader clientswrite latency: 2.46ms p99end-to-end latency: 17.72ms p99What I found Postgres wasn’t good at was handling client count. The bottleneck in this setup was the read clients. Each client could not read more than ~192 messages a second because of its median read latency and sequential read nature.Increasing client count boosted throughput but violated my ~60% CPU target. Trying to run 50 write and 50 read clients got to 4000 msg/s without increasing the queue depth but pegged the server’s CPU to 100%. I wanted to keep the benchmarks realistic for what you may run in production, rather than maxing out what a machine can do. This would be easily alleviated with a connection pooler (standard across all prod PG deployments) or a larger machine.Another thing worth mentioning is that the workload could sustain a lot more writes than reads. If I didn’t throttle the benchmark, it would write at 12,000 msg/s and read at 2,800 msg/s. In the spirit of simplicity, I didn’t debug further and instead throttled my writes to see at what point I could get a stable 1:1 workload.3x c7i.xlarge Postgres servers /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume

But not that much. It’s still over 2000 messages a second, which is pretty good for an HA queue!c7i.24xlarge Postgres server instance /w 250GB io2 12,000 IOPS EBS volumemodified Postgres settings ( on, other settings scaled to match the machine);

There is some bottleneck in the single-table queue approach at this scale which I didn’t bother figuring out. I figured that it wasn’t important to reach absurd numbers on a single table, since all realistic scenarios would have multiple queues and never reach 20,000 msg/s on a single one. The 96 vCPU instance would likely scale far further were we to run a few separate queue tables in parallel.Even a modest Postgres node can durably push thousands of queue ops/sec, which already covers the scale 99% of companies ever hit with a single queue.
As I said earlier, the last 2 years have seen the Just Use Postgres slogan become mainstream. The library’s star history captures this trend perfectly:
Most of the time - . You should always default to Postgres until the constraints prove you wrong.Kafka is obviously better optimized for pub-sub workloads. Queue systems are obviously better optimized for queue workloads. The point is that picking a technology based on technical optimization alone is a flawed approach. To throw an analogy:a Formula One car is optimized to drive faster, but I still use a sedan to go to work. I am way more comfortable driving my sedan than an F1 car.The Postgres sedan comes with many quality-of-life comforts that the F1 Kafka does not:ability to debug messages with regular SQLability to delete, re-order or edit messages in placeability to join pub-sub data with regular tablesability to trivially read specific data via rich SQL queries (, , )Giving up these comforts is a justified sacrifice for your F1 car to go at 378 kmh (235 mph), but masochistic if you plan on driving at 25kmh (15 mph).Donald Knuth warned us in 1974 -  is the root of all evil. Deploying Kafka at small scale is premature optimization.
The point of this article is to show you that this “small scale” number has grown further than what people remember it to be - it can comfortably mean many megabytes per second.We are in a Postgres Renaissance for a reason: Postgres is  good enough. Modern NVMEs and cheap RAM allow it to scale absurdly high.Custom Solutions for Everything?Naive engineers tend to adopt a specialized technology at the slightest hint of a need: Redis, of course! Let’s deploy Elasticsearch! BigQuery or Snowflake - that’s what our data analysts used at their last job. We need a NoSQL database like MongoDB.Have to crunch some numbers on S3? Let’s use Spark!A good engineer thinks through the bigger picture.Does this new technology move the needle?Is shaving a few milliseconds off our query worth the extra organizational complexity introduced with the change?At small scale, these systems hurt you more than they benefit you. Distributed systems - both in terms of node count and system cardinality - should be respected, feared, avoided and employed only as a weapon of last resort against particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system becomes more challenging and time-consuming.The problem is the organizational overhead. The organizational overhead of adopting a new system, learning its nuances, configs, establishing monitoring, establishing processes around deployments and upgrades, attaining operational expertise on how to manage it, creating runbooks, testing it, debugging it, adopting its clients and API, using its UI, keeping up with its ecosystem, etc.All of these are real organizational costs that can take months to get right, even if the system in question isn’t difficult (a lot are). Managed SaaS offerings trade off some of the organizational overhead for greater financial costs - but they still don’t remove it all. And until you reach the scale where the technology is necessary, you pay these extra {financial, organizational} costs for zero significant gain.If the same can be done with tech for which you’ve already paid the organizational costs for (e.g Postgres), adopting something else prematurely is most definitely an anti-pattern. You don’t need web-scale technologies when you don’t have web-scale problems.MVI (a better alternative)What I think is a better approach is to search for the minimum viable infrastructure (MVI): build the smallest amount of system while still providing value.choose  technology your org is already  with
 == meets your users’ needs without being too slow/expensive/insecure == your org has prior experience, has runbooks/ops setups, monitoring, UI, etcsolve a real problem with ituse the minimum set of features
the fewer features you use, the more flexibility you have to move off the infra in question in the future (e.g if locked in with a vendor)Bonus points if that technology:is widely adopted so finding good engineers for it is trivial (Postgres - check)has a strong and growing network effect (Postgres - check)The MVI approach reduces the surface area of your infra. The fewer moving parts you have, the fewer failure modes you worry about and the less glue code you have to maintain.Unfortunately, it’s human nature to go against this. Just like startups suffer due to MVP bloat , infra teams suffer due to MVI bloat I won’t pretend to be able to map out the exact path-dependent outcome, but my guess is this:the zero interest rate era gave us abundant speculative money that was invested in any company that could grow fasta lot of viral internet companies were growing at speeds that led old infra to become obsolete fastthis prompted the next wave of ZIRP investment - specialized data infrastructure companies (in a gold rush, sell shovels!); some of these data infra startups spun off directly from the high-growth companies themselveseach well-funded data infra vendor is financially motivated to evangelize their product and have you adopt it even when you don’t need to (Everyone is Talking Their Book). They had deep pockets for marketing and used them.innovative infrastructure software got engineered. It was exciting - so engineers got nerd-sniped into ita web-scale craze/cargo cult developed, where everybody believed they need to be able to scale from zero to millions of RPS because they may go viral any day.a trend developed to copy whatever solutions the most successful, largest digital-native companies were using (Amazon, Google, Uber, etc.)the trend became a self-perpetuating prophecy: these technologies became a sought-after skill on resumes
system design interview questions were adapted to test for knowledge of these systemswithin an organization, engineers (knowingly or not) pushed for projects that are exciting and helped build their resumes;This trend continues to grow while there is no strong competing force that is sufficiently motivated to push the opposite view. Even engineers inside a company, who ought to be motivated to keep things simple, have strong incentives to pursue extra complexity. It benefits their career by giving them a project to use as ammo for their next promotion and improves their resume (cool tech/story on there) for their next job-hop. Plus it’s simply more fun.This is why I think we, as an industry, don’t always use the simplest solution available.In most cases, Postgres is that simplest solution that is available.I want to wrap this article up, but one rebuttal I can’t miss addressing is the “it won’t scale argument”.The argument goes something like this: “in today’s age we can go viral at a moment’s notice; these viral moments are very valuable for our business so we need to aggressively design in a way that keeps our app stable under traffic spikes”I have three arguments against this:Bohan Zhang, a member of OpenAI’s infrastructure team and co-founder of OtterTune (a Postgres tuning service), can be quoted as saying:“At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.”“The main message of my talk was that if you are not too write heavy, you can scale Postgres to a very high read throughput with read replicas using only a single master! That is exactly the message that needs to be spelled out as that covers  of apps.”“Postgres is probably the default choice for developers right now. You can use Postgres for a very long time. If you are building a startup with read-heavy workloads, just start with Postgres. If you hit a scalability issue, increase the instance size. You can scale it to a very large scale. If in the future the database becomes a bottleneck, congratulations. You have built a successful startup. It’s a good problem to have.”(slightly edited for clarity and grammar)Despite their rapid growth to a user base of more than 800 million, OpenAI has still NOT opted for a web-scale distributed database. If they haven’t… why does your unproven project need to?2. You Have More Time To Scale Than You ThinkLet’s say it’s a good principle to design/test for ~10x your scale. Here are the years of  growth rate it takes to get to 10x your current scale:It goes to show that even at extreme growth levels, you still have years to migrate between solutions.
The majority of developers, though, work at companies in the 0-50% growth rate. They are more likely to have moved on to another job by the time the solution needs to change (if ever).In an ideal world, you  build for scale and any other future problem you may hit in 10 years.In the real world, you have finite bandwidth, so you have to build for the most immediate, highest ROI problem.Planning your infrastructure around being able to handle that is sort of like buying a huge Marshall stack as your first guitar amp because your garage band might get invited to open for Coldplay.Just use Postgres until it breaks.I’m a complete Postgres noob. You may see a lot of dumb mistakes here. Feel free to call me out on them - I’m happy to learn. I used AI to help a lot with some of the PG tools to use. This both shows how inexperienced I am in the context and how easy it is to start. I am generally skeptical of AI’s promise (in the short-term), but there’s no denying it has made a large dent in democratizing niche/low-level knowledge.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the U.A.E.

It’s hard to overstate the reliance that entire industries have on three TEEs in particular: Confidential Compute from Nvidia, SEV-SNP from AMD, and SGX and TDX from Intel. All three come with assurances that confidential data and sensitive computing can’t be viewed or altered, even if a server has suffered a complete compromise of the operating kernel.A trio of novel physical attacks raises new questions about the true security offered by these TEES and the exaggerated promises and misconceptions coming from the big and small players using them.The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From VS Code to Helix</title><link>https://ergaster.org/posts/2025/10/29-vscode-to-helix/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:19:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I created the website you’re reading with VS Code. Behind the scenes I use Astro, a static site generator that gets out of the way while providing nice conveniences.Using VS Code was a no-brainer: everyone in the industry seems to at least be familiar with it, every project can be opened with it, and most projects can get enhancements and syntactic helpers in a few clicks. In short: VS Code is free, easy to use, and widely adopted.A Rustacean colleague kept singing Helix’s praises. I discarded it because he’s much smarter than I am, and I only ever use vim when I need to fiddle with files on a server. I like when things “Just Work” and didn’t want to bother learning how to use Helix nor how to configure it.Today it has become my daily driver. Why did I change my mind? What was preventing me from using it before? And how difficult was it to get there?Automation and technology make work easier, this is why we produce technology in the first place. But it also means you grow more dependent on the tech you use. If the tech is produced transparently by an international team or a team you trust, it’s fine. But if it’s produced by a single large entity that can screw you over, it’s dangerous.VS Code might be open source, but in practice it’s produced by Microsoft. Microsoft has a problematic relationship to consent and is shoving AI products down everyone’s throat. I’d rather use tools that respect me and my decisions, and I’d rather not get my tools produced by already monopolistic organizations.Microsoft is also based in the USA, and the political climate over there makes me want to depend as little as possible on American tools. I know that’s a long, uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere.I’m not advocating for a ban against American tech in general, but for more balance in our supply chain. I’m also not advocating for European tech either: I’d rather get open source tools from international teams competing in a race to the top, rather than from teams in a single jurisdiction. What is happening in the USA could happen in Europe too.I’ve never found vim particularly pleasant to use but it’s everywhere, so I figured I might just get used to it. But one of the things I never liked about vim is the number of moving pieces. By default, vim and neovim are very bare bones. They can be extended and completely modified with plugins, but I really don’t like the idea of having extremely customize tools.I’d rather have the same editor as everyone else, with a few knobs for minor preferences. I am subject to choice paralysis, so making me configure an editor before I’ve even started editing is the best way to tank my productivity.When my colleague told me about Helix, two things struck me as improvements over vim.Helix’s philosophy is that everything should work out of the box. There are a few configs and themes, but everything should work similarly from one Helix to another. All the language-specific logic is handled in Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol standard.In Helix, first you select text, and then you perform operations onto it. So you can visually tell what is going to be changed before you apply the change. It fits my mental model much better.But there are major drawbacks to Helix too:After decades of vim, I was scared to re-learn everything. In practice this wasn’t a problem at all because of the very visual way Helix works.VS Code “Just Works”, and Helix sounded like more work than the few clicks from VS Code’s extension store. This is true, but not as bad as I had anticipated.After a single week of usage, Helix was already very comfortable to navigate. After a few weeks, most of the wrinkles have been ironed out and I use it as my primary editor. So how did I overcome those fears? It can sound silly, but the very first step to get into Helix was not to overthink it. I just installed it on my mac with  and gave it a go. I was not too familiar with it, so I looked up the official documentation and noticed there was a tutorial.This tutorial alone is what convinced me to try harder. It’s an interactive and well written way to learn how to move and perform basic operations in Helix. I quickly learned how to move around, select things, surround them with braces or parenthesis. I could  what I was about to do before doing it. This has been epiphany. Helix just worked the way I wanted.Better: I could get things done faster than in VS Code after a few minutes of learning. Being a lazy person, I never bothered looking up VS Code shortcuts. Because the learning curve for Helix is slightly steeper, you  to learn those shortcuts that make moving around feel so easy.Not only did I quickly get used to Helix key bindings: my vim muscle-memory didn’t get in the way at all!The built-in tutorial is a very pragmatic way to get started. You get results fast, you learn hands on, and it’s not that long. But if you want to go further, you have to look for docs. Helix has officials docs. They seem to be fairly complete, but they’re also impenetrable as a new user. They focus on what the editor supports and not on what I will want to do with it.After a bit of browsing online, I’ve stumbled upon this third-party documentation website. The domain didn’t inspire me a lot of confidence, but the docs are really good. They are clearly laid out, use-case oriented, and they make the most of Astro Starlight to provide a great reading experience. The author tried to upstream these docs, but that won’t happen. It looks like they are upstreaming their docs to the current website. I hope this will improve the quality of upstream docs eventually.After learning the basics and finding my way through the docs, it was time to ensure Helix was set up to help me where I needed it most.In my free time, I mostly use my editor for three things:Tweak my website with AstroEdit yaml to faff around my Kubernetes clusterHelix is a “stupid” text editor. It doesn’t know much about what you’re typing. But it supports Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol. Language Servers understand the document you’re editing. They explain to Helix what you’re editing, whether you’re in a TypeScript function, typing a markdown link, etc. With that information, Helix and the Language Server can provide code completion hints, errors & warnings, and easier navigation in your code.In addition to Language Servers, Helix also supports plugging code formatters. Those are pieces of software that will read the document and ensure that it is consistently formatted. It will check that all indentations use spaces and not tabs, that there is a consistent number of space when indenting, that brackets are on the same line as the function, etc. In short: it will make the code pretty.Markdown is not really a programming language, so it might seem surprising to configure a Language Server for it. But if you remember what we said earlier, Language Servers can provide code completion, which is useful when creating links for example. Marksman does exactly that!We can check that Helix is happy with it with the following commandBut Language Servers can also help Helix display errors and warnings, and “code suggestions” to help fix the issues. It means Language Servers are a perfect fit for… grammar checkers! Several grammar checkers exist. The most notable are:LTEX+, the Language Server used by Language Tool. It supports several languages must is quite resource hungry.Harper, a grammar checker Language Server developed by Automattic, the people behind WordPress, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Beeper and more. Harper only support English and its variants, but they intend to support more languages in the future.I mostly write in English and want to keep a minimalistic setup. Automattic is well funded, and I’m confident they will keep working on Harper to improve it. Since grammar checker LSPs can easily be changed, I’ve decided to go with Harper for now.To install it, homebrew does the job as always:Then I edited my ~/.config/helix/languages.toml to add Harper as a secondary Language Server in addition to marksmanFinally I can add a markdown linter to ensure my markdown is formatted properly. Several options exist, and markdownlint is one of the most popular. My colleagues recommended the new kid on the block, a  equivalent: rumdl.Installing rumdl was pretty simple on my mac. I only had to add the repository of the maintainer, and install rumdl from it.After that I added a new  to my ~/.config/helix/languages.toml and added it to the language servers to use for the markdown .Since my website already contained a  I could import it to the rumdl format withYou might have noticed that I’ve added a little quality of life improvement: soft-wrap at 80 characters.Now if you add this to your own  you will notice that the text is completely left aligned. This is not a problem on small screens, but it rapidly gets annoying on wider screens.Helix doesn’t support centering the editor. There is a PR tackling the problem but it has been stale for most of the year. The maintainers are overwhelmed by the number of PRs making it their way, and it’s not clear if or when this PR will be merged.In the meantime, a workaround exists, with a few caveats. It is possible to add spaces to the left gutter (the column with the line numbers) so it pushes the content towards the center of the screen.To figure out how many spaces are needed, you need to get your terminal width with In my case, when in full screen, my terminal is 243 characters wide. I need to remove the content column with from it, and divide everything by 2 to get the space needed on each side. In my case for a 243 character wide terminal with a text width of 80 characters:As is, I would add 203 spaces to my left gutter to push the rest of the gutter and the content to the right. But the gutter itself has a width of 4 characters, that I need to remove from the total. So I need to subtract them from the total, which leaves me with  characters to add.I can open my ~/.config/helix/config.toml to add a new key binding that will automatically add or remove those spaces from the left gutter when needed, to shift the content towards the center.Now when in normal mode, pressing  then  then  will add/remove the spaces. Of course this workaround only works when the terminal runs in full screen mode.I only had to install those globally withNow we need to add a few lines to our ~/.config/helix/languages.toml to tell it how to use the language serverWe can check that the Astro Language Server can be used by helix withI also like to get a formatter to automatically make my code consistent and pretty for me when I save a file. One of the most popular code formaters out there is Prettier. I’ve decided to go with the fast and easy formatter dprint instead.Then in the projects I want to use dprint in, I doI might edit the  file to my liking. Finally, I configure Helix to use dprint globally for all Astro projects by appending a few lines in my ~/.config/helix/languages.toml.One final check, and I can see that Helix is ready to use the formatter as wellFor yaml, it’s simple and straightforward: Helix is preconfigured to use  as soon as it’s in the PATH. I just need to install it withHelix really grew on me. I find it particularly easy and fast to edit code with it. It takes a tiny bit more work to get the language support than it does in VS Code, but it’s nothing insurmountable. There is a slightly steeper learning curve than for VS Code, but I consider it to be a good thing. It forced me to learn how to move around and edit efficiently, because there is no way to do it inefficiently. Helix remains intuitive once you’ve learned the basics.I am a GNOME enthusiast, and I adhere to the same principles: I like when my apps work out of the box, and when I have little to do to configure them. This is a strong stance that often attracts a vocal opposition. I like products that follow those principles better than those who don’t.With that said, Helix sometimes feels like it is maintained by one or two people who have a strong vision, but who struggle to onboard more maintainers. As of writing, Helix has more than 350 PRs open. Quite a few bring interesting features, but the maintainers don’t have enough time to review them.Those 350 PRs mean there is a lot of energy and goodwill around the project. People are willing to contribute. Right now, all that energy is gated, resulting in frustration both from the contributors who feel like they’re working in the void, and the maintainers who feel like there at the receiving end of a fire hose.A solution to make everyone happier without sacrificing the quality of the project would be to work on a Contributor Ladder. CHAOSS’ Dr Dawn Foster published a blog post about it, listing interesting resources at the end.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta&apos;s Ray-Ban Glasses Users Film and Harass Massage Parlor Workers</title><link>https://www.404media.co/metas-ray-ban-glasses-users-film-and-harass-massage-parlor-workers/</link><author>Emanuel Maiberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/photo-1640724063715-b0e9316c9639.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:11:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A number of Instagram accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers and millions of views have uploaded videos filmed with Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses show men entering massage parlors across the country and soliciting the workers there for “tuggy” massages, or sex work.

And for Comcast, the decision is deeply personal. Trump has frequently attacked Roberts and his news outlets, publicly calling him a “lowlife” and mocking the corporation as “Concast.” The insults have continued even after the conglomerate spun off its cable networks, including the Trump-loathed MSNBC and business-focused CNBC.”“On and  in recent days, anchors have taken pains to note—sometimes with audible discomfort—that their corporate parent, , is among the donors helping bankroll Trump’s ballroom. The move has left the network’s journalists in the awkward position of covering the story of their own company’s complicity. For Comcast and its chairman and chief executive, , it marks a moment of corporate humiliation, being publicly shamed on his own air for deference to Trump, the same vengeful president who has repeatedly targeted Roberts by name.”While Comcast may have suffered through a few barbs and fake FCC investigations, most of the news coverage oddly doesn’t mention the massive benefits from the second Trump administration.In addition to a surge in taxpayer subsidies and tax breaks, the Trump administration has destroyed the what remained of functional U.S. federal corporate oversight. They’ve demolished not just net neutrality but the entirety of FCC and FTC autonomy. That means little to no competent regulatory oversight of a company with a multi-decade history of extremely dodgy, anti-competitive, anti-consumer behavior. The Trump assault on the regulatory state and courts has made it effectively impossible to hold corporations like AT&T and Comcast accountable for literally anything (see: AT&T’s spying on wireless subscribers). How much is the complete destruction of the federal regulatory state worth over the next few decades? Probably significantly more than the millions Comcast is throwing at the ballroom. The question for the pathetic simps at Comcast is: how high will the longer-term costs of capitulating with authoritarians be? These are bizarre, erratic zealots, whose often incoherent demands shift on a dime. And in countries like Russia, where this sort of oligarch autocratic fusion has been allowed to fester, it generally doesn’t end well for industry leaders who wander too close to windows. We may not be quite there yet, but we’re on the path. The level of corruption and influence peddling we’re seeing now makes the last three decades of U.S. history look positively quaint by comparison. And the speed with which the abject cowards in the U.S. business community have fecklessly capitulated to the idiotic whims of mad tyrants isn’t something anybody’s likely to forget anytime soon.That said, it’s not exactly a surprise for me (somebody who has covered Comcast professionally for two decades) that when push came to shove, Comcast corporation wound up being a soulless ass kisser.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can these unusual underwater pyramids help save the ocean? #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wcgY6pXSxmw</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wcgY6pXSxmw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 12:02:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A critical food source in southwestern Madagascar is quickly disappearing.

But the margins with centre-right and left-wing parties have narrowed considerably.Earlier this week, Wilders was forced to issue a rare apology after two of his MPs were found to have distributed flyers featuring AI-generated images of the leader of the Green-Left party, former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans, apparently being arrested.These two figures – Wilders and Timmermans – have become the dominant names in Dutch politics, battling it out in tit-for-tat debates in parliament, on social media and in TV studios.While Wilders apologised for the AI pictures, Timmermans has refused to condemn a pro-Palestinian group which accused Wilders and other politicians on the right of backing genocide.In one of the final pre-election debates this week, Timmermans doubled down.“You’re defending [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] while he destroyed Gaza,” he said.“With that, you do condone genocide.”And it now appears that some Dutch voters have tired of the constant mudslinging, as a third ‘clean’ candidate from the centre-right – Henri Bontenbal – has emerged in the last month or so. But the Christian Democrat leader’s star may have already waned, after he made an apparent homophobic gaffe last week.Another party leader who has been forced to apologise.Geert Wilders’ strategy appears to be to return to the ground he knows best, using thinly-veiled, anti-foreigner, anti-Muslim rhetoric.
His election slogan is aimed at his core supporters: ‘This is your country!’.Immigration continues to be a touchstone issue for many voters and, though his ministers were not able to demonstrate it in office, Wilders insists that the PVV has the answers.Timmermans’ election pledgeTimmermans, meanwhile, has been buoyed in the final days of the campaign by an estimated 45,000 taking part in a climate march at the weekend. His election pledge takes a different tack, asking voters to ‘rediscover the optimism that has always made our country so strong’.The plethora of political parties in the Netherlands means that forming governments requires compromise and coalition. For either side, finding a majority will not be easy, but could be mathematically possible – and that’s where the Netherlands differs from France; where there is no bridging the hard left/right divide.The result of the Dutch election will likely be known by early on Thursday. Then the real work begins.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reign of Torment (Full Episode) | Savage Kingdom Compilation | Nat Geo Animals</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av8j7p_6lcQ</link><author>Nat Geo Animals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/av8j7p_6lcQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 11:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPk9MG2RexnOMGTD-YnSnA">Nat Geo Animals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this intense Full Episode from the Savage Kingdom, a ferocious plague of hyenas rips control from the hands of the lions.

When SpiderMonkey’s optimizing compiler, Ion, is active, we can now produce interactive graphs showing exactly how functions are processed and optimized.You can play with these graphs right here on this page. Simply write some JavaScript code in the  function and see what graph is produced. You can click and drag to navigate, ctrl-scroll to zoom, and drag the slider at the bottom to scrub through the optimization process.As you experiment, take note of how stable the graph layout is, even as the sizes of blocks change or new structures are added. Try clicking a block's title to select it, then drag the slider and watch the graph change while the block remains in place. Or, click an instruction's number to highlight it so you can keep an eye on it across passes.We are not the first to visualize our compiler’s internal graphs, of course, nor the first to make them interactive. But I was not satisfied with the output of common tools like Graphviz or Mermaid, so I decided to create a layout algorithm specifically tailored to our needs. The resulting algorithm is simple, fast, produces surprisingly high-quality output, and can be implemented in less than a thousand lines of code. The purpose of this article is to walk you through this algorithm and the design concepts behind it.Read this post on desktop to see an interactive demo of iongraph.As readers of this blog already know, SpiderMonkey has several tiers of execution for JavaScript and WebAssembly code. The highest tier is known as Ion, an optimizing SSA compiler that takes the most time to compile but produces the highest-quality output.Working with Ion frequently requires us to visualize and debug the SSA graph. Since 2011 we have used a tool for this purpose called iongraph, built by Sean Stangl. It is a simple Python script that takes a JSON dump of our compiler graphs and uses Graphviz to produce a PDF. It is perfectly adequate, and very much the status quo for compiler authors, but unfortunately the Graphviz output has many problems that make our work tedious and frustrating.The first problem is that the Graphviz output rarely bears any resemblance to the source code that produced it. Graphviz will place nodes wherever it feels will minimize error, resulting in a graph that snakes left and right seemingly at random. There is no visual intuition for how deeply nested a block of code is, nor is it easy to determine which blocks are inside or outside of loops. Consider the following function, and its Graphviz graph:Counterintuitively, the  appears  the two assignments in the body of the loop. Since this graph mirrors JavaScript control flow, we’d expect to see the return at the bottom. This problem only gets worse as graphs grow larger and more complex.The second, related problem is that Graphviz’s output is unstable. Small changes to the input can result in large changes to the output. As you page through the graphs of each pass within Ion, nodes will jump left and right, true and false branches will swap, loops will run up the right side instead of the left, and so on. This makes it very hard to understand the actual effect of any given pass. Consider the following before and after, and notice how the second graph is almost—but not quite—a mirror image of the first, despite very minimal changes to the graph’s structure:None of this felt right to me. Control flow graphs should be able to follow the structure of the program that produced them. After all, a control flow graph has many restrictions that a general-purpose tool would not be aware of: they have very few cycles, all of which are well-defined because they come from loops; furthermore, both JavaScript and WebAssembly have reducible control flow, meaning all loops have only one entry, and it is not possible to jump directly into the middle of a loop. This information could be used to our advantage.Beyond that, a static PDF is far from ideal when exploring complicated graphs. Finding the inputs or uses of a given instruction is a tedious and frustrating exercise, as is following arrows from block to block. Even just zooming in and out is difficult. I eventually concluded that we ought to just build an interactive tool to overcome these limitations.How hard could layout be?I had one false start with graph layout, with an algorithm that attempted to sort blocks into vertical “tracks”. This broke down quickly on a variety of programs and I was forced to go back to the drawing board—in fact, back to the source of the very tool I was trying to replace.The algorithm used by , the typical hierarchical layout mode for Graphviz, is known as the Sugiyama layout algorithm, from a 1981 paper by Sugiyama et al. As introduction, I found a short series of lectures that broke down the Sugiyama algorithm into 5 steps:, where the direction of some edges are flipped in order to produce a DAG., where vertices are assigned into horizontal layers according to their depth in the graph, and dummy vertices are added to any edge that crosses multiple layers., where vertices on a layer are reordered in order to minimize the number of edge crossings., where vertices are horizontally positioned in order to make the edges as straight as possible., where the final graph is rendered to the screen.These steps struck me as surprisingly straightforward, and provided useful opportunities to insert our own knowledge of the problem:Cycle breaking would be trivial for us, since the only cycles in our data are loops, and loop backedges are explicitly labeled. We could simply ignore backedges when laying out the graph.Leveling would be straightforward, and could easily be modified to better mimic the source code. Specifically, any blocks coming after a loop in the source code could be artificially pushed down in the layout, solving the confusing early-exit problem.Permuting vertices to reduce edge crossings was actually just a bad idea, since our goal was stability from graph to graph. The true and false branches of a condition should always appear in the same order, for example, and a few edge crossings is a small price to pay for this stability.Since reducible control flow ensures that a program’s loops form a tree, vertex positioning could ensure that loops are always well-nested in the final graph.Taken all together, these simplifications resulted in a remarkably straightforward algorithm, with the initial implementation being just 1000 lines of JavaScript. (See this demo for what it looked like at the time.) It also proved to be very efficient, since it avoided the most computationally complex parts of the Sugiyama algorithm.iongraph from start to finishWe will now go through the entire iongraph layout algorithm. Each section contains explanatory diagrams, in which rectangles are basic blocks and circles are dummy nodes. Loop header blocks (the single entry point to each loop) are additionally colored green.Be aware that the block positions in these diagrams are not representative of the actual computed layout position at each point in the process. For example, vertical positions are not calculated until the very end, but it would be hard to communicate what the algorithm was doing if all blocks were drawn on a single line!We first sort the basic blocks into horizontal tracks called “layers”. This is very simple; we just start at layer 0 and recursively walk the graph, incrementing the layer number as we go. As we go, we track the “height” of each loop, not in pixels, but in layers.We also take this opportunity to vertically position nodes “inside” and “outside” of loops. Whenever we see an edge that exits a loop, we defer the layering of the destination block until we are done layering the loop contents, at which point we know the loop’s height.A note on implementation: nodes are visited multiple times throughout the process, not just once. This can produce a quadratic explosion for large graphs, but I find that an early-out is sufficient to avoid this problem in practice.The animation below shows the layering algorithm in action. Notice how the final block in the graph is visited twice, once after each loop that branches to it, and in each case, the block is deferred until the entire loop has been layered, rather than processed immediately after its predecessor block. The final position of the block is below the entirety of both loops, rather than directly below one of its predecessors as Graphviz would do. (Remember, horizontal and vertical positions have not yet been computed; the positions of the blocks in this diagram are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.)Step 2: Create dummy nodesAny time an edge crosses a layer, we create a dummy node. This allows edges to be routed across layers without overlapping any blocks. Unlike in traditional Sugiyama, we always put downward dummies on the left and upward dummies on the right, producing a consistent “counter-clockwise” flow. This also makes it easy to read long vertical edges, whose direction would otherwise be ambiguous. (Recall how the loop backedge flipped from the right to the left in the “unstable layout” Graphviz example from before.)In addition, we coalesce any edges that are going to the same destination by merging their dummy nodes. This heavily reduces visual noise.This is the fuzziest and most ad-hoc part of the process. Basically, we run lots of small passes that walk up and down the graph, aligning layout nodes with each other. Our edge-straightening passes include:Pushing nodes to the right of their loop header to “indent” them.Walking a layer left to right, moving children to the right to line up with their parents. If any nodes overlap as a result, they are pushed further to the right.Walking a layer right to left, moving parents to the right to line up with their children. This version is more conservative and will not move a node if it would overlap with another. This cleans up most issues from the first pass.Straightening runs of dummy nodes so we have clean vertical lines.“Sucking in” dummy runs on the left side of the graph if there is room for them to move to the right.Straighten out any edges that are “nearly straight”, according to a chosen threshold. This makes the graph appear less wobbly. We do this by repeatedly “combing” the graph upward and downward, aligning parents with children, then children with parents, and so on.It is important to note that dummy nodes participate fully in this system. If for example you have two side-by-side loops, straightening the left loop’s backedge will push the right loop to the side, avoiding overlaps and preserving the graph’s visual structure.We do not reach a fixed point with this strategy, nor do we attempt to. I find that if you continue to repeatedly apply these particular layout passes, nodes will wander to the right forever. Instead, the layout passes are hand-tuned to produce decent-looking results for most of the graphs we look at on a regular basis. That said, this could certainly be improved, especially for larger graphs which do benefit from more iterations.At the end of this step, all nodes have a fixed X-coordinate and will not be modified further.Step 4: Track horizontal edgesEdges may overlap visually as they run horizontally between layers. To resolve this, we sort edges into parallel “tracks”, giving each a vertical offset. After tracking all the edges, we record the total height of the tracks and store it on the preceding layer as its “track height”. This allows us to leave room for the edges in the final layout step.We first sort edges by their starting position, left to right. This produces a consistent arrangement of edges that has few vertical crossings in practice. Edges are then placed into tracks from the “outside in”, stacking rightward edges on top and leftward edges on the bottom, creating a new track if the edge would overlap with or cross any other edge.The diagram below is interactive. Click and drag the blocks to see how the horizontal edges get assigned to tracks.Finally, we assign each node a Y-coordinate. Starting at a Y-coordinate of zero, we iterate through the layers, repeatedly adding the layer’s height and its track height, where the layer height is the maximum height of any node in the layer. All nodes within a layer receive the same Y-coordinate; this is simple and easier to read than Graphviz’s default of vertically centering nodes within a layer.Now that every node has both an X and Y coordinate, the layout process is complete.The details of rendering are out of scope for this article, and depend on the specific application. However, I wish to highlight a stylistic decision that I feel makes our graphs more readable.When rendering edges, we use a style inspired by railroad diagrams. These have many advantages over the Bézier curves employed by Graphviz. First, straight lines feel more organized and are easier to follow when scrolling up and down. Second, they are easy to route (vertical when crossing layers, horizontal between layers). Third, they are easy to coalesce when they share a destination, and the junctions provide a clear indication of the edge’s direction. Fourth, they always cross at right angles, improving clarity and reducing the need to avoid edge crossings in the first place.Consider the following example. There are several edge crossings that may traditionally be considered undesirable—yet the edges and their directions remain clear. Of particular note is the vertical junction highlighted in red on the left: not only is it immediately clear that these edges share a destination, but the junction itself signals that the edges are flowing downward. I find this much more pleasant than the “rat’s nest” that Graphviz tends to produce.It may seem surprising that such a simple (and stupid) layout algorithm could produce such readable graphs, when more sophisticated layout algorithms struggle. However, I feel that the algorithm succeeds  of its simplicity.Most graph layout algorithms are optimization problems, where error is minimized on some chosen metrics. However, these metrics seem to correlate poorly to readability in practice. For example, it seems good in theory to rearrange nodes to minimize edge crossings. But a predictable order of nodes seems to produce more sensible results overall, and simple rules for edge routing are sufficient to keep things tidy. (As a bonus, this also gives us layout stability from pass to pass.) Similarly, layout rules like “align parents with their children” produce more readable results than “minimize the lengths of edges”.Furthermore, by rejecting the optimization problem, a human author gains more control over the layout. We are able to position nodes “inside” of loops, and push post-loop content down in the graph,  we reject this global constraint-solver approach. Minimizing “error” is meaningless compared to a human  meaning through thoughtful design.And finally, the resulting algorithm is simply more efficient. All the layout passes in iongraph are easy to program and scale gracefully to large graphs because they run in roughly linear time. It is better, in my view, to run a fixed number of layout iterations according to your graph complexity and time budget, rather than to run a complex constraint solver until it is “done”.By following this philosophy, even the worst graphs become tractable. Below is a screenshot of a zlib function, compiled to WebAssembly, and rendered using the old tool.It took about  for Graphviz to produce this spaghetti nightmare. By comparison, iongraph can now lay out this function in . The result is still not particularly beautiful, but it renders thousands of times faster  is much easier to navigate.Perhaps programmers ought to put less trust into magic optimizing systems, especially when a human-friendly result is the goal. Simple (and stupid) algorithms can be very effective when applied with discretion and taste.We have already integrated iongraph into the Firefox profiler, making it easy for us to view the graphs of the most expensive or impactful functions we find in our performance work. Unfortunately, this is only available in specific builds of the SpiderMonkey shell, and is not available in full browser builds. This is due to architectural differences in how profiling data is captured and the flags with which the browser and shell are built. I would love for Firefox users to someday be able to view these graphs themselves, but at the moment we have no plans to expose this to the browser. However, one bug tracking some related work can be found here.We will continue to sporadically update iongraph with more features to aid us in our work. We have several ideas for new features, including richer navigation, search, and visualization of register allocation info. However, we have no explicit roadmap for when these features may be released.To experiment with iongraph locally, you can run a debug build of the SpiderMonkey shell with ; this will dump information to . This file can then be loaded into the standalone deployment of iongraph. Please be aware that the user experience is rough and unpolished in its current state.The source code for iongraph can be found on GitHub. If this subject interests you, we would welcome contributions to iongraph and its integration into the browser.

It’s a bit strange, as I honestly thought that this bizarre reflex would be waning as each new generation that increasingly grew up with video games came to be adults. But apparently this needs to be reiterated: law enforcement doesn’t think video games cause violence, literary legends don’t think they cause violence, and, most importantly, scores of scholars don’t think video games cause violence.In Mexico, the story is, in fact, much different. There the crime rate, and violent crime rate, have risen significantly since 2000. The reported reasons for this are roughly what you’d expect: cartel-based crime has exploded and political violence is much more common than in the States.Earlier this week, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a comprehensive financial package that includes an eight percent tax on video games with mature content. As first reported by Insider Gaming, the proposed tax covers games that have a C or D rating under Mexico’s video game age classification system, which is similar to ESRB in the US. The C rating is for players who are at least 18 years old and allows for extreme violence, bloodshed and moderate graphic sexual content, while the D rating is reserved for adults only and allows for prolonged scenes that include similar content.The proposed law was first introduced in September, when the country’s Treasury Department claimed that “recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.” The report cited a study from 2012 in a footnote, which also observed some positive associations with video games, including motor learning and building resilience.The studies referenced in the comment were not cited. And I’d love to see which studies they’re talking about, because I’ve read up on this topic for fifteen years now. Sure, some studies out there suggest those kinds of links. And the larger collective researchers genuinely point out all the problems with the methodology of those studies. Plus, for every one of them there are a ton more that show no causal link between video games and violence.But can I also point out how strange it is to see violent games demonized in this way… only to have the result be an 8% tax on them? If the government  believed its own citizens are dying as a result of these games, why does that same government want to generate tax revenue off of those deaths? And in what world is turning a $50 game into a $54 game the solution to this “problem”?It isn’t, obviously, and that was never the aim here. Instead, you take an easy scapegoat to paper over government failure to control the drug trade and properly police the country for violence and you use that scapegoat as a tax grab. On the backs of dead citizens.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hacking India&apos;s largest automaker: Tata Motors</title><link>https://eaton-works.com/2025/10/28/tata-motors-hack/</link><author>EatonZ</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 01:31:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[2 exposed AWS keys on public-facing websites revealed 70+ TB of sensitive information and infrastructure across hundreds of buckets.Pointless AWS key encryption easily defeated.Tableau backdoor made it possible to log in as anyone without a password, including the server admin. This exposed countless internal projects, financial reports, and dealer dashboards.Exposed Azuga API key compromised test drive fleet management system.If you are in the US and ask your friends and family if they have heard of “Tata Motors”, they would likely say no. However, if you go overseas, Tata Motors and the Tata Group in general are a massive, well-known conglomerate. Back in 2023, I took my hacking adventures overseas and found many vulnerabilities with Tata Motors. This post covers 4 of the most impactful findings I discovered that I am finally ready to share today. Let’s dive in!Note that all secrets/credentials shown have been rotated, meaning they are no longer valid and cannot be used anymore. Additionally, no substantial amounts of data were downloaded as part of any testing, nor was there any obvious evidence of malicious access.AWS Keys in E-Dukaan MarketplaceE-Dukaan is a Tata Motors site where their customers can buy spare parts for their vehicles. It’s a typical E-Commerce site, but it had a dark secret!Can you see it? Right there, in plaintext, are AWS keys. For those unfamiliar, you NEVER EVER want to expose these because people can use them to download all your files stored on Amazon, upload malicious content, rack up massive bills, etc.Intrigued, I put them into S3 Browser to see what it unlocked access to. The answer was.. basically everything. A long list of buckets packed with sensitive information. Here’s a few examples:A customer database backup? Check ✅Customer lists and market intelligence? Yup ✅Hundreds of thousands of invoices for E-Dukaan containing customer information, like PAN? Of course ✅ Absolutely ✅ (about 40 GB worth of reports in here)You may be wondering, where was this AWS keyset actually used? What made it worth the risk of exposing so much? Answer: to download a 4 KB file containing tax codes:Decryptable AWS Keys in FleetEdgeFinding the AWS keys in E-Dukaan was so easy that it felt like cheating. This next one was more challenging (but not by much).FleetEdge is Tata Motors’ fleet management/tracking solution. More info is here. Looking at the API calls that are executed on site load as a guest user, one immediately stuck out:Right there in the response is another set of AWS keys, but this time they were not plaintext – they appeared to be encrypted. A quick search of a decrypt method turned up the exact code, and setting a breakpoint there was enough to reveal the contents:As recently seen with Intel, there seems to be a trend where developers will do this pointless client-side decryption. When the client has the key, it’s strange that anyone would think that would be secure. Maybe these devs knew what the E-Dukaan team was doing and wanted to (try) doing things a little better?This set of AWS keys has a similarly serious impact. There was another long list of new buckets you could access. At one point, S3 Browser had estimated  in one bucket before it crashed. Here’s a few examples:Fleet insights – this is where 70 TB+ of data was found. There was some datalake with files going back to 1996!You also had write access to some websites. You could easily slip in some malware on the frontpage and wreak some havoc.Backdoor admin access to Tableau This flaw is not believed to be linked to Tableau itself and instead was introduced by Tata Motors.Let’s go back to E-Dukaan now. Turns out, it’s the gift that keeps on giving. Poking around the source code of the website, I came across some interesting code:The first obvious issue was the username and password in the comments. If you look closer, you can see an HTTP call to get a “trusted token”. Crucially, it only needs username and site name (no password). Thanks to the code comment, we had a username to try. Performing the HTTP POST manually yielded a token!When you plug that into the infoviz URL like the code does, you will be redirected to Tableau!But there is more fun to be had. This user didn’t have access to much. Since we essentially had a backdoor into Tableau needing only username, we could in theory log in as anyone. One of the cards had the server admin as the owner, and it was possible to get the username that way:With that in hand, I went through the same process of getting a token, and then I had total control over Tableau with access to everything. I didn’t dig too deep after this since it was a lot of sensitive corporate stuff, and I had proven the vulnerability at this point.Azuga is a fleet management platform. Tata Motors used it for their test drive website, presumably to keep tabs on where their cars are. Right there in the JS code was the Azuga token that should never have left the server. A quick API test was enough to confirm it was valid, and that is where I wrapped things up.All 4 issues were reported to Tata Motors through CERT-IN. Tata Motors was a bit slow in rotating the AWS keys. Given what was exposed, I had hoped they would have done it faster. Reported. A response is received shortly after confirming they will take action with the concerned authority. I request an update. Tata Motors shared with CERT-IN (who then shared with me) that the issues are remediated. I confirm  issues were remediated and the AWS keys were still present on the websites, and active. After no updates and finding the AWS issues still not remediated, I send over some more specific steps on what must be done. They confirm receipt and are working on taking action. After this date and up until , there were various back and forth emails trying to get Tata Motors to revoke the AWS keys. I am not sure if something was lost in translation, but it took a lot of pestering and specific instructions to get it done.India’s largest automaker should be more secureCompared to some of my other recent hacks, these weren’t anything super sophisticated. You just had to know where to look. Secrets leak all the time, but the impact is often tempered by the secret having limited access. In this case, having 2 sets of AWS keys leak with access to so much is incredibly concerning. When buying a car, you should be able to trust the automaker will take reasonable actions to keep your data secure. I hope Tata Motors does better in the future – someone else would have absolutely discovered these vulnerabilities at some point, and that would have been a much darker story.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Project Shadowglass</title><link>https://shadowglassgame.com/</link><author>layer8</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 01:06:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arm Ethos NPU Accelerator Driver Expected To Be Merged For Linux 6.19</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Arm-Ethos-NPU-For-Linux-6.19</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:41:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The upcoming Linux 6.19 kernel cycle is now expected to introduce the new "ethosu" accelerator driver for supporting the Arm Ethos U65/U85 neural processing unit IP...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Caused Europe&apos;s Witch Hysteria?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/what-caused-europes-witch-hysteria</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68ff6df8bf5ce37786bbabf9/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=PLNkzpYjH7cdCimGksRKCaztscePy8QXHMlPdMc989k" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Across early modern Europe, fear spread like wildfire; between the 15th and 17th centuries, tens of thousands were accused, tortured, and executed as witches.

available by setting  at build time.
Many workloads spend around 10% less time in the garbage collector, but some
workloads see a reduction of up to 40%!It’s production-ready and already in use at Google, so we encourage you to
try it out.
We know some workloads don’t benefit as much, or even at all, so your feedback
is crucial to helping us move forward.
Based on the data we have now, we plan to make it the default in Go 1.26.What follows is a blog post based on Michael Knyszek’s GopherCon 2025 talk.
We’ll update this blog post with a link to the talk once it’s available online.Tracing garbage collectionBefore we discuss Green Tea let’s get us all on the same page about garbage
collection.The purpose of garbage collection is to automatically reclaim and reuse memory
no longer used by the program.To this end, the Go garbage collector concerns itself with  and
.In the context of the Go runtime,  are Go values whose underlying
memory is allocated from the heap.
Heap objects are created when the Go compiler can’t figure out how else to allocate
memory for a value.
For example, the following code snippet allocates a single heap object: the backing
store for a slice of pointers.var x = make([]*int, 10) // global
The Go compiler can’t allocate the slice backing store anywhere except the heap,
since it’s very hard, and maybe even impossible, for it to know how long  will
refer to the object for. are just numbers that indicate the location of a Go value in memory,
and they’re how a Go program references objects.
For example, to get the pointer to the beginning of the object allocated in the
last code snippet, we can write:Go’s garbage collector follows a strategy broadly referred to as tracing garbage
collection, which just means that the garbage collector follows, or traces, the
pointers in the program to identify which objects the program is still using.More specifically, the Go garbage collector implements the mark-sweep algorithm.
This is much simpler than it sounds.
Imagine objects and pointers as a sort of graph, in the computer science sense.
Objects are nodes, pointers are edges.The mark-sweep algorithm operates on this graph, and as the name might suggest,
proceeds in two phases.In the first phase, the mark phase, it walks the object graph from well-defined
source edges called .
Think global and local variables.
Then, it  everything it finds along the way as , to avoid going in
circles.
This is analogous to your typical graph flood algorithm, like a depth-first or
breadth-first search.Next is the sweep phase.
Whatever objects were not visited in our graph walk are unused, or ,
by the program.
We call this state unreachable because it is impossible with normal safe Go code
to access that memory anymore, simply through the semantics of the language.
To complete the sweep phase, the algorithm simply iterates through all the
unvisited nodes and marks their memory as free, so the memory allocator can reuse
it.You may think I’m oversimplifying a bit here.
Garbage collectors are frequently referred to as , and .
And you’d be partially right, there are more complexities.For example, this algorithm is, in practice, executed concurrently with your
regular Go code.
Walking a graph that’s mutating underneath you brings challenges.
We also parallelize this algorithm, which is a detail that’ll come up again
later.But trust me when I tell you that these details are mostly separate from the
core algorithm.
It really is just a simple graph flood at the center.Let’s walk through an example.
Navigate through the slideshow below to follow along.After all that, I think we have a handle on what the Go garbage collector is actually doing.
This process seems to work well enough today, so what’s the problem?Well, it turns out we can spend  of time executing this particular algorithm in some
programs, and it adds substantial overhead to nearly every Go program.
It’s not that uncommon to see Go programs spending 20% or more of their CPU time in the
garbage collector.Let’s break down where that time is being spent.At a high level, there are two parts to the cost of the garbage collector.
The first is how often it runs, and the second is how much work it does each time it runs.
Multiply those two together, and you get the total cost of the garbage collector.
    Total GC cost = Number of GC cycles × Average cost per GC cycle
    But for now let’s focus only on the second part, the cost per cycle.From years of poring over CPU profiles to try to improve performance, we know two big things
about Go’s garbage collector.The first is that about 90% of the cost of the garbage collector is spent marking,
and only about 10% is sweeping.
Sweeping turns out to be much easier to optimize than marking,
and Go has had a very efficient sweeper for many years.The second is that, of that time spent marking, a substantial portion, usually at least 35%, is
simply spent  on accessing heap memory.
This is bad enough on its own, but it completely gums up the works on what makes modern CPUs
actually fast.“A microarchitectural disaster”What does “gum up the works” mean in this context?
The specifics of modern CPUs can get pretty complicated, so let’s use an analogy.Imagine the CPU driving down a road, where that road is your program.
The CPU wants to ramp up to a high speed, and to do that it needs to be able to see far ahead of it,
and the way needs to be clear.
But the graph flood algorithm is like driving through city streets for the CPU.
The CPU can’t see around corners and it can’t predict what’s going to happen next.
To make progress, it constantly has to slow down to make turns, stop at traffic lights, and avoid
pedestrians.
It hardly matters how fast your engine is because you never get a chance to get going.Let’s make that more concrete by looking at our example again.
I’ve overlaid the heap here with the path that we took.
Each left-to-right arrow represents a piece of scanning work that we did
and the dashed arrows show how we jumped around between bits of scanning work.Notice that we were jumping all over memory doing tiny bits of work in each place.
In particular, we’re frequently jumping between pages, and between different parts of pages.Modern CPUs do a lot of caching.
Going to main memory can be up to 100x slower than accessing memory that’s in our cache.
CPU caches are populated with memory that’s been recently accessed, and memory that’s nearby to
recently accessed memory.
But there’s no guarantee that any two objects that point to each other will  be close to each
other in memory.
The graph flood doesn’t take this into account.Quick side note: if we were just stalling fetches to main memory, it might not be so bad.
CPUs issue memory requests asynchronously, so even slow ones could overlap if the CPU could see
far enough ahead.
But in the graph flood, every bit of work is small, unpredictable, and highly dependent on the
last, so the CPU is forced to wait on nearly every individual memory fetch.And unfortunately for us, this problem is only getting worse.
There’s an adage in the industry of “wait two years and your code will get faster.”But Go, as a garbage collected language that relies on the mark-sweep algorithm, risks the opposite.
“Wait two years and your code will get slower.”
The trends in modern CPU hardware are creating new challenges for garbage collector performance:Non-uniform memory access.
For one, memory now tends to be associated with subsets of CPU cores.
Accesses by  CPU cores to that memory are slower than before.
In other words, the cost of a main memory access depends on which CPU core is accessing
it.
It’s non-uniform, so we call this non-uniform memory access, or NUMA for short.Reduced memory bandwidth.
Available memory bandwidth per CPU is trending downward over time.
This just means that while we have more CPU cores, each core can submit relatively fewer
requests to main memory, forcing non-cached requests to wait longer than before.
Above, we looked at a sequential marking algorithm, but the real garbage collector performs this
algorithm in parallel.
This scales well to a limited number of CPU cores, but the shared queue of objects to scan becomes
a bottleneck, even with careful design.Modern hardware features.
New hardware has fancy features like vector instructions, which let us operate on a lot of data at once.
While this has the potential for big speedups, it’s not immediately clear how to make that work for
marking because marking does so much irregular and often small pieces of work.Finally, this brings us to Green Tea, our new approach to the mark-sweep algorithm.
The key idea behind Green Tea is astonishingly simple:Work with pages, not objects.Sounds trivial, right?
And yet, it took a lot of work to figure out how to order the object graph walk and what we needed to
track to make this work well in practice.More concretely, this means:Instead of scanning objects we scan whole pages.Instead of tracking objects on our work list, we track whole pages.We still need to mark objects at the end of the day, but we’ll track marked objects locally to each
page, rather than across the whole heap.Let’s see what this means in practice by looking at our example heap again, but this time
running Green Tea instead of the straightforward graph flood.As above, navigate through the annotated slideshow to follow along.Let’s come back around to our driving analogy.
Are we finally getting on the highway?Let’s recall our graph flood picture before.We jumped around a whole lot, doing little bits of work in different places.
The path taken by Green Tea looks very different.Green Tea, in contrast, makes fewer, longer left-to-right passes over pages A and B.
The longer these arrows, the better, and with bigger heaps, this effect can be much stronger.
 the magic of Green Tea.It’s also our opportunity to ride the highway.This all adds up to a better fit with the microarchitecture.
We can now scan objects closer together with much higher probability, so
there’s a better chance we can make use of our caches and avoid main memory.
Likewise, per-page metadata is more likely to be in cache.
Tracking pages instead of objects means work lists are smaller,
and less pressure on work lists means less contention and fewer CPU stalls.And speaking of the highway, we can take our metaphorical engine into gears we’ve never been able to
before, since now we can use vector hardware!If you’re only vaguely familiar with vector hardware, you might be confused as to how we can use it here.
But besides the usual arithmetic and trigonometric operations,
recent vector hardware supports two things that are valuable for Green Tea:
very wide registers, and sophisticated bit-wise operations.Most modern x86 CPUs support AVX-512, which has 512-bit wide vector registers.
This is wide enough to hold all of the metadata for an entire page in just two registers,
right on the CPU, enabling Green Tea to work on an entire page in just a few straight-line
instructions.
Vector hardware has long supported basic bit-wise operations on whole vector registers, but starting
with AMD Zen 4 and Intel Ice Lake, it also supports a new bit vector “Swiss army knife” instruction
that enables a key step of the Green Tea scanning process to be done in just a few CPU cycles.
Together, these allow us to turbo-charge the Green Tea scan loop.This wasn’t even an option for the graph flood, where we’d be jumping between scanning objects that
are all sorts of different sizes.
Sometimes you needed two bits of metadata and sometimes you needed ten thousand.
There simply wasn’t enough predictability or regularity to use vector hardware.If you want to nerd out on some of the details, read along!
Otherwise, feel free to skip ahead to the evaluation.To get a sense of what AVX-512 GC scanning looks like, take a look at the diagram below.There’s a lot going on here and we could probably fill an entire blog post just on how this works.
For now, let’s just break it down at a high level:First we fetch the “seen” and “scanned” bits for a page.
Recall, these are one bit per object in the page, and all objects in a page have the same size.Next, we compare the two bit sets.
Their union becomes the new “scanned” bits, while their difference is the “active objects” bitmap,
which tells us which objects we need to scan in this pass over the page (versus previous passes).We take the difference of the bitmaps and “expand” it, so that instead of one bit per object,
we have one bit per word (8 bytes) of the page.
We call this the “active words” bitmap.
For example, if the page stores 6-word (48-byte) objects, each bit in the active objects bitmap
will be copied to 6 bits in the active words bitmap.
Like so: → 000000 000000 111111 111111 ...Next we fetch the pointer/scalar bitmap for the page.
Here, too, each bit corresponds to a word (8 bytes) of the page, and it tells us whether that word
stores a pointer.
This data is managed by the memory allocator.Now, we take the intersection of the pointer/scalar bitmap and the active words bitmap.
The result is the “active pointer bitmap”: a bitmap that tells us the location of every
pointer in the entire page contained in any live object we haven’t scanned yet.Finally, we can iterate over the memory of the page and collect all the pointers.
Logically, we iterate over each set bit in the active pointer bitmap,
load the pointer value at that word, and write it back to a buffer that
will later be used to mark objects seen and add pages to the work list.
Using vector instructions, we’re able to do this 64 bytes at a time,
in just a couple instructions.Part of what makes this fast is the  instruction,
part of the “Galois Field New Instructions” x86 extension,
and the bit manipulation Swiss army knife we referred to above.
It’s the real star of the show, since it lets us do step (3) in the scanning kernel very, very
efficiently.
It performs a bit-wise affine
transformations,
treating each byte in a vector as itself a mathematical vector of 8 bits
and multiplying it by an 8x8 bit matrix.
This is all done over the Galois field,
which just means multiplication is AND and addition is XOR.
The upshot of this is that we can define a few 8x8 bit matrices for each
object size that perform exactly the 1:n bit expansion we need.For the full assembly code, see this
file.
The “expanders” use different matrices and different permutations for each size class,
so they’re in a separate file
that’s written by a code generator.
Aside from the expansion functions, it’s really not a lot of code.
Most of it is dramatically simplified by the fact that we can perform most of the above
operations on data that sits purely in registers.
And, hopefully soon this assembly code will be replaced with Go code!Credit to Austin Clements for devising this process.
It’s incredibly cool, and incredibly fast!So that’s it for how it works.
How much does it actually help?It can be quite a lot.
Even without the vector enhancements, we see reductions in garbage collection CPU costs
between 10% and 40% in our benchmark suite.
For example, if an application spends 10% of its time in the garbage collector, then that
would translate to between a 1% and 4% overall CPU reduction, depending on the specifics of
the workload.
A 10% reduction in garbage collection CPU time is roughly the modal improvement.
(See the GitHub issue for some of these details.)We’ve rolled Green Tea out inside Google, and we see similar results at scale.We’re still rolling out the vector enhancements,
but benchmarks and early results suggest this will net an additional 10% GC CPU reduction.While most workloads benefit to some degree, there are some that don’t.Green Tea is based on the hypothesis that we can accumulate enough objects to scan on a
single page in one pass to counteract the costs of the accumulation process.
This is clearly the case if the heap has a very regular structure: objects of the same size at a
similar depth in the object graph.
But there are some workloads that often require us to scan only a single object per page at a time.
This is potentially worse than the graph flood because we might be doing more work than before while
trying to accumulate objects on pages and failing.The implementation of Green Tea has a special case for pages that have only a single object to scan.
This helps reduce regressions, but doesn’t completely eliminate them.However, it takes a lot less per-page accumulation to outperform the graph flood
than you might expect.
One surprise result of this work was that scanning a mere 2% of a page at a time
can yield improvements over the graph flood.Green Tea is already available as an experiment in the recent Go 1.25 release and can be enabled
by setting the environment variable  to  at build time.
This doesn’t include the aforementioned vector acceleration.We expect to make it the default garbage collector in Go 1.26, but you’ll still be able to opt-out
with GOEXPERIMENT=nogreenteagc at build time.
Go 1.26 will also add vector acceleration on newer x86 hardware, and include a whole bunch of
tweaks and improvements based on feedback we’ve collected so far.If you can, we encourage you to try at Go tip-of-tree!
If you prefer to use Go 1.25, we’d still love your feedback.
See this GitHub
comment with some details on
what diagnostics we’d be interested in seeing, if you can share, and the preferred channels for
reporting feedback.Before we wrap up this blog post, let’s take a moment to talk about the journey that got us here.
The human element of the technology.The core of Green Tea may seem like a single, simple idea.
Like the spark of inspiration that just one single person had.But that’s not true at all.
Green Tea is the result of work and ideas from many people over several years.
Several people on the Go team contributed to the ideas, including Michael Pratt, Cherry Mui, David
Chase, and Keith Randall.
Microarchitectural insights from Yves Vandriessche, who was at Intel at the time, also really helped
direct the design exploration.
There were a lot of ideas that didn’t work, and there were a lot of details that needed figuring out.
Just to make this single, simple idea viable.The seeds of this idea go all the way back to 2018.
What’s funny is that everyone on the team thinks someone else thought of this initial idea.Green Tea got its name in 2024 when Austin worked out a prototype of an earlier version while cafe
crawling in Japan and drinking LOTS of matcha!
This prototype showed that the core idea of Green Tea was viable.
And from there we were off to the races.Throughout 2025, as Michael implemented and productionized Green Tea, the ideas evolved and changed even

While the quantum computing paradigm promises many benefits, it also threatens the security of the Internet by breaking much of the cryptography we have come to rely on.To mitigate this threat, Cloudflare is helping to migrate the Internet to Post-Quantum (PQ) cryptography. Today,  of traffic to Cloudflare's edge network is protected against the most urgent threat: an attacker who can intercept and store encrypted traffic today and then decrypt it in the future with the help of a quantum computer. This is referred to as the harvest now, decrypt laterthreat.However, this is just one of the threats we need to address. A quantum computer can also be used to crack a server's  certificate, allowing an attacker to impersonate the server to unsuspecting clients. The good news is that we already have PQ algorithms we can use for quantum-safe authentication. The bad news is that adoption of these algorithms in TLS will require significant changes to one of the most complex and security-critical systems on the Internet: the Web Public-Key Infrastructure (WebPKI).The central problem is the sheer size of these new algorithms: signatures for ML-DSA-44, one of the most performant PQ algorithms standardized by NIST, are 2,420 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA-P256, the most popular non-PQ signature in use today; and its public keys are 1,312 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA. That's a roughly 20-fold increase in size. Worse yet, the average TLS handshake includes a number of public keys and signatures, adding up to 10s of kilobytes of overhead per handshake. This is enough to have a  on the performance of TLS.That makes drop-in PQ certificates a tough sell to enable today: they don’t bring any security benefit before Q-day — the day a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives — but they do degrade performance. We could sit and wait until Q-day is a year away, but that’s playing with fire. Migrations always take longer than expected, and by waiting we risk the security and privacy of the Internet, which is .It's clear that we must find a way to make post-quantum certificates cheap enough to deploy today by default for everyone — not just those that can afford it. In this post, we'll introduce you to the plan we’ve brought together with industry partners to the  to redesign the WebPKI in order to allow a smooth transition to PQ authentication with no performance impact (and perhaps a performance improvement!). We'll provide an overview of one concrete proposal, called Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs), whose goal is to whittle down the number of public keys and signatures in the TLS handshake to the bare minimum required.But talk is cheap. We  that, as with any change to the Internet, it's crucial to test early and often. Today we're announcing our intent to deploy MTCs on an experimental basis in collaboration with Chrome Security. In this post, we'll describe the scope of this experiment, what we hope to learn from it, and how we'll make sure it's done safely.The WebPKI today — an old system with many patchesWhy does the TLS handshake have so many public keys and signatures?Let's start with Cryptography 101. When your browser connects to a website, it asks the server to  itself to make sure it's talking to the real server and not an impersonator. This is usually achieved with a cryptographic primitive known as a digital signature scheme (e.g., ECDSA or ML-DSA). In TLS, the server signs the messages exchanged between the client and server using its , and the client verifies the signature using the server's . In this way, the server confirms to the client that they've had the same conversation, since only the server could have produced a valid signature.If the client already knows the server's public key, then only  is required to authenticate the server. In practice, however, this is not really an option. The web today is made up of around a billion TLS servers, so it would be unrealistic to provision every client with the public key of every server. What's more, the set of public keys will change over time as new servers come online and existing ones rotate their keys, so we would need some way of pushing these changes to clients.This scaling problem is at the heart of the design of all PKIs.Instead of expecting the client to know the server's public key in advance, the server might just send its public key during the TLS handshake. But how does the client know that the public key actually belongs to the server? This is the job of a .A certificate binds a public key to the identity of the server — usually its DNS name, e.g., . The certificate is signed by a Certification Authority (CA) whose public key is known to the client. In addition to verifying the server's handshake signature, the client verifies the signature of this certificate. This establishes a chain of trust: by accepting the certificate, the client is trusting that the CA verified that the public key actually belongs to the server with that identity.Clients are typically configured to trust many CAs and must be provisioned with a public key for each. Things are much easier however, since there are only 100s of CAs instead of billions. In addition, new certificates can be created without having to update clients.These efficiencies come at a relatively low cost: for those counting at home, that's  signature and  public key, for a total of 2 signatures and 1 public key per TLS handshake.That's not the end of the story, however. As the WebPKI has evolved, so have these chains of trust grown a bit longer. These days it's common for a chain to consist of two or more certificates rather than just one. This is because CAs sometimes need to rotatetheir keys, just as servers do. But before they can start using the new key, they must distribute the corresponding public key to clients. This takes time, since it requires billions of clients to update their trust stores. To bridge the gap, the CA will sometimes use the old key to issue a certificate for the new one and append this certificate to the end of the chain.That's signature and public key, which brings us to 3 signatures and 2 public keys. And we still have a little ways to go.The main job of a CA is to verify that a server has control over the domain for which it’s requesting a certificate. This process has evolved over the years from a high-touch, CA-specific process to a standardized,  used for issuing most certificates on the web. (Not all CAs fully support automation, however.) This evolution is marked by a number of security incidents in which a certificate was to a party other than the server, allowing that party to impersonate the server to any client that trusts the CA.Automation helps, but  are still possible, and mistakes are almost inevitable. , several certificates for Cloudflare's encrypted 1.1.1.1 resolver were issued without our involvement or authorization. This apparently occurred by accident, but it nonetheless put users of 1.1.1.1 at risk. (The mis-issued certificates have since been revoked.)Ensuring mis-issuance is detectable is the job of the Certificate Transparency (CT) ecosystem. The basic idea is that each certificate issued by a CA gets added to a public . Servers can audit these logs for certificates issued in their name. If ever a certificate is issued that they didn't request itself, the server operator can prove the issuance happened, and the PKI ecosystem can take action to prevent the certificate from being trusted by clients.Major browsers, including Firefox and Chrome and its derivatives, require certificates to be logged before they can be trusted. For example, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox will only accept the server's certificate if it appears in at least two logs the browser is configured to trust. This policy is easy to state, but tricky to implement in practice:Operating a CT log has historically been fairly expensive. Logs ingest billions of certificates over their lifetimes: when an incident happens, or even just under high load, it can take some time for a log to make a new entry available for auditors.Clients can't really audit logs themselves, since this would expose their browsing history (i.e., the servers they wanted to connect to) to the log operators.The solution to both problems is to include a signature from the CT log along with the certificate. The signature is produced immediately in response to a request to log a certificate, and attests to the log's intent to include the certificate in the log within 24 hours.Per browser policy, certificate transparency adds  signatures to the TLS handshake, one for each log. This brings us to a total of 5 signatures and 2 public keys in a typical handshake on the public web.The WebPKI is a living, breathing, and highly distributed system. We've had to patch it a number of times over the years to keep it going, but on balance it has served our needs quite well — until now.Previously, whenever we needed to update something in the WebPKI, we would tack on another signature. This strategy has worked because conventional cryptography is so cheap. But 5 signatures and 2 public keys on average for each TLS handshake is simply too much to cope with for the larger PQ signatures that are coming.The good news is that by moving what we already have around in clever ways, we can drastically reduce the number of signatures we need.Crash course on Merkle Tree CertificatesMerkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) is a proposal for the next generation of the WebPKI that we are implementing and plan to deploy on an experimental basis. Its key features are as follows:All the information a client needs to validate a Merkle Tree Certificate can be disseminated out-of-band. If the client is sufficiently up-to-date, then the TLS handshake needs just 1 signature, 1 public key, and 1 Merkle tree inclusion proof. This is quite small, even if we use post-quantum algorithms.The MTC specification makes certificate transparency a first class feature of the PKI by having each CA run its own log of exactly the certificates they issue.Let's poke our head under the hood a little. Below we have an MTC generated by one of our internal tests. This would be transmitted from the server to the client in the TLS handshake:-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

        5d:0c:28:bc:87:58:58:15:00:00While some of the parameters probably look familiar, others will look unusual. On the familiar side, the subject and public key are exactly what we might expect: the DNS name is  and the public key is for a familiar signature algorithm, ECDSA-P256. This algorithm is not PQ, of course — in the future we would put ML-DSA-44 there instead.On the unusual side, OpenSSL appears to not recognize the signature algorithm of the issuer and just prints the raw OID and bytes of the signature. There's a good reason for this: the MTC does not have a signature in it at all! So what exactly are we looking at?The trick to leave out signatures is that a Merkle Tree Certification Authority (MTCA) produces its  certificates  rather than individually. In place of a signature, the certificate has an  of the certificate in a batch of certificates signed by the MTCA.To understand how inclusion proofs work, let's think about a slightly simplified version of the MTC specification. To issue a batch, the MTCA arranges the unsigned certificates into a data structure called a  that looks like this:Each leaf of the tree corresponds to a certificate, and each inner node is equal to the hash of its children. To sign the batch, the MTCA uses its secret key to sign the head of the tree. The structure of the tree guarantees that each certificate in the batch was signed by the MTCA: if we tried to tweak the bits of any one of the certificates, the treehead would end up having a different value, which would cause the signature to fail.An inclusion proof for a certificate consists of the hash of each sibling node along the path from the certificate to the treehead:Given a validated treehead, this sequence of hashes is sufficient to prove inclusion of the certificate in the tree. This means that, in order to validate an MTC, the client also needs to obtain the signed treehead from the MTCA.This is the key to MTC's efficiency:Signed treeheads can be disseminated to clients out-of-band and validated offline. Each validated treehead can then be used to validate any certificate in the corresponding batch, eliminating the need to obtain a signature for each server certificate.During the TLS handshake, the client tells the server which treeheads it has. If the server has a signatureless certificate covered by one of those treeheads, then it can use that certificate to authenticate itself. That's 1 signature,1 public key and 1 inclusion proof per handshake, both for the server being authenticated.Now, that's the simplified version. MTC proper has some more bells and whistles. To start, it doesn’t create a separate Merkle tree for each batch, but it grows a single large tree, which is used for better transparency. As this tree grows, periodically (sub)tree heads are selected to be shipped to browsers, which we call . In the common case browsers will be able to fetch the most recent landmarks, and servers can wait for batch issuance, but we need a fallback: MTC also supports certificates that can be issued immediately and don’t require landmarks to be validated, but these are not as small. A server would provision both types of Merkle tree certificates, so that the common case is fast, and the exceptional case is slow, but at least it’ll work.Ever since early designs for MTCs emerged, we’ve been eager to experiment with the idea. In line with the IETF principle of “”, it often takes implementing a protocol to work out kinks in the design. At the same time, we cannot risk the security of users. In this section, we describe our approach to experimenting with aspects of the Merkle Tree Certificates design  changing any trust relationships.Let’s start with what we hope to learn. We have lots of questions whose answers can help to either validate the approach, or uncover pitfalls that require reshaping the protocol — in fact, an implementation of an early MTC draft by  and  did exactly this. We’d like to know: Protocol ossification (the tendency of implementation bugs to make it harder to change a protocol) is an ever-present issue with deploying protocol changes. For TLS in particular, despite having built-in flexibility, time after time we’ve found that if that flexibility is not regularly used, there will be buggy implementations and middleboxes that break when they see things they don’t recognize. TLS 1.3 deployment  than we hoped for this very reason. And more recently, the rollout of PQ key exchange in TLS caused the Client Hello to be split over multiple TCP packets, something that many middleboxes .What is the performance impact? In fact, we expect MTCs to the size of the handshake, even compared to today's non-PQ certificates. They will also reduce CPU cost: ML-DSA signature verification is about as fast as ECDSA, and there will be far fewer signatures to verify. We therefore expect to see a . We would like to see if there is a measurable performance improvement.What fraction of clients will stay up to date? Getting the performance benefit of MTCs requires the clients and servers to be roughly in sync with one another. We expect MTCs to have fairly short lifetimes, a week or so. This means that if the client's latest landmark is older than a week, the server would have to fallback to a larger certificate. Knowing how often this fallback happens will help us tune the parameters of the protocol to make fallbacks less likely.In order to answer these questions, we are implementing MTC support in our TLS stack and in our certificate issuance infrastructure. For their part, Chrome is implementing MTC support in their own TLS stack and will stand up infrastructure to disseminate landmarks to their users.As we've done in past experiments, we plan to enable MTCs for a subset of our free customers with enough traffic that we will be able to get useful measurements. Chrome will control the experimental rollout: they can ramp up slowly, measuring as they go and rolling back if and when bugs are found.Which leaves us with one last question: who will run the Merkle Tree CA?Bootstrapping trust from the existing WebPKIStanding up a proper CA is no small task: it takes years to be trusted by major browsers. That’s why Cloudflare isn’t going to become a “real” CA for this experiment, and Chrome isn’t going to trust us directly.Instead, to make progress on a reasonable timeframe, without sacrificing due diligence, we plan to "mock" the role of the MTCA. We will run an MTCA (on  based on our ), but for each MTC we issue, we also publish an existing certificate from a trusted CA that agrees with it. We call this the . When Chrome’s infrastructure pulls updates from our MTCA log, they will also pull these bootstrap certificates, and check whether they agree. Only if they do, they’ll proceed to push the corresponding landmarks to Chrome clients. In other words, Cloudflare is effectively just “re-encoding” an existing certificate (with domain validation performed by a trusted CA) as an MTC, and Chrome is using certificate transparency to keep us honest.With almost 50% of our traffic already protected by post-quantum encryption, we’re halfway to a fully post-quantum secure Internet. The second part of our journey, post-quantum certificates, is the hardest yet though. A simple drop-in upgrade has a noticeable performance impact and no security benefit before Q-day. This means it’s a hard sell to enable today by default. But here we are playing with fire: migrations always take longer than expected. If we want to keep an ubiquitously private and secure Internet, we need a post-quantum solution that’s performant enough to be enabled by default .Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) solves this problem by reducing the number of signatures and public keys to the bare minimum while maintaining the WebPKI's essential properties. We plan to roll out MTCs to a fraction of free accounts by early next year. This does not affect any visitors that are not part of the Chrome experiment. For those that are, thanks to the bootstrap certificates, there is no impact on security.We’re excited to keep the Internet fast  secure, and will report back soon on the results of this experiment: watch this space! MTC is evolving as we speak, if you want to get involved, please join the IETF .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ring, Flock Safety Join Forces To Expand Law Enforcement Surveillance Networks</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/28/ring-flock-safety-join-forces-to-expand-law-enforcement-surveillance-networks/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 22:34:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m not saying this unholy matrimony wouldn’t have occurred under  other regime, but it’s definitely the sort of thing that plays well with the Oval Office while it’s housing Donald Trump.Both Flock Safety and Ring have weathered plenty of negative press, largely because they were doing the sort of thing they’re going back to doing : turning private cameras into extensions of government surveillance networks. Flock Safety began by pitching its products to some of the most secure people in the nation: wealthy white homeowners. Flock Safety became just another way for gated communities and HOAs to keep a tab on residents while also casting a skeptical eye towards anyone (or any vehicles) those running the cameras didn’t immediately recognize. Then it invited cops to play with its equipment and install some of their own. It went from keeping black people out of white neighborhoods to becoming a tool to be wielded by cops as they searched for a woman who had terminated a pregnancy — not because cops cared about her well-being, but at the behest of her apparently abusive boyfriend. Law enforcement investigators and officials claimed the nationwide searches for the person seeking an abortion was all about finding her safely. Even after internal documents revealed it was  about finding her in hopes of pressing charges for violating Texas’s abortion ban, Flock Safety has continued to criticize journalists for reporting on this apparent abuse of its camera network.Ring democratized front door surveillance, for better or worse. It gave people a cheap option for keeping crime off their literal doorstep. But it also invited cops along for the ride, giving them free cameras to hand out to citizens with the implied suggestion a free camera would result in warrantless access to footage any time the cops felt like looking at it. Ring finally rolled back its carte blanche cop access and demanded a bit more paperwork from law enforcement before allowing it to raid its cloud storage. Flock Safety — in response to congressional criticism — made vague statements about limiting abuse of camera access by law enforcement. Of course, those words were meaningless, as Senator Ron Wyden recently pointed out in a letter to Flock Safety CEO Garret Langley:In August, 9 News in Denver revealed that Flock granted U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) access to its systems, enabling the agency to search data collected by Flock’s cameras, including using the National Lookup Tool. Officials from Flock subsequently confirmed to my office in September that the company provided access to CBP, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Secret Service, and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service as part of a pilot earlier this year. Flock told my office that during the pilot, which has now ended, CBP and HSI conducted approximately 200 and 175 searches respectively. Flock also confirmed that itmisled its state and local law enforcement customers, telling my office that “due to internal miscommunication, customers were inaccurately informed that Flock did not have any relationship with DHS, while pilot programs with sub-agencies of DHS were briefly active.”The abortion investigation described above is also mentioned in the letter, which closes with Ron Wyden telling the company that no one should trust what Flock Safety says because when it’s not misleading people, it’s both incapable and unwilling to place meaningful restrictions on law enforcement access to its nationwide network of cameras: The privacy protection that Flock promised to Oregonians — that Flock software will automatically examine the reason provided by law enforcement officers for terms indicating an abortion- or immigration-related search — is meaningless when law enforcement officials provide generic reasons like “investigation” or “crime.” Likewise, Flock’s filters are meaningless if no reason for a search is provided in the first place. While the search reasons collected by Flock, obtained by press and activists through open records requests, have occasionally revealed searches for immigration and abortion enforcement, these are likely just the tip of the iceberg. Presumably, most officers using Flock to hunt down immigrants and women who have received abortions are not going to type that in as the reason for their search. And, regardless, given that Flock has washed its hands of any obligation to audit its customers, Flock customers have no reason to trust a search reason provided by another agency.I now believe that abuses of your product are not only likely but inevitable, and that Flock is unable and uninterested in preventing them.Law enforcement agencies will soon have easier access to footage captured by Amazon’s Ring smart cameras. In a partnership announced this week, Amazon will allow approximately 5,000 local law enforcement agencies to request access to Ring camera footage via surveillance platforms from Flock Safety. According to Flock’s announcement, its Ring partnership allows local law enforcement members to use Flock software “to send a direct post in the Ring Neighbors app with details about the investigation and request voluntary assistance.” Requests must include “specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated,” and users can look at the requests anonymously, Flock said.Flock said its local law enforcement users will gain access to Ring Community Requests in “the coming months.”We absolutely didn’t need these two major players in the private surveillance market to team up and offer expanded access to US law enforcement — especially when so much of US law enforcement is focused on the “criminal” acts listed in Wyden’s letter: abortions and immigration. According to Ars Technica’s reporting, Ring is the most active participant in this new surveillance dragnet. First, Ring rolled back its promise to limit law enforcement access to Ring footage by partnering with Axon, a heavy-hitter in the US body camera marketplace. Then it decided to court one of the rivals in its own marketplace, which means both companies can still pretend to hold unique ideals while ensuring the bastard child of this coupling will render those ideals irrelevant. Flock says that its cameras don’t use facial recognition, which has been criticized for racial biases. But local law enforcement agencies using Flock will soon have access to footage from Ring cameras with facial recognition.Both companies will be able to blame each other the next time abusive access is revealed. And Ring’s network will presumably gain features it doesn’t have currently via its meshing with Flock, like license plate recognition and an algorithm that can be applied to Ring footage that allows cops to do things it can’t with Ring alone, like search for suspects using nothing but vehicle or clothing descriptions.And this assurance is  meaningless, given what’s already known about both of these companies: Amazon and Flock say their collaboration will only involve voluntary customers and local enforcement agencies. When both companies store recordings in their own clouds, “voluntary” is beside the point. Law enforcement can just approach either company directly with warrants or subpoenas and get what has been denied to them by these companies’ customers. And restraining searches to “local law enforcement” agencies is impossible if neither company is interested in limiting searches to local areas and/or taking steps to prevent local agencies from performing searches on behalf of federal officers. Even if both companies take heat for doing this, they’ll still do it. After all, they’ve got an entire administration standing behind them that’s willing to call anyone who questions or criticizes this unofficial merger a friend of criminals, if not an actual enemy of the nation. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Red Hat Affirms Plans To Distribute NVIDIA CUDA Across RHEL, Red Hat AI &amp; OpenShift</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Red-Hat-Distribute-CUDA-RHEL</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 21:52:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following Canonical announcing plans to better support NVIDIA CUDA on Ubuntu Linux and make it easier to install as well as SUSE better supporting CUDA along similar lines, Red Hat today affirmed their plans to do the same.

If Tor Browser is important to you, now is a great time to support our mission to , as all donations will be matched by Power Up Privacy through December 31, 2025.Tor Browser 15.0 inherits a multitude of useful new features and usability improvements from Firefox that have passed our audit. For desktop, these include vertical tabs: providing a more manageable, alternative layout with open and pinned tabs stacked in a sidebar rather than across the top of the window. For ease of access, Bookmarks can be retrieved directly from the sidebar when expanded too. However, regardless of whether you prefer horizontal or vertical tabs, everyone  benefits from the addition of tab groups: helping you keep on top of the clutter by organizing tabs into collapsible groups that can be given names and color-coded. Tor Browser 15.0 also inherits elements of Firefox's recent address bar refresh, including a new unified search button that allows you to switch search engines on the fly, search bookmarks or tabs, and reference quick actions from the same menu.Note that Tor Browser tabs are still private tabs, and will clear when you close the browser. This enforces a kind of natural tidiness in Tor Browser since each new session starts fresh – however for privacy-conscious power users, project managers, researchers, or anyone else who accumulates tabs frighteningly quickly, we hope these organizational improvements will give you a much needed productivity boost.On Android, screen lock adds an extra layer of security to your browsing sessions. After enabling screen lock in Settings > Tabs, your tabs will lock automatically when you switch away from the browser without closing it. Upon returning to the app, you'll be prompted to unlock your tabs using your fingerprint, face, or pass code, depending on which option your device is configured to use.Like Tor Browser for Desktop, your browsing session will still be cleared when Tor Browser is closed. However, this feature provides peace of mind in a specific scenario: by ensuring that your browsing remains private even if someone has gained temporary access to your unlocked phone with Tor Browser open in the background – whether you've handed it to a friend, or left your device sitting on a table.Updates to Android and Linux device compatibilityAt present, Firefox 140 and Tor Browser 15.0 support Android 5.0 or later, which was released almost 11 years ago. While Mozilla's commitment to support such an old version of Android is admirable, it introduces several technical and security challenges for developers. As a consequence, Firefox have announced their intention to increase the minimum support requirements to Android 8.0, and have also decided to drop support for x86 CPUs for Android and Linux. Sadly, it's not possible for the Tor Project to maintain support for these platforms on our own without official support from Mozilla.While these changes won't impact Tor Browser users immediately, we expect them to take effect with the release of Tor Browser 16.0 mid-next year. This means that Tor Browser 15.0 will be the last major release to support x86 for Linux and Android, in addition to Android 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, we will continue to release minor updates with security fixes for these platforms until Tor Browser 16.0's eventual release.Although nobody wants to see support for their platform get dropped, it's an important step to maintain the stability and security of both Firefox and Tor Browser over time, and will allow developers to utilize newer technologies in both browsers. In addition, supporting x86 for Android has been particularly challenging for our developers due to the 100MB package size limit imposed by Google Play. While we have deployed several workarounds to stay within this limit in the recent past, these often come at a cost – such as x86 Android users missing out on the Conjure pluggable transport, for example.Disabling of WebAssembly now managed by NoScriptWebAssembly (or Wasm) is a web technology that helps websites and web apps run faster. It allows web developers to write programs in languages like C, C++ or Rust, and compiles these into a special format that web browsers can run more efficiently.As has been suggested in this meta-analysis from 2024, further investigation of Wasm's potential exploits is necessary – therefore Wasm is currently disabled in the Safer and Safest security levels in order to reduce Tor Browser's attack surface. Up until now, this was achieved by setting the global preference  to false – however this approach was no longer viable after Mozilla implemented part of their PDF reader in Wasm between versions 128 and 140. Consequently, we have decided to move control of Wasm to NoScript, which is bundled with Tor Browser, and already manages JavaScript and other security features. This means that Wasm now works on privileged browser pages such as the PDF renderer, but NoScript will continue blocking the technology on regular websites at the Safer and Safest security levels.Users who have manually set  to "false" while in the Standard security level will see their security level represented as "Custom" instead. To mitigate any issues that may arise with the browser's PDF reader, we encourage those users to switch the preference back to "true", thereby passing management of Wasm over to NoScript. Furthermore, manually disabling Wasm at the Standard security level (either via NoScript or ) may also make your fingerprint more unique by deviating from Tor Browser's default configuration. To avoid this scenario, we recommend sticking with one of the pre-defined security levels and caution users against making further changes to individual preferences in about:config.Alternatively, should you wish to keep Wasm disabled in future, we invite you to increase your security level to Safer or Safest going forward. Note that both Safer and Safest users may notice  switch to "true" automatically as management of Wasm is passed over to and blocked by NoScript, meaning that you are still protected regardless. In addition, Safest users in particular are not vulnerable to any potential vulnerabilities introduced by Wasm since the format requires JavaScript to work.Tor Browser 15.0 comes with a number of known issues that can be found in Tor Browser's issue tracker. In particular, we would like to highlight the following:The initial release of vertical tabs in Tor Browser includes a couple of quirks:When the sidebar is visible (such as when vertical tabs are enabled), the window may visibly resize when Tor Browser is launched.Due to variations in window size, Letterboxing may be visible. You still get the anti-fingerprinting protections provided by Letterboxing, but the default window size will be different than intended.We are currently working to issue a fix for both of these bugs. Please see tor-browser#44096 for details.Web pages may not load after updating Tor Browser on older versions of Android. This can be fixed by clearing your app cache manually in Settings > Apps > Tor Browser > Storage & cache.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Admin’s Racist Halo Memes Are ‘A New Level of Dehumanization of Immigrants’</title><link>https://www.404media.co/trump-admins-racist-halo-memes-are-a-new-level-of-dehumanization-of-immigrants/</link><author>Matthew Gault</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/halo-ice.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 21:13:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday morning, the Trump administration used a picture of ’s Master Chief to call for the destruction of immigrants.

One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: why do some towers blink?Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.Joe: Well red lighting is a thing. It's in the regulations, it specifies red lighting or white lighting, and one of the things like the red lights can be a bulb like this inside of a red housing, could be LED.Jeff: Where'd you find this bulb? This was not in my studio.Joe: This bulb is a spare bulb for a tower site. And most of us use the same bulb, same socket, 620 watts. It's a very standard broadcast bulb for a broadcast tower. And a lot of the beacons, they're pretty tall and they'll have one right-side up, and one upside-down. So they'll have two bulbs in the socket. That way, when one bulb burns out, you realize you have a bulb out, but you're still legal with the second bulb.Jeff: At my house, I don't have any of this kind of bulb anymore [incandescent]. I have, you know, this is a little bit different size, these are LED. Is that similar on towers?Joe: Yeah. So it is the same. Like an LED assembly for a tower could be kind of flat, and it has, you know, it's set to just do what it needs to do. So in like white light, that's, typically it used to be always strobes. And at KMOX, you remember we had the whole assembly there. and you see the glass bulb, with xenon gas inside.So those were the old way for that, but the newer ones are all white LED, and they can be little pancake-looking things compared to what the things are now. They can direct that LED light really to help airplanes and have less trouble for people who live in homes or apartment buildings nearby.Jeff: So if they have a tower like the one that's just north of here that's in a residential area, you're not just flashing everybody constantly.Jeff: You know, thinking about that tower, though, why do different towers have different lighting and different colors and things? And I even remember, like, on the tower that's right by here, there's actually teeny tiny little lights that are, like, on the sides, on the legs of the tower.Joe: Yeah, well, tower lighting is in the responsibility of FAA, and they have a detailed plan. The options depend on the heights of the tower, where they are at. The location is obviously important. And sometimes red is a good solution, sometimes white, and sometimes both, red and white solution. And an example is the tower that you're talking about.Jeff: So why would you want both? It seems like that's twice the complexity.Joe: You would have strobe in the day and red at night. And people in their homes at night, a pulsing red light is a lot easier than a big flashing white light.Jeff: So sometimes if people are complaining about it, you might go to that solution.Joe: You can propose the red at night and the dual lighting works. And then you literally see these two packs and one will be red and one will be white. That's what I've seen mostly, although I heard that they make one now. It's all in one.Jeff: [sarcastically] You could have RGB lights—could you do Home Assistant for your tower lighting?Joe: You'd have RGB, but that would not be allowed by the FAA.Jeff: We'll actually talk about that a little bit too later, because there are some regulations for how you actually monitor these things.Jeff: But before we get to that, what about the one tower I saw didn't have any lights that were blinking at all. And I zoomed in and I saw that there was a light on top, but it just wasn't doing anything.Joe: Yeah. Well, and this is about daytime mode. So a tower that's painted, and that's legal for obstruction marking, and you don't have to light during the day. So at night, their lights would come on. So you can be in a situation where, like here, you could see three towers. One might be day and night with white light, and two of them might be red light day only, but one kicks on earlier than the other because of their exact photo cell triggering the lights.Jeff: Or if the photo cell is covered by a layer of soot from 40 years...Joe: Yeah. So that tower is probably in daytime mode, or it could be an AM tower. An AM tower below 200 feet doesn't have to be lit, so that's another one. In fact, all towers, I guess, under 200 feet, unless you're in a particular area where the FAA would require it.Jeff: You always have to refer back to the documentation.Joe: You always refer to the documentation.Jeff: But what is the tower site that we went to for the hot dogs?Joe: KHOJ? KHOJ, yeah. Those don't have lights. Those do not have lights.Jeff: Because they're under 200 feet.Joe: Yes, so they don't need lighting. So, and then they don't need painting either. So that's one of those things that, again, always refer to that because just because you have a tower that's under 200 feet doesn't mean you don't have to make sure it complies or you may have to paint it or you may have to light and paint.Tower painting has changed a lot over the years. The older towers have lead in them. So whenever there's a project on the tower, it's not unusual to see the guys in some kind of a, what do they call those?Jeff: A full ghillie suit? Or I don't know what they're called.Joe: Yeah. Yeah. So they have that too. So anyway, that's the bottom line from then till now.But some short towers  have lights...Jeff: So far, we've been talking about radio and TV towers, the ones that are really big. But what about little small towers? I know I see a lot of cell towers that don't have any lights at all, but sometimes they do. They just have one little light bulb on top. Or even if they're 50 to 100 feet tall, I've seen it sometimes.Joe: Yeah, and there's always a reason for seeing a light somewhere, almost always on structures, including buildings and so forth. But if you look around the area where you're seeing that tower that you know is not 200 feet and it's got a light on the top, look you're probably near an airport, a heliport, or somewhere where there's an aviation hazard. You know hospitals, they have their helipads there.So everywhere there is a possible hazard for flight for aircraft is going to have lights involved, and that's why we see a lot of buildings even have lights.Jeff: So it sounds like we have towers and even buildings that have to have lights put up but who's in charge of all this? Like if I'm going to put up my own tower, who do I need to talk to to make sure that i'm doing it right and get it approved?So that includes our broadcast towers, big chimney stacks, water towers, bridges, nuclear power plant cooling towers, wind turbines, tall electrical towers, you know, those ones that they cross a river, they'll have those extra tall ones with markings in the middle. Sometimes those are required to have lighting.And there are also rules that even apply during construction projects. So you've got these big buildings going up And you'll notice the cranes will have lights on them. And there's a spec for that, how many lights have to be on the crane, what height it has to be at.As you look around the next 12 months, look around at all those lights. You'll enjoy it like I do.Jeff: You'll look like a radio engineer once you know about these things!Estimating tower height by lightJeff: So that's made me think, like, looking through these instructions, I did find this page. And I thought, like, could you use tower lights, the number of them, as a way to judge how tall a tower is? Kind of a rough estimate.Joe: Yes, actually you can because the specifications, like for tall, these would apply to radio and TV towers. They require so many lights depending on the height.Like around here, we would have the F4 version with four lights, four blinking light levels, a light at the top if the antenna here at the top is higher than 40 feet.So you can kind of look and get an idea of whether you're looking at a 500-foot tower or a 1,000-foot tower. I don't think you could go like 700 versus 1,000 as easily.But you can tell, and the guys know. I know a couple of pilots that are also engineers or selling in radio business, and they can do that. They'll tell you, you know, like I was passing a tower. What's a tower that's a 1,200-foot tower doing out here? So it's pretty fun, and you go to this document has everything you need if you want to take the time and study that and memorize it and then fly.Monitoring and reporting outages (and NOTAMs)Jeff: One other thing that since we've been running this channel I keep getting emails about, if someone sees that there's lights out on a tower, like let's say it's nighttime and you're out there and you notice like one of these towers for the past few days hasn't had a light on, can you do anything about that? What should you do?Joe: Well, first of all, if it's required to be lit, every tower that's required to be lit is also required to be monitored.So in radio, we put a monitoring circuit on the electrical feed to the filaments and you can measure how much current is going through there, right? So you've got to monitor it. You've got to get alarmed by that. The alarm can call you or reach you. But you also have to call every day, check your circuit, your system, and make sure the lights are on. So if you only are lit at night, that means that call has to happen after it's dark.You've got to verify that your lighting is working, and you have to report it within 30 minutes. And you find that if a light's out, you've got to report it. And we call that a NOTAM, where the FAA puts it on a system that all the pilots can have access to. And they know that there's a tower there, but it's lights out. And they can use it in their flight planning.Jeff: You're an engineer and you have the tie-in with the FAA or whatever. But what would I be able to do if I did see a tower that was out?Joe: Well, you can do a NOTAM search. Try to look through and see if you see it. The other thing, you could contact the tower owner or the engineer at the site, the tower's engineer, and they can check into it. They should already know because they have their monitoring equipment, right?Joe: They should already know. They do.And then, of course, if you're out there, usually the tower, either on the tower or in the fencing around it or on the building, will have an ASR number, which identifies that tower to the FAA and the FCC, actually. But that number would be the exact tower that you'd be reporting.Jeff: So hopefully you learned a little bit more about why there are so many flashing lights around at night and not just for radio towers, but for bridges, buildings, and more. What other things do you want to know about towers? Let us know in the comments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside Gaza&apos;s &apos;Yellow Line&apos; as U.S. Weighs Plan to Split Enclave</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/skqnmoV7CzE</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/skqnmoV7CzE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:11:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WSJ’s Dov Lieber reports from Gaza as the U.S. considers a plan to divide it into separate zones, with reconstruction only taking place on the Israeli-controlled side.

Whether the US actually puts pen to paper (and all the reporting on this is kind of cagey) is almost beside the point—by showing up and legitimizing the proceeding, what the Biden administration last year blessed with “we’ll fix it from within” is now in the hands of the Trump administration. You know, the one that views criticism as crime and governmental power as something to maximize, not constrain. What could go wrong?The Russian-initiated treaty, which we’ve warned aboutmultiple times over the past few years, creates a framework for cross-border law enforcement “cooperation” on “cybercrime” that’s defined so broadly it could cover basically any activity a government doesn’t like that happens to involve a computer.As The Record notes, despite widespread concerns raised by plenty of people, the Biden administration felt it made more sense to sign onto this agreement in order to be able to fix it from within later:The White House later told reporters they felt theyhad to back the treaty now in order to make changes to it later and shape how it was implementedglobally. They also said it would likely expand the number of countries that will respond to warrants issued by the U.S. related to cybercrime.That’s… optimistic. And also completely backwards.That reasoning might work for a trade agreement where you’re negotiating tariff rates or dispute resolution procedures. But when the treaty is about creating a legal framework that explicitly empowers any government to demand data on anyone accused of a “serious crime” under their domestic law, you can’t shape your way out of that. The mechanism itself is the problem.You don’t fix a fundamentally broken treaty by signing it and hoping to shape implementation later. That’s not how it works. Once you’ve given your stamp of approval to a Russia-backed surveillance framework, you’ve already lost the game. The “we’ll fix it later” approach might have made some sense when there was at least a theoretical chance the US would push back against abuse. But now we’re handing these powers to an administration that has made clear it views any criticism as an attack, any dissent as a threat, and any check on its power as illegitimate.We, the undersigned organizations, remain deeply concerned that the UN Convention Against Cybercrime (UNCC) will facilitate human rights abuses across borders. As some states head to Hanoi for the UNCC signing ceremony from October 25-26, we urge them to refrain from signing and ratifying the treaty and to use the occasion to highlight the importance of safeguarding human rights when implementing this Convention.The problems with this treaty are extensive and we’ve covered them before, but they’re worth repeating given that they’re now officially going into effect. As Human Rights Watch details:The Convention will obligate governments to collect electronic evidence and share it with foreign authorities for any “serious crime,” defined as an offense punishable by at least four years of imprisonment under domestic law. Many governments criminalize activities protected by international human rights law and impose sentences that would make them “serious offenses” under this framework, such as criticism of the government,Think about that for a second (or more, because the more you think about it, the worse it seems). In Thailand, criticizing the king can get you fifteen years. In Russia, criticizing the invasion of Ukraine is considered “violence against police” or “incitement of hatred.” Under this treaty, those become legitimate grounds for demanding data from US companies about US users. And the safeguards against this? Basically non-existent.The treaty does include some language about respecting human rights in Article 6, but as we’ve noted before, it’s incredibly weak. It essentially says states should implement the treaty “consistent with their obligations under international human rights law” and that nothing in the treaty should be interpreted as “permitting suppression of human rights.”Great. Except every authoritarian government on earth claims their repressive laws are consistent with human rights. They just have a different interpretation of what those rights mean and when they can be restricted. Thailand says its lèse-majesté law protects “public security.” Russia says its laws against criticizing the military are necessary to protect national defense. Saudi Arabia’s laws against “defaming” the government are framed as protecting social stability.The treaty’s language does nothing to stop any of this. It’s a permission slip, not a constraint.And the Biden administration knew this last year. As The Record notes, the current State Department said it is “still reviewing the treaty” when asked whether the US will be among the first to ratify it. Which raises the obvious question: if you’re still reviewing whether it’s safe to ratify, why the hell did you join the signing ceremony?Now add a treaty that allows foreign governments to request surveillance data on anyone accused of a “serious crime” under their domestic law. And remember: the US appears to be supporting this framework. We’re telling the world that this is legitimate international cooperation.So when Viktor Orban’s Hungary decides that criticizing the government is a serious crime worthy of five years imprisonment, or when India decides that reporting on government corruption qualifies as sedition, or when any of dozens of increasingly authoritarian governments decide they want to track down dissidents who happen to use American tech platforms—they now have a treaty-backed framework to request that data.And what’s the Trump administration going to do? Push back on behalf of journalists and activists? Defend the principle that criticism of government shouldn’t be treated as a crime? Please.The Human Rights Watch statement is particularly pointed about the location of the signing ceremony:The signing ceremony in Hanoi is taking place against the backdrop of an intensified crackdown by the Vietnamese government on dissent to punish people simply for raising concerns or complaints about government policies or local officials, including online.So countries are literally signing a surveillance treaty in a country that’s actively cracking down on online dissent.The organizations opposing the treaty also make clear what should have been obvious from the start: you can’t fix this by signing it and hoping for the best. They urge states that are considering signing to withhold support unless they can guarantee meaningful safeguards will prevent abuse in practice.States should refuse to sign or ratify the Convention. States that have already committed to signing should adopt concrete human rights safeguards and demonstrate how these enable them to implement the Convention’s terms in a manner that fully respects human rights.Rights-respecting states that are considering signing the UNCC despite the significant threat it poses to human rights should withhold their support unless and until they can guarantee that certain conditions are in place, namely that they and other signatories will implement the treaty with meaningful safeguards and other legal protections that will prevent human rights abuses in practice.And they lay out what those safeguards would need to include: extensive stakeholder consultation, national frameworks that meet international human rights standards, formal reservations to ensure dual criminality requirements, transparency into implementation, and making human rights compliance a prerequisite for any funding or capacity building.None of that is in place. None of it is even being seriously discussed. Having the Biden administration bless this approach last year, and now the Trump admin show up to the signing ceremony basically takes away any and all leverage.There is no “later” for shaping implementation when you’ve already legitimized the framework. And there’s definitely no hope of the Trump administration using this treaty responsibly when they’ve made clear they view governmental power as something to be maximized, not constrained.The treaty required only 40 ratifications to enter into force, and it received 72, which sets off a 90-day clock until the treaty is official. In a better world, the US would make clear it will not be among those to sign or ratify the treaty. In theory, it still could. As various reports note, many of the big American tech companies also opposed this treaty.Now would be a good time for the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Marc Andreessen to use some of their connections with Trump to suggest he goes in another direction. But that seems unlikely.The Biden administration fucked this up big time last year by coming out in support of this treaty with a “we’ll help fix it from within later” approach. That we’re now having to hope someone convinces Trump to push back on it is less than ideal.This treaty is damaging and dangerous. The Biden administration gave it its initial blessing, and now the Trump administration is poised to help the world’s worst authoritarians abuse it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How desperation is fuelling deported migrants to reattempt Channel crossings</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/how-desperation-is-fuelling-deported-migrants-to-reattempt-channel-crossings</link><author>Darshna Soni</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:37:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Additional reporting by Maya Elese.It was billed as a “groundbreaking deal” and proof that Britain and France could finally cooperate to curb the record number of small-boat crossings across the Channel.The so-called one in, one out deal sounded straightforward: for every migrant deported from the UK to France, Britain would accept one asylum seeker through a new legal route.But when we travelled to Paris, the reality we found was far more complicated.The first to be sent backIn a hostel tucked behind a busy street on the outer edges of Paris, we met two young men among the first to be deported under the scheme. We’re calling them Abdul and Ali, which are not their real names to protect their identities.Abdul is from Yemen. He says he fled after being threatened by armed groups during the country’s civil war.“When we landed, we felt safe when we saw the British flag,” he told us.“But a few hours later, we were under detention.”Ali, from East Africa described his experience escaping conflict and persecution before reaching Calais and crossing the Channel.“My country is at war,” he said. “If I go back, I will be arrested or killed.”Both men say they were detained in the UK for nearly two months before being told that they would be returned to France. Both say they weren’t given a clear explanation about why they were selected.Now back in Paris, they say they’ve been left destitute and frightened, and told us they were already considering trying to reach Britain again.“They say France is safe,” Ali said. “But not for me.”In fact, we were told by a source, one of the first to be returned under the one in, one out deal, has since absconded from his accommodation in France. And an Iranian man who was also deported has already made it back to the UK via a small boat crossing.So far, 42 people have been returned to France under the scheme.What is the Dublin agreement?At the heart of their situation is a tangle of asylum law that few people outside Europe’s migration system fully understand.Under the EU’s Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers are supposed to have their claims processed in the first EU country they enter. That means that if someone’s fingerprints were first taken in, say, Italy or Greece, France can send them back there to claim asylum, even if they’re now living in Paris.The UK no longer participates in the Dublin system since Brexit, but France still does. And that has left people like Abdul and Ali in legal limbo – Britain won’t process their claims and France may not either.When the returns deal was unveiled in July, it came with political fanfare. Both governments framed it as proof that cooperation could reduce crossings and restore control.Yet it has already raised questions that neither side seems ready to answer.Who is being selected for deportation? What happens to them once they reach France? And can any deterrent really work, if those returned believe their only hope is to try again?Others we spoke to in Paris and northern France said they, too, plan to cross again, seeing it as a gamble worth taking in the hope they won’t be returned a second time.‘We will close every single asylum hotel’Back in Westminster, the Home Office insists the plan is working and that every return helps deter crossings and restore order to the asylum system.But on the streets of Paris, the human reality looks very different.For Abdul and Ali, this was never about policy or politics, it was about safety. Both told us they still see Britain as their only option.The one in, one out deal may have been designed to show control. But, for those caught up in it, it has meant more uncertainty and a growing sense that their journey isn’t over yet.Producer: Maya Elese, Alexander OhrnCamera/ Editor: Paul Mackeson]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>a16z Is Funding a &apos;Speedrun&apos; to AI-Generated Hell on Earth</title><link>https://www.404media.co/a16z-is-funding-a-speedrun-to-ai-generated-hell-on-earth/</link><author>Emanuel Maiberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/speedrun.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:15:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if your coworkers were AI?

Catastrophic flash flooding, landslides, and destructive winds will continue through today, causing widespread infrastructure damage, power and communication outages, and isolated communities. Total structural failure is possible near the path of Melissa’s center. Along the southern coast, life-threatening storm surge and damaging waves are expected through the day. Failure to act may result in serious injury or loss of life.”Why is Hurricane Melissa so bad?Hurricanes are common in the Caribbean at this time of year, so the region is used to having to prepare and deal with these powerful storms.However, what is making Hurricane Melissa even more impactful is that the storm is moving very slowly.Atlantic hurricanes typically move forward at 10-15mph. At one point, Melissa was stationary, and in the past few days has generally only been moving at a speed of 5mph or less.As a result, the storm has spent longer over warmer than average ocean water – allowing it to intensify rapidly.Additionally, a slower-moving storm means that the places hit experience torrential rain, extreme winds and a coastal storm surge for even longer – increasing the level of damage and destruction.The role of climate changeClimate change, mostly driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is continuing to warm our planet’s oceans and atmosphere.And while climate change isn’t altering the frequency of hurricanes, it is enabling those that form to intensify more quickly and produce higher wind speeds – when the right conditions come together.As Earth’s atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture – around 7% more for each 1-degree Celsius rise in global temperature. This allows hurricanes to produce greater amounts of rainfall, which worsens flooding and landslides.Rising sea levels are also increasing the risk to coastal communities from storm surges – where ocean water is pushed inland by a hurricane’s powerful winds.Where will Hurricane Melissa go next?After hitting Jamaica, Hurricane Melissa is expected to make a second landfall in eastern Cuba on Tuesday night as a category four storm.The storm is then likely to weaken a little and hit central parts of The Bahamas on Wednesday afternoon, before eventually moving close to Bermuda on Thursday night.As the storm moves northwards, its forward speed is going to increase. Nevertheless, it is still expected to leave a trail of destruction as it passes through.Although Hurricane Melissa will eventually fade by the end of the weekend, the impacts for those affected will last weeks, if not months.Hurricanes that have been extremely destructive have their associated names retired from use. There’s a reasonable chance that Melissa may end up being one of these.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mapping the off-target effects of every FDA-approved drug in existence</title><link>https://www.owlposting.com/p/mapping-the-off-target-effects-of</link><author>abhishaike</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:12:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Bill Busathis datasetCC-NA licensecomprehensive mapping of the interactions between a significant fraction of clinically important human cellular receptors and 1,600~ FDA-approved drugsIf you’d like to understand why I think it is useful, and what the dataset exactly contains, read on! what exactly an exogenous chemical is doing inside a body is not the point of the drug discovery process. With that background context, I am ready to present three claims I’m going to make in this essay and spend the remaining sections trying to prove:Understanding off-target effects is really useful.Learning about off-target effects at scale is possible.No for-profit institution has a strong incentive to do this work.For the moment, let’s accept that these three are indeed true, and we can put our skeptic hat back on at the end of this section.startupssomething I’ve written about in the pastand have been!map the off-target effects of every FDA-approved drug in existence and share the data.So why are they doing this? How will they do it? And why hasn’t anyone else done it yet? because we want to know if potential side effects of a drug exist: drug repurposing, validation for machine-learning models, which I have written about before as being a challenging propositionthose areas alone are extremely valuable. Yet, 30%~ of FDA-approved drugs gain a new post-approval indication,given that 38% of all prescriptions written in the US are off-label! Yet, 95% of its prescriptions usage are for pain; follow-up studies by PfizerYet, prescriptions for these ineffective off-label usages continue. phase 2 trials as a result of their already-collected toxicity data5 652 3But, as it stands today, most drug repurposing efforts are done somewhat blindly; haphazardly glancing through the literature, relying on anecdotal case reports, or waiting for some academic lab to publish a five-mouse study from 2013 that hints at a secondary use. In many ways, it isn’t too dissimilar to the usual drug-discovery process! Given how promising (and relatively limited) the list of FDA-approved drugs are, the simple act of a pre-triaged list of drug-target maps (EvE’s mission!) may be extraordinarily impactful.validate their machine-learning models predictions. ChEMBL BindingDB PubChem BioAssay We Need Better Benchmarks for Machine Learning in Drug DiscoveryThis is an area of EvE’s work that I cannot personally shed much light on, and obviously, Bill cannot tell me the exact details on what the commercial entities are working on. But it was a surprising learning from our conversation that this particular topic is where public interest is most rapidly coalescing! Very excited to hear about more public statements they make in this area soon.I do think this is the weakest, day-one value-add for EvE’s dataset. So take this section with a grain of salt! It just felt too interesting to not cover.13.7% weight loss with Ozempic, 20.2% weight loss with Zepboundwith early phase 2 results looking once again promising. ~17% of all adults in the US meet the definition for polypharmacy One study estimates that10% of hospital admissions among older adultsThe solution may very well be to bundle things up.But the obvious question: does EvE’s dataset help with polypharmacology efforts? There isn’t any current, empirical proof of this, but I think it will. If you squint, you could see it functioning as missing infrastructure, a dataset that is necessary for rational polypharmacology to occur at scale. But this is necessarily tied up with machine-learning for chemical design accelerating, so, again, this is not necessarily something I’d expect EvE’s work to contribute to by the end of the year. But perhaps soon!This all said, even if you agreed that the value proposition that EvE is claiming is real, you may struggle to verbalize exactly how you would understand the off-target effects of the 13,000~ FDA approved drugs out there. What assays would you use? How do you dose any given drug? How do you understand the translation of your assay to real-world settings?Let’s walk through the EvE workflow.First, you need to decide what drugs you're actually going to test. While there are technically around 13,000 FDA-approved drugs out there, many of them aren't particularly relevant for this kind of screening. You can immediately exclude things like topical medications, inhalants, radioisotopes, and simple nutrients, stuff that is known to be largely innocuous or not have much systemic impact. After this initial filtering, you end up with about 1,600 small molecule drugs that are worth investigating. But this number gets further whittled down further based on practical constraints; availability, cost, licensing requirements, etc.From this, EvE ended up with a library of 1,397 compounds to screen.(everything x everything)And, indeed, that turns out to be the case.7-transmembrane receptors (also known as GPCRs).  110 GPCR’s 12-13 NR’s 56 GPCR’s and 29 NR’sThey hope to do much more than this too, but we’ll cover that in the last section. 13% of FDA-approved drugs target NR’s 35% for GPCR’sTR-FRET-based co-factor recruitment assays for NRs. These co-factors tend to have little peptide motifs (like an LXXLL motif) that latch onto that domain.If the FDA-approved drug is an agonist, you’ll see a spike of light appear as the two fluorophores interact.Tango β-arrestin recruitment assays for 7TMs/GPCRs G-proteins β-arrestinThe stronger the GPCR activation by a drug, the more β-lactamase is produced, the more substrate is cleaved, and the bigger the fluorescence shift.That shift, measured as a ratio between ‘starting’ and ‘ending’ wavelengths, serves as a readout of how strongly the receptor was activated.Reasonably simple! One note: the explanations I gave above is for assessing the difference between an inactive drug and an agonist. For assessing inactive versus antagonist, a separate experiment is run with a known ligand included.EvE solves this in a pragmatic way: run a third assay which measures how healthy the cell isSo they run these three assays across their pairwise (drug x receptor) combinations, producing readouts at multiple different concentrations with replicates for each one. detailed here in Fig 7And…that’s it. A clean, rigorous, and tractable approach to understanding off-target effects, across hundreds of receptors, at multiple concentrations, using multiple modes of detection, with full transparency around the data.237,490 (drug x concentration x receptor) combinations have been screened, revealing 8 median agonists and 31 median antagonists per target.  Data dumps of the data started in November 2024, with new ones dropping every few months.I haven’t worked in a wet lab before, but I’ve been assured by at least one person I trust that the effort that went into assembling this all together is nothing short of extraordinary. But it is worth asking the question… why wasn’t this done a decade back?In some cases, the answer is boring: the technology wasn’t there yet to achieve it. at least since 2008 since 2010but is that true for big pharma? referencing this paper:The report’s authors, luminaries in the discipline of safety pharmacology, surveyed 18 major pharmaceutical companies regarding the numbers and identities of potential off-targets against which they test each and every one of their new drug candidates in the interest of safety. The numbers ranged from a low of 11 to a high of 104 potential off-targets routinely profiled per company, with a median of about 45. Interestingly, the industry’s opinions regarding which potential off-targets to screen vary widely. The total number of potential off-targets screened, across the universe of all 18 pharmas, was 763, yet only 12% of them were screened by more than a third of those companies.Novartis, who presented data collected “over a multi-year period” profiling drug/target interactions across a median of about 800 drugs per target and 105 gene product targets…it is better for everyone if such a dataset is collected using a single, standardized protocol instead of compiled from unrelated experiments over years.I asked Bill exactly this question, and the answer was a two-parter.A logical conclusion of this is that nearly every receptor covered in these sorts of screens is a safety-oriented receptor Indeed, the vast majority of screened receptors lie within the so-called Bowes-44 set 2012 paper that identified 44 receptors known to be often implicated in safety-related drug failures.alphaEvE is still quite young, just over 2 years old, and I think the future of it is going to look really, really crazy. At the end of my startup coverage articles, I typically focus on commercial/scientific risks. But given that EvE is assured funding on a multi-year horizon without needing to care about market demands, it may be much more instructive (and interesting!) to instead discuss their upcoming plans.I was astonished to learn that he expected to have released the remainder of all GPCR + NR screens dataset by the end of this year.Then what? Bill said he’s open to exploring even more drug targets, but he also said, surprisingly, that EvE may add more chemicals on top of the 1,600~ planned FDA-approved drugs. The FDA-approved drugs, he said, are success stories. Potentially it’d be even more interesting to consider the failures as well. Especially the ones that everybody expected to work, arrived at phase 3, and set billions of dollars on fire after the trial results came out. most secondary pharmacology work stops at the parent compound NAPQI An ACS page has this to say about it:While tool compounds have tremendous potential for advancing life science research, they are broadly defined, and it is often difficult for a researcher to determine the best tool compounds to employ during the research process. There remains a great need for more tool compound databases and authoritative sources of information from experts in the field.And, as always, there is a (very short) Derek Lowe piece smart people in biology should do more boring things.here]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI data suggests 1 million users discuss suicide with ChatGPT weekly</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-data-suggests-1-million-users-discuss-suicide-with-chatgpt-weekly/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/robot_therapy_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:11:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT is a gigantic statistical web of data relationships.

This can dramatically change how the animation feels.Bézier curves are great, but there are certain things they just can’t do. For example:In the past, we’ve needed to rely on JavaScript libraries to provide these sorts of interpolations, which introduces a whole bunch of trade-offs; most JavaScript animations run on the main thread, for example, which means they won’t run smoothly if other stuff is happening in our application!Fortunately, modern CSS has provided us a new tool that enables us to create springs, bounces, and so much more all in native CSS: the  timing function. In this blog post, I’ll show you how it works, and share some tools you can use to get started right away!The core idea here is surprisingly simple: instead of using mathematically-derived Bézier curves, we can instead draw the easing curve we want, by specifying a set of individual points on a cartesian plane.For example, this graph approximates an “ease” curve using 11 points:This  like a curve, but if you look closely, you’ll notice that it’s actually a bunch of straight line segments. It’s like those “connect the dots” drawings, where a shape emerges from a bunch of straight lines.This is why they named it “linear()”. Unlike Bézier curves, which are actual mathematical curves, the  function only draws straight lines between a set of provided points.Here’s what the actual CSS looks like for the  animation graphed above:The  function takes a set of numbers, with 0 representing the starting value and 1 representing the final value. We can think of this as a ratio of the transition progress. We can pass as many numbers as we want, and they’ll all be evenly-spaced across the specified duration.We can use  to emulate spring physics, capturing the data from a real modeled spring. Let’s suppose we’re trying to recreate this springy motion:Just for fun, I did my best to trace that springy shape by hand, guesstimating 11 values based on that graph. Here’s what that looks like:Yikes. This does not feel great. 😂We’ll look at how to make it better, but first, here’s the code for this not-great animation:Like with Bézier curves, the  function allows us to pick values outside the 0 to 1 range, to  the target like springs do. So that second value, , means that we’ve overshot the target location by 25%.The problem is that 11 values are just not enough to faithfully reproduce a springy value like this. The element is clearly moving robotically between discrete points rather than smoothly oscillating like a spring.But if we crank up the number of points, the simulation becomes much more believable. I wrote some code to calculate the values for  and here’s the result:Much more convincing, right?As you can tell from my failed experiment above, we aren’t really meant to write these  datasets by hand. Instead, we should use tools that dynamically calculate them for us.The best tool I’ve seen is Linear() Easing, by Jake Archibald and Adam Argyle. It comes pre-loaded with all of the math required to convert spring parameters into a highly-optimized  string, and if you have another JS-based timing function, you can easily edit the code to use that instead!There’s also Easing, which is the most comprehensive and nicely-designed tool I’ve found. It uses  to model springs, bounces, wiggles, and more, and provides a bunch of tools to test out your timing functions.Both of these tools take advantage of a more-advanced syntax for the  timing function. In addition to the progress ratio, certain points also have a time percentage:Like before, we have a list of progress ratios from 0 to 1 (or beyond, for overshooting). Most of these points also have a second value, a percentage. This controls where each point is placed in time. So, rather than having a bunch of evenly-spaced values, we can position them strategically, to achieve the same curve with a smaller # of points.For example, we can model that same spring with only 25 points, instead of 50:Honestly, I’m not sure that this is  much of a savings in terms of kilobytes; we use a smaller # of points, but each point requires two pieces of information instead of just one. Either way, both of the recommended tools use this syntax, so presumably they’ve found that it’s beneficial!We’ll talk more about the performance implications shortly.The  function is a lovely API that greatly expands what we can do in vanilla CSS, but like everything, there are some tradeoffs and limitations worth considering.When using JavaScript libraries that implement physics-based animations like springs or bounces, we don’t specify an animation . Instead, we configure our animation using physical properties like stiffness, damping, and mass. The animation takes however long it takes based on the physics.That’s not how CSS transitions work, though. CSS transitions require a duration:The Linear() Easing Generator solves this by dynamically deriving a duration based on the provided spring settings. The duration is calculated based on how much time is necessary until the spring settles down and stops moving.This works in  cases, but it means we can’t model a zero-friction spring. When we set “damping” to , the spring  oscillate forever, but there’s no such thing as an infinite-duration transition.Easing works a bit differently: “duration” is a user-configurable parameter, and it doesn’t recalculate as we adjust the spring settings. To make this work, Easing Wizard fudges the numbers a bit. Certain parameters are internally clamped, so that they won’t produce impossible curves.For example, with low mass/stiffness, damping has little to no effect, which is definitely not how it should work. 😅I prefer the solution that Jake/Adam came up with for Linear() Easing Generator, but really, there is no perfect solution here. Springs aren’t meant to be time-based, so it feels a bit like trying to come up with the best way to stuff a square peg into a round hole. It’s an awkward way to think about physics-based animation.One of the hardest problems in web animation is dealing with interrupts. The web is a dynamic place, and there’s no guarantee that an element will be allowed to complete its transition. Sometimes, it’ll be updated halfway through. What should happen in that case?Well, let’s give it a shot. This demo implements the same basic transition using the  function as well as React Spring, a library based around JavaScript spring physics. Click the button quickly, to interrupt the transition:If you click the button twice, very quickly, you should see something like this:(If you’re not able to click that quickly, you can also focus the button and press "Enter" twice.)When both animations run without interruption, they appear nearly identical. But if we trigger the button again mid-transition, they behave  differently.Here’s the fundamental difference: the version using React Spring takes the element’s  into account. It takes a moment to slow down, before swinging back in the opposite direction. The CSS version, by contrast, turns around instantly, as though it hit a wall.And the CSS version’s behaviour feels unnatural. This spring is meant to be pretty loose and smooth, but on that rebound transition, it feels tight and quick. 🤔The reason this happens is a bit complicated, and too much of a rabbit hole to get into here. To summarize at a high level, CSS transitions have special for handling interrupts. There’s a concept in the specification called the reversing shortening factor that proportionally reduces the duration of interrupted transitions. So, a spring intended to take 1600ms might re-run at only 400ms. This looks fine with Bézier curves, but we’re trying to emulate physics here, and we can’t just speed it up and expect it to feel natural.It’s a bit like taking a recording of someone walking at a leisurely pace, speeding it up by 2x, and trying to pass it off as someone jogging. The speed might be correct, but it sure as heck won’t look natural!In order to convincingly simulate a spring using , we need  of data points. It’s not uncommon for my springs to have 40+ data points!It  like this could have a significant impact on performance, but I wasn’t sure. And whenever I’m not sure about something like this, I try to figure it out with some testing.Is the framerate affected by complex  values?Does it balloon the size of my CSS bundles?The first concern was easy to test. I created a basic animation and tested two different  strings. The first string was the simplest possible value, . The second string had >100 values.Both animations ran equally smoothly, even on low-end hardware. I could not detect even a small difference between the two approaches. 👍For the second concern, I created 3 maximum-accuracy springs with Easing Wizard, with an average of 75 values each, and added them to the CSS for my course platform. It’s important to test things like this in the context of a real application.Here are the resulting file sizes:By default, my CSS bundle is 63.3kB, which compresses to 10.2kB with gzip.With these extra springs, my CSS bundle grew to 67.1kB, which compresses to 11.5kB with gzip.So, in this particular context, these 3 very-large springs added ~1.3kB to my CSS bundle.To put that number in context: on a typical 3G connection (2mb/s), it will take 5ms (0.005 seconds) to download this extra chunk of CSS. It will also add some processing time on the device, but we’re still talking about a completely imperceptible amount of time.Now, this assumes we only have 3  chunks in the entire bundle. If you copy/paste this large string for every animation, you could wind up with dozens of copies, so it’s a good idea to use CSS variables to reuse the same  timing function in multiple places. Let’s talk about how to do that! strings tend to be big and unwieldy. In addition to the potential performance concerns, it’s also just kind of annoying to work with them!Rather than sprinkle  values across the codebase, I recommend storing a handful of common timing functions in globally-available CSS variables. If you already have a system for design tokens, I think it’s a great idea to extend it with some  timing functions!We also need to consider browser support. As I mentioned earlier,  is a somewhat-new feature, and isn’t available in all browsers.Over the past few months, I’ve been experimenting with how to use these timing functions effectively. Here’s the pattern I’ve landed on:If the user is using an older browser which doesn't support , we’ll provide a fallback transition using Bézier curves. You can use Easing to come up with something that still feels alright (we can  mimic springs using Bézier curves by overshooting the target; it doesn’t look anywhere near as smooth, but it’s a decent fallback option).The  at-rule allows us to specify extra CSS in supported browsers. So, we overwrite  with the actual  value. I also like to record the stiffness/damping for springs in a comment, so that if I want to adjust the spring settings in the future, I remember how to reconstruct this  string. And finally, I add  to stop the Prettier formatter from putting each point on its own line, and turning this 1-line declaration into a 50-line list of numbers.We can then use the  and  variables wherever we typically apply transitions or keyframe animations. Like with all animations, we should make sure to respect user motion preferences. I write more about the “prefers-reduced-motion” media query in my blog post, Accessible Animations in React (this post is mainly for React devs, but the first half of the post should still be useful for all web developers!).For the past year, I’ve been working on the ultimate animations course. ✨In this course, we use modern CSS features like  alongside JavaScript, SVG, and Canvas to create top-tier whimsical animations and interactions. I share all of the tips and tricks I’ve learned after nearly two decades of experience.I’m hoping to release this course in the first half of 2026.

And it should have—not because it caught them off guard, but because it reveals everything wrong with what passes for journalistic sophistication in our moment.Let’s be precise about what Weiss is doing. She’s not asking whether  is actually biased. She’s not evaluating their coverage against standards of accuracy, fairness, or adherence to facts. She’s asking why “the country”  bias—which treats that perception as fact requiring accommodation regardless of whether the perception corresponds to reality.This is false balance perfected. The sophisticated move that treats “Trump and his allies say you’re biased” as equivalent evidence to actual journalistic practice. The epistemic surrender that makes public opinion—shaped by coordinated disinformation campaigns, algorithmic manipulation, and deliberate attacks on legitimate journalism—into the arbiter of what counts as fair coverage.When the President calls judicial review “insurrection,” when his advisers threaten to ignore court rulings, when federal agents conduct warrantless mass detentions— covering these facts isn’t bias. It’s journalism. And when Trump and his allies attack that coverage as partisan, the proper response isn’t “how do we address these perceptions?” It’s “we report what’s happening.”But Weiss has built a career on reframing accommodation as courage. Her brand rests on the premise that mainstream journalism, academia, and cultural institutions have been captured by the left and need correction toward “balance.” This framework treats asymmetric reality as if it were symmetric controversy—and what the reports about her first weeks at  reveals how this plays out in practice.She’s reportedly personally booking Netanyahu, Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff—architects of Trump’s Middle East policy—while urging executives to identify newsroom leakers. And she’s asking a newsroom that views itself as nonpartisan to justify why coordinated attacks on them have gained traction. She’s not asking whether Netanyahu’s government has committed actions worthy of critical coverage or whether Trump’s peace plan deserves scrutiny beyond its architects’ preferred framing—she’s ensuring powerful right-wing figures get platforms while shifting the burden from those making false claims to those reporting facts.This matters because even journalists who genuinely believe they’re defending fairness can fall into this trap. The frame is seductive: “Both sides claim bias, therefore the truth must be somewhere in the middle.” But this only works when both sides operate in good faith. When one side systematically attacks any accountability journalism as partisan while the other tries to report accurately, splitting the difference doesn’t produce balance—it produces capitulation.The question “why does the country think you’re biased?” does something structurally insidious regardless of Weiss’s intentions. It treats coordinated attacks on legitimate journalism as evidence requiring response rather than as bad-faith manipulation requiring exposure. It makes perceived bias—manufactured through deliberate campaigns—into a problem journalism must solve by changing coverage rather than a weapon journalism must resist by maintaining standards.The danger isn’t that journalists become propagandists overnight—it’s that they internalize propaganda’s logic while believing they’re protecting neutrality.This is precisely how authoritarian movements capture journalism without needing to shut it down. You don’t need to close newspapers when you can convince editors that “balance” means giving equal weight to demonstrable lies and documented facts. You don’t need to jail journalists when you can make them internalize the frame that reporting what’s actually happening is “partisan” if it makes one side look bad.The  staff should have answered her question directly: “The country thinks we’re biased because a coordinated disinformation infrastructure has spent decades attacking any journalism that holds Republican power accountable as ‘liberal media bias,’ and you’re now amplifying that frame by treating their attacks as legitimate concerns requiring our accommodation rather than as bad-faith manipulation requiring our resistance.”But they sat in stunned silence instead. Because Weiss is now their boss. And her early choices clarify what she values: access to powerful right-wing newsmakers, concern about perceptions shaped by those attacking journalism, and the sophisticated frame that treats “both sides say the other is biased” as evidence requiring split-the-difference coverage.This is how journalism dies. Not through crude censorship but through sophisticated editors who convince themselves that accommodation of authoritarian narratives is “balance,” that platforming power without sufficient scrutiny is “access,” that treating coordinated attacks as legitimate criticism is “taking concerns seriously.”Two plus two equals four. Federal agents conducting warrantless mass detentions violates the Fourth Amendment. Stephen Miller calling judicial review “insurrection” is authoritarian rejection of constitutional governance. Covering these facts is journalism. Treating coverage of these facts as evidence of bias is surrender.Bari Weiss is editor-in-chief of . And her first major act was asking the network’s flagship program to justify why they’re perceived as biased for doing their jobs. That tells you everything about what she’ll demand they stop doing—and why her version of “balance” is just authoritarianism with better branding.Mike Brock is a former tech exec who was on the leadership team at Block.

More and more families and schools are setting clear boundaries to counter the constant distraction of social media.

Studies have linked excessive smartphone use to depression, anxiety, and difficulties concentrating. This documentary follows several families and schools that greatly restrict smartphone use for children and young people. Martin and Ursula Novotny in Sevelen, Switzerland, are convinced that phones and social media are just as addictive as alcohol or drugs. They waited until their children were older before giving them a cell phone of their own. The Lyceum Alpinum boarding school in Switzerland is equally strict: During the day, all devices remain locked away; older students get their cell phones back after class, while younger students only get them for two hours in the evening. The result: The children are significantly less distracted in class and have actual conversations at breaktime. How much screen time is healthy, and at what age does it make sense to give a child a smartphone? Child and adolescent psychotherapist Nady Mirian explains which parental rules work for social media. The schools and families featured in the documentary are not opposed to new technologies, but they advocate responsible use. Is it still realistic for children today to grow up without a smartphone — and could it actually be preferable?

Somewhere near the top was a post called “TIL in 2002 a cave diver committed suicide by stabbing himself during a cave diving trip near Split, Croatia. Due to the nature of his death, it was initially investigated as a homicide, but it was later revealed that he had done it while lost in the underwater cave to avoid the pain of drowning.” The post linked to a Wikipedia page called “List of unusual deaths in the 21st century.” I spent the next two hours falling into a Wikipedia rabbit hole, clicking through all manner of horrifying and difficult-to-imagine ways to die.A day later, I saw that Depths of Wikipedia, the incredible social media account run by Annie Rauwerda, had noted the entirely unsurprising fact that, behind the scenes, there had been robust conversation and debate by Wikipedia editors as to exactly what constitutes an “unusual” death, and that several previously listed “unusual” deaths had been deleted from the list for not being weird enough. For example: People who had been speared to death with beach umbrellas are “no longer an unusual or unique occurrence”; “hippos are extremely dangerous and very aggressive and there is nothing unusual about hippos killing people”; “mysterious circumstances doesn’t mean her death itself was unusual.” These are the types of edits and conversations that have collectively happened billions of times that make Wikipedia what it is, and which make it so human, so interesting, so useful. Wednesday, as part of his ongoing war against Wikipedia because he does not like his page, Elon Musk launched Grokipedia, a fully AI-generated “encyclopedia” that serves no one and nothing other than the ego of the world’s richest man. As others have already pointed out, Grokipedia seeks to be a right wing, anti-woke Wikipedia competitor. But to even call it a Wikipedia competitor is to give the half-assed project too much credit. It is not a Wikipedia “competitor” at all. It is a fully robotic, heartless regurgitation machine that cynically and indiscriminately sucks up the work of humanity to serve the interests, protect the ego, amplify the viewpoints, and further enrich the world’s wealthiest man. It is a totem of what Wikipedia could and would become if you were to strip all the humans out and hand it over to a robot; in that sense, Grokipedia is a useful warning because of the constant pressure and attacks by AI slop purveyors to push AI-generated content into Wikipedia. And it is only getting attention, of course, because Elon Musk does represent an actual threat to Wikipedia through his political power, wealth, and obsession with the website, as well as the fact that he owns a huge social media platform.One needs only spend a few minutes clicking around the launch version of Grokipedia to understand that it lacks the human touch that makes Wikipedia such a valuable resource. Besides often having a conservative slant and having the general hallmarks of AI writing, Grokipedia pages are overly long, poorly and confusingly organized, have no internal linking, have no photos, and are generally not written in a way that makes any sense. There is zero insight into how any of the articles were generated, how information was obtained and ordered, any edits that were made, no version history, etc. Grokipedia is, literally, simply a single black box LLM’s version of an encyclopedia. There is a reason Wikipedia editors are called “editors” and it’s because writing a useful encyclopedia entry does not mean “putting down random facts in no discernible order.” To use an example I noticed from simply clicking around: The list of “notable people” in the Grokipedia entry for Baltimore begins with a disordered list of recent mayors, perhaps the least interesting but lowest hanging fruit type of data scraping about a place that could be done. On even the lowest of stakes Wikipedia pages, real humans with real taste and real thoughts and real perspectives discuss and debate the types of information that should be included in any given article, in what order it should be presented, and the specific language that should be used. They do this under a framework of byzantine rules that have been battle tested and debated through millions of edit wars, virtual community meetings, talk page discussions, conference meetings, inscrutable listservs which themselves have been informed by Wikimedia’s “mission statement,” the “Wikimedia values,” its “founding principles” and  and tons of other stated and unstated rules, norms, processes and procedures. All of this behind-the-scenes legwork is essentially invisible to the user but is very serious business to the human editors building and protecting Wikipedia and its related projects (the high cultural barrier to entry for editors is also why it is difficult to find new editors for Wikipedia, and is something that the Wikipedia community is always discussing how they can fix without ruining the project). Any given Wikipedia page has been stress tested by actual humans who are discussing, for example, whether it’s actually that unusual to get speared to death by a beach umbrella.Grokipedia, meanwhile, looks like what you would get if you told an LLM to go make an anti-woke encyclopedia, which is essentially exactly what Elon Musk did. As LLMs tend to do, some pages on Grokipedia leak part of its instructions. For example, a Grokipedia page on “Spanish Wikipedia” notes “Wait, no, can’t cite Wiki,” indicating that Grokipedia has been programmed to not link to Wikipedia. That entry does cite Wikimedia pages anyway, but in the “sources,” those pages are not actually hyperlinked: I have no doubt that Grokipedia will fail, like other attempts to “compete” with Wikipedia or build an “alternative” to Wikipedia, the likes of which no one has heard of because the attempts were all so laughable and poorly participated in that they died almost immediately. Grokipedia isn’t really a competitor at all, because it is everything that Wikipedia is not: It is not an encyclopedia, it is not transparent, it is not human, it is not a nonprofit, it is not collaborative or crowdsourced, in fact, it is not really edited at all. It is true that Wikipedia is under attack from both powerful political figures, the proliferation of AI, and related structural changes to discoverability and linking on the internet like AI summaries and knowledge panels. But Wikipedia has proven itself to be incredibly resilient because it is a project that specifically leans into the shared wisdom and collaboration of humanity, our shared weirdness and ways of processing information. That is something that an LLM will never be able to compete with. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Acho: &apos;Once You See It, You Can Be It&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/urHyPgt9sho</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/urHyPgt9sho?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:32:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Once you see it, you can be it.”

When he pulled out his wallet, the agent “snatched” it and took his ID without asking questions, Ramírez said.“It was clear to me the agents did not know who I was,” Ramírez, 64, said in a court filing translated from Spanish. “They did not show me any document or have a warrant for me.”He was among 78 people arrested during an immigration enforcement mission, “Operation Return to Sender,” carried out less than two weeks before Donald Trump returned to the White House.Note the date: January 7. Trump had already been elected but was not yet in office. That would be the other person Bovino is willing to answer to, even if that person isn’t actually his boss at that point in time. Bovino launched “Return to Sender,” the mission to California’s Central Valley earlier this year, without approval from the Biden administration, the Atlantic magazine reported.[A] CalMatters investigation, in partnership with Evident and Bellingcat, found that Border Patrol officials misrepresented the very basics of their high-profile, large-scale immigration raid. Data obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection reveal that Border Patrol had no prior knowledge of criminal or immigration history for 77 of the 78 people arrested. In a spreadsheet provided by the agency, under “Criminal History,” all but one entry contains the following passage: “Criminal and/or immigration history was not known prior to the encounter.”Bovino is now in Chicago, far from the southern border he’s used to patrolling. But he’s still the same old Bovino — an asshat with a bad haircut who thinks no one can tell him what to do, not even federal court judges.After plaintiffs secured a restraining order restricting the use of crowd control projectiles against people engaged in protected speech, Bovino immediately ensured the court order was violated. And he decided he should be the person to do it. The court order said tear gas couldn’t be used until after clear orders to disperse had been ignored. Bovino said fuck it and hurled tear gas into a peaceful crowd that had done nothing more than stand a few feet away from Bovino and other immigration enforcement officers. That’s from the filing [PDF] submitted by the plaintiffs, asking Judge Sara Ellis to take note of this blatant violation of her court order. And if you don’t care for still photos, here’s a recording of Bovino violating the court order: U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis ordered Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who has led a series of increasingly aggressive raids across Chicago and the suburbs, to appear in her courtroom in person at 10 a.m. Tuesday.Ellis’ order came less than 24 hours after Bovino fired tear gas at a crowd during an aggressive raid in Little Village. Bovino accompanied agents on raids in Little Village Wednesday and Thursday.But we’ll have to wait and see how this will play out. Bovino certainly acts like he’s above the law. Not only that, he  to  that he’s above the law. First, he insulted the judge. And then he basically said he’d continue to ignore court orders because they’re not the boss of him (paraphrasing). This is from the same filing that includes the screenshot of Bovino’s tear gas tossing:[M]ultiple declarants and numerous video clips demonstrate that the crowd in Little Village was peaceful at the moment Defendant Bovino started the conflict by launching cannisters of tear gas into the assembled crowd, and that no warnings or dispersal orders were given before he did so.Following the incident, Defendant Bovino was interviewed by a reporter. In that interview, Defendant Bovino appears uninjured. He says in response to questions words to the effect of, “Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head by a rock like I did this morning?” Defendant Bovino continues saying something like, “maybe she needs to see what that’s like before she gives an order like that.”The filing notes Bovino does not appear to be injured. And the government hasn’t filed any declaration backing Bovino’s claims. But that’s not all Bovino said during that interview. He literally stated he was not obligated to follow orders given by federal courts: In that same interview discussed above, Defendant Bovino also stated, “I take my orders from the executive branch,” suggesting disdain for this Court’s authority to enjoin his unlawful conduct.Asked whether firing from elevated positions or above the waist violates DHS policy, Bovino insisted, “It doesn’t matter where you fire from … that is a less lethal device for area saturation.” As for shots striking protesters above the waist, he said, “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them. Don’t protest and don’t trespass.“OK. That’s fucked up. This is a grown-ass man using a rhetorical device most famously deployed by two elementary school students in a cartoon. Worse, Bovino isn’t going to wait for people to “stray” into the line of his unlawful fire. He and his boys are going to instigate violence and reverse engineer justifications for their actions. As the filing notes, the DHS claimed a “mob” surrounded officers and threw projectiles, including “commercial artillery shell fireworks.” The lawyers handling this case don’t mince words when responding to the government’s assertions: If Bovino bothers to show up in court, there will be plenty more of those. Given this inevitability, courts need to consider engaging in extreme measures to ensure compliance. The “presumption of regularity” no longer exists under Trump. The entire administration has demonstrated it believes it answers to no one — an internal rot that has infected everything it touches. In the past, people like Bovino would be considered aberrations: rogue officials in need of a good firing. These days, Bovino is the rule, rather than the exception. And this nation’s courts need to respond to this “new normal” accordingly. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft&apos;s Azure Linux 3.0.20251021 Pulls In AppArmor &amp; Other Updates</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Azure-Linux-3.0.20251021</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:05:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft today released Azure Linux 3.0.20251021 as the latest update to their in-house Linux distribution...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Research Hacker News, ArXiv &amp; Google with Hierarchical Bayesian Models</title><link>https://sturdystatistics.com/deepdive-search</link><author>kianN</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 15:49:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rogue Goodreads Librarian Edits Site to Expose &apos;Censorship in Favor of Trump Fascism’</title><link>https://www.404media.co/rogue-goodreads-librarian-edits-site-to-expose-censorship-in-favor-of-trump-fascism/</link><author>Matthew Gault</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/Copy-of-Screenshot-as-Lede-Image--5--1.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 15:45:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Friday morning, Goodreads users who wanted to read reviews of the werewolf romance  were confronted by the cover of the new Eric Trump book .

The deal values Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI at approximately $135 billion and extends the exclusive partnership through 2032 while giving both companies more freedom to pursue AGI independently.The partnership began in 2019 when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI. Since then, Microsoft has provided billions in cloud computing resources through Azure and used OpenAI’s models as the basis of products like Copilot. The new agreement maintains Microsoft as OpenAI’s frontier model partner and preserves Microsoft’s exclusive rights to OpenAI’s IP and Azure API exclusivity until the threshold of AGI is reached.Under a previous arrangement, OpenAI alone would determine when it achieved AGI, which is a nebulous concept that is difficult to define. The revised deal requires an independent expert panel to verify that claim, a change that adds oversight to a determination with billions of dollars at stake. When the panel confirms that AGI has been reached, Microsoft’s intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s research methods will expire, and the revenue-sharing arrangement between the companies will end, though payments will continue over a longer period.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jimo Borjigin: Do Near-Death Experiences Prove an Afterlife? | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYs2c5BgjU</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lwYs2c5BgjU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 15:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more CTT Chats here: https://t.ly/jJI7e

What actually happens in the brain during a near-death experience? Neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin shares groundbreaking research that reveals dramatic surges in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the moments before death. These chemical floods may explain the feelings of euphoria, tunnels of light, and out-of-body sensations reported by millions. Is this evidence of the afterlife—or proof that the dying brain creates its own final visions?

--

Long ago, a temple was built near the site of a naval battle that concluded the long and gruesome conflict known as the Genpei Wars. For centuries after, performers throughout the country honored this tragic past in beautiful, haunting performances. But the most skilled storyteller of all was a monk from this very temple. Jeffrey Angles digs into the Japanese legend of Hōichi the earless.

And unfortunately has proven reasonably successful.“They get a pat on the back for being at these talks, and they get sort of the worst acts, not forgiven, but certainly explained away, through bureaucratic, dull bureaucratic talk.”“They (RSF) get a pat on the back for being at these talks, and they get sort of the worst acts, not forgiven, but certainly explained away, through bureaucratic, dull bureaucratic talk.”The UN has called for an immediate ceasefire throughout Sudan, and has said humanitarian access must be allowed to reach all civilians in need.Ms Khair said a humanitarian pause “would be useful” with 260,000 people, half of them children, still in El-Fasher, according to the UN, but “neither the Sudanese Armed Forces nor the RSF have shown any indication of will to have a humanitarian force to commit to a humanitarian pause anytime soon.“Neither the Sudanese Armed Forces nor the RSF have shown any indication of will to have a humanitarian force to commit to a humanitarian pause anytime soon.”“There’s no sense that actually the army and the RSF can command their allied militias to stop the fighting.. This is a multi-systemic conflict that is only really being dealt with at the international level on one level.”She called the call “poorly timed diplomacy that brings not enough leverage on the table to really get these two sides to commit to a ceasefire”.Ms Khair told Krishnan Guru-Murthy: “The Sudanese Armed Forces have been fighting wars mostly against the people of Sudan for decades. And starvation, siege, et cetera, these are the hallmarks of the warfare that they’ve been fighting.“And the RSF is, as a former partner to the Sudanese Armed Forces, carrying out exactly the kind of violence that they carried out together 20 years ago during the Darfur genocide.“We’re seeing this all effectively culminate in a war against civilians where it’s civilians that are really being harmed by the conflict, rather than the two armed sides.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hurricane Melissa approaches Jamaica as strongest storm of the year</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/hurricane-melissa-approaches-jamaica-as-strongest-storm-of-the-year</link><author>Channel 4 News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 14:38:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hurricane Melissa is the strongest storm of 2025 and it is slowly approaching Jamaica.People are hurriedly making last minute preparations and thousands have been evacuated as it is expected the storm will cause widespread flooding, landslides and extensive damage across the island.Along with 175mph wind gusts, Jamaica could be hit with up to a metre of rain and storm surges of up to four metres.But despite the government urging people to evacuate to emergency shelters, many Jamaicans have refused to leave their homes.

DESCRIPTION
When FundApps exploded from 20 to 50+ engineers in just one year, their old "everyone does support" model crumbled spectacularly. Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.

Flavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.

The twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!

The , filed this month,  claims Kleiner Perkins and Andreessen Horowitz, who’ve  of dollars into the gaming company, fostered a platform that monetizes children at the cost of their safety.Attorneys for Jaimee Seitz filed the lawsuit in the eastern district of Kentucky. Seitz is the mother of Audree Heine, a teen girl who committed suicide just after her 13th birthday in 2024. When detectives investigated Heine’s death they found she had a vast online social life that centered around groups in Discord and Roblox that idolized school shooters like Dylan Kleebold. Since Heine’s death, Seitz has been  about the unique dangers of Roblox.Heine’s family claims she would never have died had Roblox done a better job of moderating its platform. “Audree was pushed to suicide by an online community dedicated to glorifying violence and emulating notorious mass shooters, a community that can thrive and prey upon young children like Audree only because of Defendants’ egregiously tortious conduct,” the complaint said.Seitz’s lawyers filed the 89 page lawsuit on October 20 and in it attempted to make the case that Roblox’s problems all stem from cause: corporate greed. “The reason that Roblox is overrun with harmful content and predators is simple: Roblox prioritizes user growth, revenue, and eventual profits over child safety,” it said. “For years, Roblox has knowingly prioritized these numbers over the safety of children through the actions it has taken and decisions it has made to increase and monetize users regardless of the consequences.”According to the lawsuit, Roblox’s earning potential attracted big investors which encouraged it to abandon safety for quick cash. “Roblox’s business model allowed the company to attract significant venture capital funding from big-name investors like Kleiner Perkins and Andreessen Horowitz, putting enormous pressure on the company to prioritize growing and monetizing its users.”Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z is a venture capital firm whose previous investments include —a company that made money from noncensual AI porn—an “uncensored” AI project that offered users advice on , and startup that’s selling access to thousands of  for use in manipulating public opinion.In 2020, a16z  that raised $150 million for Roblox. “Roblox is one of those rare platform companies with massive traction and an organic, high-growth business model that will advance the company, and push the industry forward for many years to come,” David George, a general partner at the investment firm, said in a press release at the time. The lawsuit claims Roblox knows that kids are easy marks for low effort monetization efforts common in online video games. “Recognizing that children have more free time, underdeveloped cognitive functioning, and diminished impulse control, Roblox has exploited their vulnerability to lure them to its app,” it said.The lawsuit notes that Roblox did not require age verification for years, nor did it restrict communication between children and adults and didn’t require an adult to set up an account for a child. Roblox rolled out age verification and age-based communications systems in July, a feature that uses AI to scan the  to check their age.These kinds of basic safety features, however, have taken years to implement. According to the lawsuit, there’s a reason Roblox has been slow on safety. “In pursuit of growth, Roblox deprioritized safety measures even further so that it could report strong numbers to Wall Street,” it said. “For instance, Roblox executives rejected employee proposals for parental approval requirements that would protect children on the platform. Employees also reported feeling explicit pressure to avoid any changes that could reduce platform engagement, even when those changes would protect children from harmful interactions on the platform.”Roblox is now the subject of multiple investigative reports that have exposed the safety problems on its platforms. It’s also the subject of multiple lawsuits, Seitz’s is the 12th such case filed by Anapol Weiss, the law firm representing her.According to Seitz’s interviews with the press and the lawsuit, her daughter got caught up in a subculture on Roblox and Discord called The True Crime Community (TCC). “Through Roblox, Audree was exposed to emotional manipulation and social pressure by other users, including TCC members, who claimed to revere the Columbine shooters, depicted them as misunderstood outcasts who took revenge on their bullies, and encouraged violence against oneself and others,” the lawsuit said.404 Media searched through Roblox’s game servers after the lawsuit was filed and found multiple instances of games named for the Columbine massacre. One server used pictures from Parkland, Florida and another was advertised using the  of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris from the Columbine shooting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel SGX &quot;EUPDATESVN&quot; Support Ready For Linux 6.19 As A Feature Since Ice Lake</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-SGX-EUPDATESVN-Linux-6.19</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:24:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An improvement to Intel SGX slated for Linux 6.18 is supporting the EUPDATESVN found on Intel CPUs since the Ice Lake generation.

Discovery – and a number of rival bidders are likely to face stiff hurdles from US regulators in the blockbuster auction, On The Money has learned.That puts Paramount Skydance – the newly formed media giant headed by CEO David Ellison, the son of software magnate and longtime Trump backer Larry Ellison – clearly in the catbird seat as Warner Bros. Discovery kicks off a process to sell itself this week, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the matter.”Larry Ellison’s hire of Bari Weiss, a shameless right wing troll with no serious journalism experience, is part of a plan to turn CBS into a right wing propaganda platform that’s friendly to Trumpism and Netanyahu (the latter being particularly important to Ellison). Ownership of Warner Brothers would also give Ellison control of major outlets like CNN and media mainstays like HBO. If Ellison is able to also secure his talked about co-ownership of TikTok with Rupert Murdoch, there’s potential here to turn this amalgamation of outlets into something decidedly worse that Fox News/WSJ/New York Post as it pertains to right wing propaganda. Much like Fox News, the goal is clearly to build a new state media propaganda machine, financed by lower brow infotainment fare (see the Ellison’s $7.7 billion acquisition of MMA rights). Even if the acquisition happens, the kind of merger debt created by Ellisons’ acquisition spree almost always results in disastrous post-merger outcomes. It’s what cooked AT&T’s attempted domination of video advertising with its own acquisition of Time Warner, leading to no limit of industry chaos, layoffs, shittier product, and consumer price hikes. AT&T wound up running for the exits. There’s also no indication that this weird combination of nepobabies (David Ellison) and fail-upward brunchlords (Bari Weiss) will have any luck with their domination play. There are limited appetites for journalism that kisses right wing billionaire ass, given that’s a well-saturated market. They’re likely to not just struggle with the evolution in new media, but accelerate traditional media’s collapse.With any luck there will be some creative, hungrier opportunists, , waiting in the wings prepared to take full advantage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Initial Intel Crescent Island &quot;CRI&quot; Support Being Submitted For Linux 6.19</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Crescent-Island-Linux-619</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:57:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this month Intel announced Crescent Island as a Xe3P graphics card with 160GB of vRAM optimized for AI inferencing at the enterprise scale.

We should all know at this point that the “blame video games” crowd has not gotten any smaller recently and that video games are blamed for just about everything you can think of as a result. Presidential candidate gets shot at? Video games. Think that America is in a state of moral decay? Video games! Mass shootings? Video games, bruh! The abuse of Medicaid coverage? You guessed it: video games.This cultural default is so pervasive, in fact, then when the Baltimore Ravens started off this NFL season with one win in four contests, the team decided that part of the problem was the video game consoles in the locker room.On October 20, The Baltimore Sun reported that after going 1-3 and a player posting a photo of them playing games to social media, team officials and Harbaugh removed several “recreational staples” from the Ravens’ locker room. These included a basketball hoop, a ping pong table, a few corn hole boards, and some “video game consoles.”The report doesn’t specify which consoles, but it does mention that the team often played “intense rounds” of Super Smash Bros, so I’d assume some Switch or Switch 2 systems were removed. The outlet also says that these Super Smash sessions drew “small crowds of teammates late in the day.”I’ll just go ahead and note that the Ravens lost the following two games after those “recreational staples”, including the gaming consoles, were removed. Now, they won this past weekend, but that was because they were playing the Bears and the universe enjoys keeping me miserable, but that isn’t really the point.Instead, the point is that this reflex is stupid. Video games aren’t making the Ravens bad at football. A combination of the players playing and the coaches coaching is what is doing that. And while this is something of a silly story without any real important consequences coming from it, it certainly does highlight the silliness and ubiquity of this video game blaming reflex we seem to have as a society.Stop looking for scapegoats, in other words. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenRazer 3.11 Released With Linux Driver Support For Newer Razer Devices</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/OpenRazer-3.11-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:21:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenRazer 3.11 is out as the newest version of these out-of-tree but open-source and community-maintained drivers for Razer devices on Linux.

This time we decided to organize things a bit differently. We established four flagship , each of which covers a number of more specific goals. These themes cover the goals we expect to be the most impactful and constitute our major focus as a Project for the remainder of the year. The four themes identified in the RFC are as follows:, making it possible to create user-defined smart pointers that are as ergonomic as Rust's built-in references .Unblocking dormant traits, extending the core capabilities of Rust's trait system to unblock long-desired features for language interop, lending iteration, and more.Flexible, fast(er) compilation, making it faster to build Rust programs and improving support for specialized build scenarios like embedded usage and sanitizers., making higher-level usage patterns in Rust easier.One of Rust's core value propositions is that it's a "library-based language"—libraries can build abstractions that feel built-in to the language even when they're not. Smart pointer types like  and  are prime examples, implemented purely in the standard library yet feeling like native language features. However, Rust's built-in reference types ( and ) have special capabilities that user-defined smart pointers cannot replicate. This creates a "second-class citizen" problem where custom pointer types can't provide the same ergonomic experience as built-in references.The "Beyond the " initiative aims to share the special capabilities of , allowing library authors to create smart pointers that are truly indistinguishable from built-in references in terms of syntax and ergonomics. This will enable more ergonomic smart pointers for use in cross-language interop (e.g., references to objects in other languages like C++ or Python) and for low-level projects like Rust for Linux that use smart pointers to express particular data structures.
"Unblocking dormant traits"Rust's trait system is one of its most powerful features, but it has a number of longstanding limitations that are preventing us from adopting new patterns. The goals in this category unblock a number of new capabilities:Polonius will enable new borrowing patterns, and in particular unblock "lending iterators". Over the last few goal periods, we have identified an "alpha" version of Polonius that addresses the most important cases while being relatively simple and optimizable. Our goal for 2025H2 is to implement this algorithm in a form that is ready for stabilization in 2026.The next-generation trait solver is a refactored trait solver that unblocks better support for numerous language features (implied bounds, negative impls, the list goes on) in addition to closing a number of existing bugs and sources of unsoundness. Over the last few goal periods, the trait solver went from being an early prototype to being in production use for coherence checking. The goal for 2025H2 is to prepare it for stabilization.The work on evolving trait hierarchies will make it possible to refactor some parts of an existing trait into a new supertrait so they can be used on their own. This unblocks a number of features where the existing trait is insufficiently general, in particular stabilizing support for custom receiver types, a prior Project goal that wound up blocked on this refactoring. This will also make it safer to provide stable traits in the standard library while preserving the ability to evolve them in the future.The work to expand Rust's  hierarchy will permit us to express types that are neither  nor , such as extern types (which have no size) or Arm's Scalable Vector Extension (which have a size that is known at runtime but not at compilation time). This goal builds on RFC #3729 and RFC #3838, authored in previous Project goal periods.In-place initialization allows creating structs and values that are tied to a particular place in memory. While useful directly for projects doing advanced C interop, it also unblocks expanding  to support  and  methods, as compiling such methods requires the ability for the callee to return a future whose size is not known to the caller.The "Flexible, fast(er) compilation" initiative focuses on improving Rust's build system to better serve both specialized use cases and everyday development workflows:People generally start using Rust for foundational use cases, where the requirements for performance or reliability make it an obvious choice. But once they get used to it, they often find themselves turning to Rust even for higher-level use cases, like scripting, web services, or even GUI applications. Rust is often "surprisingly tolerable" for these high-level use cases -- except for some specific pain points that, while they impact everyone using Rust, hit these use cases particularly hard. We plan two flagship goals this period in this area:We aim to stabilize cargo script, a feature that allows single-file Rust programs that embed their dependencies, making it much easier to write small utilities, share code examples, and create reproducible bug reports without the overhead of full Cargo projects.We aim to finalize the design of ergonomic ref-counting and to finalize the experimental impl feature so it is ready for beta testing. Ergonomic ref-counting makes it less cumbersome to work with ref-counted types like  and , particularly in closures.For the remainder of 2025 you can expect monthly blog posts covering the major progress on the Project goals.Looking at the broader picture, we have now done three iterations of the goals program, and we want to judge how it should be run going forward. To start, Nandini Sharma from CMU has been conducting interviews with various Project members to help us see what's working with the goals program and what could be improved. We expect to spend some time discussing what we should do and to be launching the next iteration of the goals program next year. Whatever form that winds up taking, Tomas Sedovic, the Rust program manager hired by the Leadership Council, will join me in running the program.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are Web Browsers With Integrated Chatbots A Paradigm Shift – Or Just Privacy And Security Disasters Waiting To Happen?</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/27/are-web-browsers-with-integrated-chatbots-a-paradigm-shift-or-just-privacy-and-security-disasters-waiting-to-happen/</link><author>Glyn Moody</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 22:20:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We think that AI represents a rare once a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about and how to use one, and how to most productively and pleasantly use the Web.AI is a disruptive force that could allow new sectoral leaders to emerge in the digital world, and the browser is clearly a key market. Chatbots are already popular as an alternative way to search for and access information, so it makes sense to embrace that by fully integrating them into the browser.  Moreover, as OpenAI writes in its post about Atlas: “your browser is where all of your work, tools, and context come together. A browser built with ChatGPT takes us closer to a true super-assistant that understands your world and helps you achieve your goals.”  The intent to supplant Google’s browser at the heart of the digital world is clear.Given its leading role in AI, OpenAI’s offering is of particular interest as a guide to how this new kind of browser might work and be used. There are two main elements to Atlas. One is “browser memories”:If you turn on browser memories, ChatGPT will remember key details from content you browse to improve chat responses and offer smarter suggestions—like creating a to-do list from your recent activity or continuing to research holiday gifts based on products you’ve viewed.Browser memories are private to your ChatGPT account and under your control. You can view them all in settings, archive ones that are no longer relevant, and clear your browsing history to delete them. Even when browser memories are on, you can decide which sites ChatGPT can or can’t see using the toggle in the address bar. When visibility is off, ChatGPT can’t view the page content, and no memories are created from it.Browser memories are potentially a privacy nightmare, since they can hold all kinds of sensitive information about users — and their browsing habits. OpenAI is clearly aware of this, hence the numerous options to control exactly what is remembered. The problem is that many users can’t be bothered making privacy-preserving tweaks to how they browse. Browser memories could certainly make online activities easier and more efficient, which is likely to encourage people to turn them on without much thought for possible consequences later on. The same is true of the other important optional feature of Atlas: agent mode.In agent mode, ChatGPT can complete end to end tasks for you like researching a meal plan, making a list of ingredients, and adding the groceries to a shopping cart ready for delivery. You’re always in control: ChatGPT is trained to ask before taking many important actions, and you can pause, interrupt, or take over the browser at any time.Once again, OpenAI is aware of the risks such a powerful agent mode brings with it, and has tried to minimize these in the following ways:It cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensionsIt cannot access other apps on your computer or file systemIt will pause to ensure you’re watching it take actions on specific sensitive sites such as financial institutionsYou can use agent in logged out mode to limit its access to sensitive data and the risk of it taking actions as you on websitesBesides simply making mistakes when acting on your behalf, agents are susceptible to hidden malicious instructions, which may be hidden in places such as a webpage or email with the intention that the instructions override ChatGPT agent’s intended behavior. This could lead to stealing data from sites you’re logged into or taking actions you didn’t intend.The security and privacy risks involved here still feel insurmountably high to me – I certainly won’t be trusting any of these products until a bunch of security researchers have given them a very thorough beating.Web browsers with chatbots built in are an interesting development, and may represent a paradigm shift for working online. Done properly, their utility could range from handy to life changing. But the danger is that FOMO and pressure from investors will cause companies to rush the release of products in this sector, before they are really safe for ordinary users to deploy with real, deeply-private information, and with agent access to critically-important online accounts — and real money.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Emmanuel Acho Left the NFL to Create a New Kind of Platform | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gndot6PX_U</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-Gndot6PX_U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly talk to the former football player and award-winning producer Emmanuel Acho about why he rejected the NFL and rebranded as a media influencer.

He said that last time. He’s president again, so apparently it’s time to see if this adage holds up. Trump has already pretended the mere existence of foreign gang members anywhere in the world justifies whatever actions he chooses to take under the heading of “immigration enforcement.” That includes sending people to countries they’ve never lived in or back to countries they fled from for fear of getting tortured or killed. All of this has been greeted with shrug from a man with an ill-fitting jacket and head full of hate. In recent weeks, things have escalated. Trump is pretending the mere existence of a worldwide drug trade is a combination of undeclared war on the United States and an ongoing act of terrorism. So, we’ve just started committing extrajudicial killings in international waters and expecting DOJ/DoD lawyers to work out the legal details after the fact. A few legislators have started to speak up about this, suggesting that, at the very least, Trump should approach Congress to secure a declaration of war to justify these… well, let’s call them what they are: murders. Even though he’s got a majority working for him, Trump doesn’t want to do this. He’d rather just do whatever he wants and let everyone else deal with the consequences. Trump has never been the most coherent or erudite of orators. And that’s what gives statements like these an extra edge: the boorish, almost-bored vow to commit murder spilling out of the mouth of the nation’s largest single-cell organism.Trump: "I don't think we're necessarily going to ask for a declaration of war, I think we're just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. We're going to kill them. They're going to be, like dead."Here’s what Trump said, in case you can’t see the embed:Trump: “I don’t think we’re necessarily going to ask for a declaration of war, I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. We’re going to kill them. They’re going to be, like dead.”That is chilling. There’s literally no precedent for that in this country. And he’s not just talking about the nearly daily sinking of boats Trump and Hegseth claim (without evidence) are filled with drugs and drug dealers. He’s talking about what’s in the works, which appears to be a land invasion of Venezuela and Colombia.That’s the sort of thing that usually requires a declaration of war. But, of course, Republican presidents in particular have tended to feel congressional involvement isn’t necessarily needed. George Bush invaded Panama to take down Manuel Noriega. Ronald Reagan did the same thing in Grenada. And the less said about the forever war on terror, the better, because I’d hate to see what’s being discussed now turn into decades of misery for everyone involved.This is horrific and it should have been immediately greeted by a deafening uproar by Democratic leaders. It should have been rejected out of hand by members of Trump’s own party. Instead, it has just become another part of the background noise that is the Trump administration grinding its way towards its authoritarian goals. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Medieval Expert SHOCKED By Accuracy of King Arthur: Legend of The Sword</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH561Rfr56Y</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qH561Rfr56Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 20:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How does Guy Ritchie's film, starring Jude Law, compare to King Arthur's real legend? 

Medieval historian Dr Hetta Howes (author of Poet, Mystic, Widow, Wife) reacts to Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, separating Hollywood fantasy from medieval sources. We explore the facts behind the fiction, from the opening battle's elephants to that David Beckham cameo.

We dive into the film's biggest changes: Arthur's brothel upbringing, the conflation of Excalibur with the Sword in the Stone, and the "weird snake sirens" that replace the Lady of the Lake. Dr Hetta Howes explains the real medieval stories of Uther Pendragon, Vortigern, Igraine, and the true origins of the Round Table.

The decision window is short, just 15 minutes. In the film that’s all the time the President has to assess the threat, pick targets, and decide if the US should also launch its nuclear weapons. It’s about how much time they’d have in real life too.In , America’s early warning systems detect the launch of a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The final target is Chicago and when it lands more than 20 million people will die in a flash. Facing the destruction of a major American city, the President must decide what—if any—action to take in response. The US has hundreds of nuclear missiles ready to go and plans to strike targets across Russia, China, and North Korea. But there’s a catch. In the film, America didn’t see who fired the nuke and no one is taking credit. It’s impossible to know who to strike and in what proportion. What’s a president to do?  tells the story of this 15 minute Zoom call—from detection of the launch to its terminal arrival in Chicago—three different times. There’s dozens of folks on the call, from deputy advisors to the Secretary of Defense to the President himself, and each run through of the events gives the audience a bigger peak at how the whole machine operates, culminating, in the end, with the President’s view.Many of the most effective and frightening films about nukes— and —focus on the lives of the humans living in the blast zone. They’re about the crumbling of society in a wasteland, beholden to the decisions of absent political powers so distant that they often never appear on screen.  is about those powerful people caught in the absurd game of nuclear war, forced to make decisions with limited information and enormous consequences.In both the movie and real life, America has ground-based interceptors stationed in California and Alaska that are meant to knock a nuke out of the sky should one ever get close. The early film follows missileers in Alaska as they launch the interceptor only to have it fail. It’s a horrifying and very real possibility. The truth of interceptors is that we don’t have many of them, the window to hit a fast moving ICBM is narrow, and in tests they only work about half the time.“So it’s a fucking coin toss? That’s what $50 billion buys us?” Secretary of Defense Reid Baker, played by Jarred Harris, says in the film. This detail caught the eye of the Trump White House, which plans to spend around  on a space based version of the same tech. Bloomberg reported on an internal Pentagon memo that  to debunk ’s claims about missile defense. The Missile Defense Agency  that interceptors “have displayed a 100% accuracy rate in testing for more than a decade.” The Pentagon separately told Bloomberg that it wasn’t consulted on the film at all.Director Bigelow worked closely with the CIA to make , but has tussled with the Pentagon before. The DoD didn’t like  and pulled out of the project after showing some initial support. Bigelow has said in interviews that she wanted  to be an independent project.Despite that independence,  nails the details of nuclear war in 2025. The acronyms, equipment, and procedures are all frighteningly close to reality and Bigelow did have help on set from retired US Army lieutenant general and former US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) Chief of Staff Dan Karbler.Karbler is a career missile guy and as the chief of staff of STRATCOM he oversaw America’s nuclear weapons. He told 404 Media that he landed the gig by scaring the hell out of Bigelow and her staff on, appropriately, a Zoom call.Bigelow wanted to meet Karbler and they set up a big conference call on Zoom. He joined the call but kept his camera off. As people filtered in, Karbler listened and waited. “Here’s how it kind of went down,” Karbler told 404 Media. “There’s a little break in the conversation so I click on my microphone, still leaving the camera off, and I just said: ‘This is the DDO [deputy director of operations] convening a National Event Conference. Classification of this conference TOP SECRET. TK [Talent Keyhole] SI: US STRATCOM, US INDOPACOM, US Northern Command, SecDef Cables, military system to the secretary.”“SecDef Cables, please bring the secretary of defense in the conference. Mr. Secretary, this is the DDO. Because of the time constraints of this missile attack, recommend we transition immediately from a national event conference to a nuclear decision conference, and we bring the President into the conference. PEOC [Presidential Emergency Operations Center], please bring the President into the conference.”“And I stopped there and I clicked on my camera and I said, ‘ladies and gentleman, that’s how the worst day in American history will begin. I hope your script does it some justice,’” Karbler said. The theatrics worked and, according to Karbler, he sat next to Bigelow every day on set and helped shape the movie. begins and ends with ambiguity. We never learn who fired the nuclear weapon at Chicago. The last few minutes of the film focus on the President looking through retaliation plans. He’s in a helicopter, moments from the nuke hitting Chicago, and looking through plans that would condemn millions of people on the planet to fast and slow deaths. The film ends as he wallows in this decision, we never learn what he chooses.Karbler said it was intentional. “The ending was ambiguous so the audience would leave with questions,” he said. “The easy out would have been: ‘Well, let’s just have a nuclear detonation over Chicago.’ That’s the easy out. Leaving it like it is, you risk pissing off the audience, frankly, because they want a resolution of some sort, but they don’t get that resolution. So instead they’re going to have to be able to have a discussion.”In my house, at least, the gambit worked. During the credits my wife and I talked about whether or not we’d launch the nukes ourselves (We’d both hold off) and I explained the unpleasant realities of ground based interceptors. Karbler, too, said he wouldn’t have launched the nukes. It’s just one nuke, after all. It’s millions of people, sure, but if America launches its nukes in retaliation then there’s a good chance Russia, China, and everyone else might do the same. “Because of the potential of a response provoking a much, much broader response, and something that would not be proportional,” Karbler said. “Don’t get me wrong, 20 million people, an entire city, a nuclear attack that hit us, but if we respond back, then you’re going to get into im-proportionality calculus.”Despite the horrors present on screen in , Karbler isn’t a nuclear abolitionist. “The genie is out of the bottle, you’re not going to put it back in there,” he said. “So what do we do to ensure our best defense? It seems counterintuitive, you know, the best defense is gonna be a good offense. You’ve gotta be able to have a response back against the adversary.”Basically, Karbler says we should do what we’re doing now: build a bunch more nukes and make sure your enemies know you’re willing to use them. “Classic deterrence has three parts: impose unacceptable costs on the adversary. Deny the adversary any benefit of attack, read that as our ability to defend ourselves, missile defense, but also have the credible messaging behind it,” he said.These are weapons that have the power to end the world, weapons we make and pray we never use. But we do keep making them. Almost all the old nuclear treaties between Russia and America are gone. The US is spending trillions to replace old ICBM silos and make new nuclear weapons. After decades of maintaining a relatively small nuclear force, China is building up its own stockpiles. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🔴 LIVE: Discovering Ancient Egyptian Secrets | Lost Treasures of Egypt Full Episodes | Nat Geo</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqQJmDiW0xs</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FqQJmDiW0xs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 18:27:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Secrets of Tutankhamun

Brock correctly calls this out as , not neutrality—a calculation about whose value to the firm matters more.The thing that struck me about Brock’s piece is that it highlights how there’s a broader pattern here: institutional cowardice from organizations that spout high-minded ideals as a shield to explain their refusal to make a clear decision, while ignoring that doing so is a very real choice with very real consequences.That’s worth highlighting, because we keep seeing it play out in nearly identical ways. Whether it’s a venture capital firm or a social media platform, the playbook is the same: invoke “neutrality” or “free speech” as a shield, refuse to take a clear stance on bigoted behavior, and then act shocked when the people being targeted decide they don’t want to stick around.This is the Nazi bar problem, and it keeps happening because people in positions of power either don’t understand it or don’t want to.If you’re not familiar with the Nazi bar analogy, it comes from a story about a bartender who learned the hard way that if you don’t kick out the first Nazi who walks in, you end up running a Nazi bar. Not because you’re a Nazi yourself, but because once word gets out that Nazis are welcome, they keep coming back and bringing friends. And everyone else? They stop showing up. Because who wants to drink at the Nazi bar?The key insight—the one that keeps getting missed—is that claiming “neutrality” in these situations isn’t actually neutral. . You’re choosing to prioritize the speech and presence of the people spewing bigotry over the speech and presence of the people being targeted by it. And that second part is what everyone claiming to be “neutral” conveniently ignores.We saw this exact dynamic play out with Substack last year. CEO Chris Best went on Nilay Patel’s podcast and  to answer straightforward questions about whether Substack would host overtly racist content. Nilay asked him point-blank: if someone says “we should not allow brown people in the country,” is that allowed on Substack?Best wouldn’t answer. He kept deflecting to vague principles about “freedom of speech” and “freedom of the press” and how Substack wasn’t going to “engage in content moderation gotchas.”But here’s the thing: not answering  an answer. When you refuse to say “no, we won’t host that,” you’re saying “yes, we will.” . Bigots hear it. The targets of bigots hear it. Everyone hears it. As much as you pretend it’s “staying out of it,” it is  statement. The bigots hear it as “you’re welcome here.” The people being targeted hear it as “your safety and dignity matter less than our commitment to not making hard calls.”If you’re not going to moderate, and you don’t care that the biggest draws on your platform are pure nonsense peddlers preying on the most gullible people to get their subscriptions, fucking own it, Chris.Say it. Say that you’re the Nazi bar and you’re proud of it.Say “we believe that writers on our platform can publish anything they want, no matter how ridiculous, or hateful, or wrong.” Don’t hide from the question. You claim you’re enabling free speech, so own it. Don’t hide behind some lofty goals about “freedom of the press” when you’re really enabling “freedom of the grifters.”And, of course, it wasn’t much surprise earlier this year when Substack took that “statement” to the next level and literally started recommending and promoting blatant pro-Nazi speech. You made your choice. You voted for Nazis and against anyone who doesn’t like Nazis.Don’t pretend it’s about “neutrality” or “free speech.” It’s not. You made a choice. You made a decision. Nazis are welcome. Those targeted by them… are not.The exact same cowardice is on display at Sequoia, just in a different context. As Brock notes, managing partner Roelof Botha has described the firm’s approach as “institutional neutrality where staff are entitled to their own positions.”And here’s what that “neutrality” actually accomplished: Sumaiya Balbale, a practicing Muslim who has spoken publicly about how her gender, ethnicity, and faith shaped her career, felt she had no choice but to leave.Meanwhile, Shaun Maguire—who wrote that Zohran Mamdani “comes from a culture that lies about everything” and that “it’s literally a virtue to lie if it advances his Islamist agenda,” who endorsed far-right extremists around the globe—gets to stay because he picked a good rocket company.This is  Sequoia made. Not “we’re neutral.” Not “everyone gets to speak.” The choice was: we value the partner who makes Islamophobic statements more than we value the COO who objects to them.Sequoia took the cowardly way out. It made a choice, but it wouldn’t own it, just like Substack refuses to own its pro-Nazi position. It pretends it doesn’t by saying “we’re staying neutral.” But their version of “staying neutral” and “supporting free speech” is really “bigotry and hatred are welcome” and then, what follows naturally is “the targets of bigotry and hatred must leave.”And it’s the exact same choice Substack made. When Best refused to answer Nilay’s questions, he was saying: we value the revenue from writers who publish bigoted content more than we value the writers and readers who don’t want to be associated with that content.Both organizations are hiding behind “free speech” and “neutrality” to avoid owning what they’re actually doing, which is creating an environment where one kind of speech—bigoted, hateful speech—is implicitly encouraged, while another kind of speech—the speech of people who say “I don’t want to work here” or “I don’t want to publish here” or “I don’t want to be associated with this”—is implicitly discouraged.Because here’s what gets lost in all the hand-wringing about free speech: free speech isn’t just about whether you’re  to say something. It’s also about whether you feel  saying it. Whether you feel welcome. Whether the environment is one where your voice matters as much as anyone else’s.When Sequoia chose not to discipline Maguire, they sent a clear message to Balbale and everyone like her: your concerns don’t matter as much as his returns. When Substack refuses to draw clear lines about what’s acceptable, they send a message to every writer and reader who’s being targeted by bigotry: you’re on your own here.And those people hear the message loud and clear. They leave. Or they never show up in the first place.This is what Brock means when he writes:Sumaiya Balbale walking out the door while Shaun Maguire keeps his partnership isn’t a scandal Sequoia is managing. It’s a decision Sequoia made—about whose presence matters, whose complaints count, and which political positions are compatible with partnership.It’s also what we meant when we wrote about Substack:You have every right to allow that on your platform. But the whole point of everyone eventually coming to terms with the content moderation learning curve, and the fact that private businesses are private and not the government, is that what you allow on your platform is what sticks to you. It’s your reputation at play.Both Sequoia and Substack want to pretend they’re taking the principled high road by refusing to “censor” anyone. But what they’re actually doing is making a choice about whose speech and whose presence they value more. And in both cases, they’re choosing the bigots over the people being targeted by bigotry.That’s not neutrality. That’s not a commitment to free speech. That’s just being “the Nazi bar” and refusing to admit it.The frustrating part is that there are real, difficult tradeoffs in content moderation and community standards. We’ve written about this . There’s no perfect answer. Every decision you make will piss off someone. Drawing lines is hard, and where you draw them will differ based on your values, your community, and your goals.Refusing to draw any lines at all—or claiming you’re “neutral” when you’re actually just choosing to tolerate bigotry—. And the people you’re abdicating your responsibility to protect will notice, and they’ll leave, and you’ll end up with exactly the reputation you deserve.Sequoia can call it “institutional neutrality” all they want. Substack can invoke “freedom of the press.” But when your COO walks out because you won’t address Islamophobia, or when your users leave because you won’t say whether racism is not allowed, you’ve made your choice clear.You’re the Nazi bar now. Own it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Meals You Love – AI-powered meal planning and grocery shopping</title><link>https://mealsyoulove.com/</link><author>tylertreat</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:57:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: Babbel Language Learning (All Languages)</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/27/daily-deal-babbel-language-learning-all-languages-22/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:57:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Become a language expert with a Babbel Language Learning subscription.

(That it tends to dovetail nicely with white Christian nationalism is just a bonus in these Trumpian times.) But somehow they never seem to be able to spend a dime of their own when people are in need.Just take a look at Kristi Noem, current DHS head and former South Dakota governor. Noem sent a bunch of South Dakota National Guard members to the Texas border. Later, she refused to spend money deploying troops while her constituents were getting flooded out of their homes. She justified her refusal to spend residents’ tax dollars to help residents by pointing out the trip to the Texas border was actually paid for by someone with more money than discretion. She apparently hoped this would offset the $1.3 million in state emergency relief funds she blew on being performative, rather than on helping out the people who likely voted for her. It’s always nice to have a few helpful millionaires/billionaires in your pocket. Donald Trump has more than a few of those. With the GOP refusing to negotiate in good faith with the Democratic party on a funding bill, the government remains shut down. Despite the fact that it’s the GOP holding the country hostage, rich Trump supporters who would absolutely riot if anyone suggested raising  taxes are cutting massive checks to cover a few of the administration’s expenses during this shut down. Mr. Trump announced the donation on Thursday night, but he declined to name the person who provided the funds, only calling him a “patriot” and a friend. “He doesn’t want publicity,” Mr. Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. “He prefer that his name not be mentioned which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.”The New York Times managed to identify the person behind this generous donation — a donation that can only be considered “generous” in the sense that it never should have happened in the first place. Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the U.S. government to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.It sounds like a lot, but we’re talking about a government that has been several trillion in the hole for years now. I’d love to see how this gets divvied up because if it’s just divided equally, it’s not going to mean a thing to the troops currently getting screwed by the party that claims it loves them the most. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Trump administration’s 2025 budget requested about $600 billion in total military compensation. A $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member.Getting an extra Benjamin is nice if you’re already getting paid. When you’re not getting paid, $100 is just enough money to make you resent it. Sure, you’ve got $100 more than you had before Mellon stepped briefly out of the shadows to stuff a little cash into Trump’s coat pocket, but what the fuck are you supposed to do with it? It’s not enough to do anything practical, like keep all the utilities on or cover the house payment or even stock the cupboards. May as well just toss it in the nearest slot machine and hope for the best.Mellon is a billionaire and a fan of Trump, as so many billionaires are. He’s also donated millions to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his anti-vax efforts. He’s also this guy:In an autobiography that he self-published in 2015, Mr. Mellon described himself as a former liberal who moved to Wyoming from Connecticut for lower taxes and to be surrounded by fewer people.His book also contains several incendiary passages about race. He wrote that Black people were “even more belligerent” after social programs were expanded in the 1960s and ’70s, and that social safety net programs amounted to “slavery redux.”And yet here he is, being a social safety net for thousands of troops who may never even see the money he gave to the Trump administration. For one thing, the logistics costs alone would probably eat up a great deal of what’s been donated. For another, this is pretty clearly illegal, which means no distribution will even happen.[T]he donation appears to be a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending money in excess of congressional appropriations or from accepting voluntary services.With that much still unsettled, this may remain in limbo. And that’s probably for the best. The only thing more insulting that gifting troops with a useless $100 bill would be clawing it back once federal funding resumes. Finally, if we really want billionaires to bail out the government, the easiest way to do this is by TAXING THEM MORE. Let’s not pretend this guy is some sort of quiet hero who did this because he cares too deeply for this country to see soldiers go without pay. He did this because it’s another way to ensure he and the rest of the people in his tax bracket remain as privileged as they’ve always been. $100 can be gone in a second. But influence and access is forever.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ubuntu Unity In Need Of More Developers To Survive</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-Unity-25.10-Troubles</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 16:27:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ubuntu Unity community flavor of Ubuntu Linux built around the Unity desktop is in a difficult position and at risk for its survival given the lack of developers involved.

If the object’s geometry and shape remain the same as it gets bigger, then its surface area will increase roughly as fast as its volume to the two-thirds power.

Magnus Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and World Champion Gukesh played three days of fast rapid chess (10m+5spm), a double round robin each day, eventually adding up to 18 rounds, Clutch chess is a special scoring system where the points available from each game increased each day from 1 to 2 to 3 with similar increases for draws from 0.5 to 1 to 1.5. Magnus Carlsen was the runaway winner, the large margin was due to his domination of Gukesh who made huge errors in their games and only managed one draw, there has to be a psychological component to these mistakes as his score was perfectly decent against the other players. Carlsen won all the mini-matches and continues to be better than anyone else. Fabiano Caruana finished second, Nakamura third and Gukesh last. The scoring system didn't change the finishing order of the players in any way.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does this make Billy an honorary grandparent? 🥹 #BillyAndMolly</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A3xNgSo1mxI</link><author>Nat Geo Animals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/A3xNgSo1mxI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 14:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPk9MG2RexnOMGTD-YnSnA">Nat Geo Animals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#BillyAndMolly: An Otter Love Story is now streaming on @disneyplus and @hulu.

Yes, technically, according to testing conducted by 404 Media. Zenni’s ID Guard glasses block infrared light. It’s impossible to open an iPhone with FaceID while wearing them and they black out the eyes of the wearer in photos taken with infrared cameras.However, ID Guard glasses will not at all stop some of the most common forms of facial recognition that are easy to access and abuse.

And if as on cue, the company announced they’d be once again hiking prices on their HBO () streaming video service:“HBO Max’s ad plan is going from $10 per month to $11/month. The ad-free plan is going from $17/month to $18.49/month. And the premium ad-free plan (which adds 4K support, Dolby Atmos, and the ability to download more content) is increasing from $21 to $23.Meanwhile, prices for HBO Max’s annual plans are increasing from $100 to $110 with ads, $170 to $185 without ads, and $210 to $230 for the premium tier.”Again: these are executives all out of original ideas, boxed in by Wall Street’s demand for impossible, endless growth. They can’t deliver consumers and labor what  want (better pay, better product, lower prices, better customer service), so execs have to resort to financial trickery, price hikes, and megamergers to goose stock valuations and provide significant tax relief.They’re not building or improving anything, they’re just engaged in an elaborate shell game where they shuffle things around and pretend they’re savvy deal makers. If you’re not familiar with what happens next: Warner Brothers is sold (probably to Larry Ellison and Paramount/CBS, which is already laying off people from its latest merger). The massive debt load triggers even more layoffs and additional price hikes, the quality of the overall product continues to deteriorate, and annoyed customers flee to fee alternatives, including piracy.At that point the executives responsible blame everything but themselves (generational entitlement! VPNs!) until companies are finally forced to face evolutionary disruption by more convenient, cheaper alternatives, at which point the execs responsible have taken their bag and failed upward to other companies. And the cycle repeats itself all over again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The sea creatures in Madagascar are amazing — but can they survive? #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vteuwTShvyo</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vteuwTShvyo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:01:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Overfishing in southwest Madagascar is causing the region’s incredible coral reefs — and the human life they sustain — to collapse.

But look to the data, and that story starts to fall apart. Emissions are peaking in key sectors. Clean energy is scaling faster than anyone predicted. Real progress is happening. It’s just not happening in the way we imagine it.

Sean’s guest today is Hannah Ritchie, Deputy Editor at Our World in Data and author of Clearing the Air: A Hopeful Guide to Solving Climate Change. They discuss why our picture of the planet is so distorted, why despair can be as dangerous as denial, and what a truly energy-abundant, livable future could look like.

    Suba didn’t begin playing chess until the unusually late age of 19, yet within just a few years he had risen to become a formidable competitor. He was crowned Romanian Champion three times - in 1980, 1981, and 1985 -
    and narrowly missed qualifying for the Candidates Tournament after finishing third at the 1982 Las Palmas Interzonal.
  
    Among his tournament triumphs were first place at Dortmund 1983, and shared first at Prague 1985 and Timisoara 1987. 
    In 1988, during the Lloyds Bank Masters in London, Suba defected from Romania to England, though he would soon represent his home country again after the fall of the communist regime. 
    In 2017, he transferred his federation to Spain, having spent much of his life there.
  
    His book , first published by Pergamon Chess in 1991, offered a distinctive and personal perspective on chess through his own games. It has since become a classic, with a new edition released by New In Chess in 2016.

However, goal was to combine privacy of Vanadium with the power of desktop extensions and Helium features, and make it accessible to a wider audience. (Passkeys from Bitwarden Mobile should also work straight away once merged in the list of FIDO2 privileged browsers)Build scripts are in the repo if you want to compile it yourself.

This is more than a history lesson; it's a deep dive into power, contradiction, and the price of freedom. Louverture was an illiterate former slave who became a brilliant military general and Governor-General-for-Life but the story doesn't end there. Discover the dark controversy surrounding his later years—the secret of the slaves he owned, the brutal military discipline he enforced, and the political maneuvers that ultimately led to his downfall by Napoleon Bonaparte.

If you've heard the name, but don't know the full, shocking truth, you need to see this. Was he a hero, a tyrant, or a necessary evil? Watch now and decide for yourself.

Last year, I got rejected after a job interview because I lacked some CPU knowledge. After that, I decided to deepen my understanding in the low level world and learn how things work under the hood. I decided to try and create an OS in C and ASM as a way to broaden my knowledge in this area.This took me on the most interesting ride, where I’ve learned about OS theory and low level programming on a whole new level.  I’ve spent hours upon hours, blood and tears, reading different OS theory blogs, learning low level concepts, debugging, testing and working on this project.This part was the longest, but also the easiest. I felt like I understood the theory, but still could not connect it into actual code. Sitting down and starting to code was difficult, but I knew that was the next step I needed to  take! 
I began by working on the bootloader, which is optional since you can use a pre-made one (I switched to GRUB later), but implementing it was mainly for learning purposes and to warm up on ASM. These were my steps after that:  1) I started implementing the VGA driver, which gave me the ability to display text.
  2) Interrupts - IDT, ISR, IRQ, which signal to the CPU that a certain event occurred and needs handling (such as faults, hardware connected device actions, etc).
  3) Keyboard driver, which enables me to display the same text I type on my keyboard.
  4) PMM (Physical memory management)
  5) Paging and virtual memory management
  6) RTC driver - clock addition (which was, in my opinion, optional)
  7) PIT driver - Ticks every certain amount of time, and also  
  8) FS (File System) and physical HDD drivers - for the HDD I chose PATA (HDD communication protocol) for simplicity (SATA is a newer but harder option as well).
     For the FS I chose EXT2 (The Second Extended FileSystem), which is a foundational linux FS structure introduced in 1993. This FS structure is not the simplest,
     but is very popular in hobby-OS, it is very supported, easy to set up and upgrade to newer EXT versions, it has a lot of materials online, compared to other
     options. This was probably the longest and largest feature I had worked on.
  9) Syscall support.
  10) Libc implementation.
  11) Processing and scheduling for multiprocessing.
  12) Here I also made a shell to test it all.

At this point, I had a working shell, but later decided to go further and add a GUI! I was working on the FS (stage 8), when I heard about Hack Club’s Summer of Making (SoM). This was my first time practicing in HackClub, and I want to express my gratitude and share my enjoyment of participating in it.At first I just wanted to declare the OS as finished after completing the FS, and a bit of other drivers, but because of SoM my perspective was changed completely. Because of the competition, I started to think that I needed to ship a complete OS, with processing, GUI and the bare minimum ability to run Doom. I wanted to show the community in SoM how everything works.Then I worked on it for another 2 months, after finishing the shell, just because of SoM!,  totalling my project to almost 7 months of work. At this time I added full GUI support, with dirty rectangles and double buffering, I made a GUI mouse driver, and even made a full Doom port! things I would've never even thought about without participating in SoM.Every project has challenges, especially in such a low level project. I had to do a lot of debugging while working on this, and it is no easy task. I highly recommend using GDB which helped me debug so many of my problems, especially memory ones.The first major challenge I encountered was during the coding of processes - I realized that a lot of my paging code was completely wrong, poorly tested, and had to be reworked. During this time I was already in the competition and it was difficult keeping up with devlogs and new features while fixing old problems in a code I wrote a few months ago.Some more major problems occurred when trying to run Doom, and unlike the last problem, this was a disaster. I had random PFs and memory problems, one run could work while the next one wouldn’t, and the worst part is that it was only on the Doom, and not on processes I created myself. These issues took a lot of time to figure out. I began to question the Doom code itself, and even thought about giving up on the whole project.After a lot of time spent debugging, I fixed the issues. It was a combination of scheduling issues, Libc issues and the Qemu not having enough (wrongfully assuming 128MB for the whole OS was enough).Finally, I worked throughout all the difficulties, and shipped the project! In the end, the experience working on this project was amazing. I learned a lot, grew and improved as a developer, and I thank SoM for helping to increase my motivation and make the project memorable and unique like I never imagined it would be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Funniest/Most Insightful Comments Of The Week At Techdirt</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/26/funniest-most-insightful-comments-of-the-week-at-techdirt-182/</link><author>Leigh Beadon</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So the tech bros who funded Trump are finding out why our societies spent several hundred years expanding the concepts of the rule of law and (the idea of at least) justice for all to include the man at the topIt’s already started with the media ownersI’ve got no sympathy for them.

Jacques-Louis David was the image-maker of revolutions, regimes, and empire. Born into a France simmering with discontent in the build up to Revolution, his life was marked by violence, ambition, and turbulence. 
He voted to execute a king, helped build the myth of a revolutionary republic, and when that republic imploded, he helped crown an emperor. Drawn repeatedly to authoritarian figures - from Robespierre and Marat to Napoleon Bonaparte - David couldn’t resist the magnetic pull of power.
His 1801 masterpiece Napoleon Crossing the Alps reveals everything about David: his obsession with power, his taste for dramatic storytelling, and how seeing is believing.
This is the story of art as propaganda.

She can no longer breathe freely. A donor organ is finally found. The film shows the beginning of her new life. Her struggle, her happiness, and her setbacks.

Ruth Bopp will never forget October 20, 2023. At 3:50 a.m., the ringing of her cell phone roused her from sleep. On the other end of the line: Hannover Medical School. The news: there was a suitable lung for her. An ambulance was already on its way.
Ruth Bopp suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, a serious chronic disease that makes breathing increasingly difficult. For years, she was dependent on an oxygen tank. After the transplant, she was able to breathe freely again just four days later - without a tube or device. "It was an indescribable feeling,” she says. "Finally being able to breathe on my own again - that was wonderful.”
But Ruth's story is an exception. In Germany, 8,400 patients are urgently waiting for a donor organ - but there are only 965 donors. The country has what’s known as an "opt-in” policy: organ or tissue donation is only possible if the deceased person has given their consent during their lifetime - or if their relatives do so retroactively. In many other European countries such as France, Spain and the Netherlands, however, an "opt-out” policy applies: anyone who does not expressly object is automatically considered a donor.
The documentary provides an insight into what life with a serious lung disease is like, and traces the path to transplantation. The film also documents the emotional power of hope. Ruth Bopp makes an urgent appeal to society: "If you need an organ yourself, you want it straight away - but very few people consider the idea of donating themselves.” Yet current surveys show a positive trend: according to a study by one medical insurance group, 49% of adults in Germany now have an organ donor card - compared to 41% in 2021.

Idealism is the theory that all reality is consciousness and only consciousness, and that what we perceive to be the physical world is either a manifestation of consciousness or derived from it. Either way, fundamental reality is pure consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Idealism (like the common sense of the physical)?

Meanwhile her closest rival Anna Sargsyan was the beneficiary
of a very serious blunder 34.Re1? (34.Rd3!=) by Alice Lee which was almost immediately
decisive, she took second place alone after Irina Krush could only draw
against her long term rival Anna Zatonskih.

Mystic, healer, sinner, saint—Grigori Rasputin has been called many things. But who was the Mad Monk of Russia, really? From his rise in the royal court to his mysterious influence over the Romanovs, this episode explores how one man became a symbol of everything wrong in a crumbling empire—and how myth and reality collided in the final days of Tsarist Russia.

One that is deployed against men, as well as women. The enemy is not killed, but destroyed nonetheless. In this documentary, men from Ukraine, Congo and Bosnia break their silence.

Most male survivors of sexual violence remain silent. So the perpetrators get away with it. Often, the perpetrators do not even have a sense of wrongdoing when they commit these war crimes.

The first men to seek justice at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague were survivors of the Bosnian War (1992-1995). This marked a turning point.

Zihnija Bašić from Bosnia tells how he had to fight for a long time to be recognized as a war victim after his rapes. He still suffers from the abuse to this day. Oleksiy Sivak from Ukraine has since founded a self-help group. Like his friend Roman Shapovalenko, he was sexually abused by Russian occupying forces. 

Masokolo Lemba from the Congo is also a member of a self-help group. Lemba fled from the war in his home country to Uganda - where survivors of sexual violence are often accused of homosexuality, which is a punishable offense in Uganda. This stigmatization and criminalization make it difficult to cope with the trauma. 

Historian Regina Mühlhäuser is a member of an international research group that investigates sexual violence against men. She says: "If you want to prevent sexual violence against men in war-time, you have to fight it in peace-time. After all, prisons and the military are often breeding grounds for this violence."

Despite their fear of stigmatization and discrimination, the survivors in this film have chosen to tell their stories in order to bring this taboo topic to light.

These are the studies this week that were exhumed from their graves, worked scatological miracles, and drew inspiration from X-rays.First, a diagnosis 200 years in the making confirms, once again, that Napoleon’s retreat from Russia was a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad time. Then: crystal pee, life-giving poo, and the artistic side of radiotherapy. Let’s dive in (to poopy waters)! Bonaparte’s battlers beaten by beetsOf all the classic blunders, the most famous is getting involved in a land war in Asia (source: ). Napoleon Bonaparte’s troops learned this lesson the hard way during their disastrous retreat from Moscow at the wintry tail of 1812, which claimed the lives of 300,000 soldiers—more than half of the French army—largely from exposure and disease.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cards Against Humanity, SpaceX Settle Lawsuit Over Misused Border Land Parcel</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/24/cards-against-humanity-spacex-settle-lawsuit-over-misused-border-land-parcel/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 02:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Way back in Trump’s first term, back when he was still claiming he was going to build some enormous border wall and get Mexico to pay for it (neither happened), the lovely people over at Cards Against Humanity bought a parcel of land along the boarder with the intention of taking every possible action to prevent a wall being built upon it. It was part of a marketing campaign where a percentage of sales of the game would go to buying the land, which eventually happened in 2017. And that’s where things stood for the rest of Trump’s term and all the way up to 2024. No wall was built on the land, Mexico paid for nothing, and the land remained empty.Until, that is, SpaceX decided to dump a bunch of trash on it. The Elon Musk-owned company has a fabrication plant nearby and apparently just decided to use someone else’s property to dump a bunch of construction materials and trash. The irony that a parcel of land that was bought to keep a border wall from being built to keep out foreign trespassers that was instead trespassed upon domestically is not lost on me.Well, CAH sued for $15 million and seemed like it had a very good case. SpaceX must have eventually agreed, as they have now settled the case days before the trial was set to begin.A court document shows that SpaceX admitted it did not ask for or receive permission to use the property. SpaceX admitted that its “contractors cleared the lot and put down gravel,” parked vehicles on the property, and stored construction materials. An Associated Press article yesterday said that “Texas court records show a settlement was reached in the case last month, just weeks before a jury trial was scheduled to begin on Nov. 3.”The game company said a victory at trial wouldn’t have resulted in a better outcome. “A trial would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX,” the company’s statement to Ars said. “Under Texas law, even if we had won at trial (and we would have, given their admission to trespassing), we likely wouldn’t have been able to recoup our legal fees. And SpaceX certainly seemed ready to dramatically outspend us on lawyers.”Given that the details of the settlement are annoyingly confidential, we can’t really suss out just how just this outcome is. But the folks over at CAH seem to be satisfied, so I have to imagine at least a decent amount of money changed hands here. Still, part of the idea here was supposed to be sending money won from Musk to all the donors to the campaign, but it appears the settlement money won’t be enough to do so in an update CAH provided publicly.Remember last year, when  for dumping space garbage all over your land, and then you signed up to collect your share of the proceeds?

The quotes are real. The context is accurate. But Trump called them “fake” and “fraudulent,” and the Reagan Foundation—the institution literally tasked with preserving Reagan’s legacy—backed him up by lying about what their own guy said and even threatening frivolous litigation in support of Trump’s temper tantrum.Now, thanks to Trump’s meltdown, millions more people are watching Reagan’s actual words. And learning that Trump’s entire tariff philosophy directly contradicts what Reagan believed and said.The ad that triggered all this is pretty straightforward. A few weeks ago, Ontario Premier Doug Ford launched a $75 million campaign using clips from a 1987 Ronald Reagan radio address about the evils of tariffs and the benefits of free trade. You can see it here:Ford’s politics are often Trumpian, but he’s not backing down from a stupid trade war. So he pulled Reagan’s own words and ran them as a 60-second spot.The ad campaign is definitely targeting Republicans and business execs. It first ran on the very MAGA Newsmax and the very business-focused Bloomberg, but has been expanding to Fox News (of course), CNBC, CBS, ABC, ESPN and others.Apparently, somewhere this week, Donald Trump saw it, and it made him sad. And when Donald Trump gets sad, he lashes out like a six-year-old. He claimed that the ad was “fake” and because of that he was cutting off all trade negotiations with Canada.If you can’t see that image, it’s Trump spewing on social media:The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs. The ad was for $75,000. They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts. TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJTSo, first off, it’s a bit weird to cut off all negotiations with Canada based on an ad from one province, Ontario, which is run by a politician from a different party than the Prime Minister. But, okay.But the bigger issue is the claim that the Reagan quotes are “fake” or “fraudulent.” They’re not. The Reagan Foundation put out this statement, and the only “misrepresentation” is in the Foundation’s own statement:The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute learned that the Government of Ontario, Canada, created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan delivering his “Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade,” dated April 25, 1987. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter. We encourage you to watch President Reagan’s unedited video on our YouTube channel.So, first off, note the difference between what the Foundation said and what Trump said. The Foundation claims that the ad is “using selective audio” in a way that “misrepresents” Reagan. Trump took that claim (which was already bullshit) and said it means the ad is “fake” and “fraudulent.” It is neither.The Foundation also suggests it might sue, which is laughable. They have no claim here and any attempt to go to court would fail, and fail in an embarrassing manner.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation has gone fully Trumpy—their website is packed with MAGA interviews—and now they’re lying about what Reagan actually said and believed. The institution designed to preserve his legacy is rewriting it to please Donald Trump.It’s only five minutes long. Every quote in the Ontario ad is in there, accurate both in text and in context. The speech was framed around Reagan’s decision to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products in response to Japan dumping below-market semiconductors, which Reagan argued violated an earlier agreement.However, he was quite clear throughout that he was a strong believer in free trade and against tariffs, and he was only doing this, regretfully, in response to Japan violating an earlier trade agreement.Reagan explicitly contradicted Trump’s claim that tariffs are “very important to the national security and economy of the US.” Reagan said the opposite.Incredibly, Trump freaking out and lying about this ad is making many more people watch it and learn what Reagan actually said about tariffs and free trade. Even CNN, which pretty typically just repeats whatever Trump says, is pointing out that Trump’s claims here are nonsense and Reagan very clearly spoke out against tariffs.On top of all this, Canada is now cutting trade deals with China and other countries in Asia. This is effectively pushing our closest ally into the waiting arms of our biggest economic rival.This is stunningly bad policy: a foreseeable disaster stemming from a stupid approach to trade, kicked into overdrive by a presidential temper tantrum over accurate quotes from a politician many in the MAGA world pretend to idolize. Trump lied. The Reagan Foundation lied to back him up. And now Canada is cutting deals with China while the world learns that Reagan explicitly opposed everything Trump claims tariffs accomplish.Congratulations to everyone involved. You’ve Streisanded the world into a history lesson, and handed China a trade partner in the process.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Participating in an Achuar Cleansing Ritual</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5zZhat-OCoA</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5zZhat-OCoA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau traveled deep into the Amazon rainforest to meet the local community and learn about its traditions — even receiving a cleansing ritual from the Achuar, one of the Indigenous groups protecting the rainforest.

Network intelligence company Ookla said its DownDetector service received more than 17 million reports of disrupted services offered by 3,500 organizations. The three biggest countries where reports originated were the US, the UK, and Germany. Snapchat, AWS, and Roblox were the most reported services affected. Ookla said the event was “among the largest internet outages on record for Downdetector.”Amazon said the root cause of the outage was a software bug in software running the DynamoDB DNS management system. The system monitors the stability of load balancers by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the AWS network. A race condition is an error that makes a process dependent on the timing or sequence events that are variable and outside the developers’ control. The result can be unexpected behavior and potentially harmful failures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Science Must Decentralize</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/science-must-decentralize</link><author>Rory Mir</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/network.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:55:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Trump Is Building A Violent, Shadowy Federal Police Force</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/24/how-trump-is-building-a-violent-shadowy-federal-police-force/</link><author>J.

In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked , so now let me send them ,’” Amezcua said.Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.Where the Fallout is FeltThe fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joint Statement on the UN Cybercrime Convention: EFF and Global Partners Urge Governments Not to Sign</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/joint-statement-un-cybercrime-convention-eff-and-global-partners-urge-governments</link><author>Katitza Rodriguez</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/un-cybercrime-1c.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:14:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Dataset for Detecting Nudity Contained Child Sexual Abuse Images</title><link>https://www.404media.co/ai-dataset-for-detecting-nudity-contained-child-sexual-abuse-images/</link><author>Emanuel Maiberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1648757838556-2ca6ec323d55?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDM5fHxkYXJrJTIwY29tcHV0ZXJ8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzYxMzM2NTA5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:11:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A large image dataset used to develop AI tools for detecting nudity contains a number of images of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), according to the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P). The NudeNet dataset, which contains more than 700,000 images scraped from the internet, was used to train an AI image classifier which could automatically detect nudity in an image.

Thousands of you had signed up just by spotting the little email icon. We figured more might be interested if we actually talked about it. We’d upgraded the tech, written a whole post about it, and figured people would start signing up.And then… crickets. For two days straight, the only “new” signup was a test I’d run with my own email address. Which was, you know, not ideal. It was  that no more people wanted to sign up and we’d maxed out on subscribers already. But… that seemed unlikely.Then we got a few reports from people saying they tried to sign up but got error messages. Which is, generally speaking, not what you want.It turns out that we had a little bug: users who were signed into their Techdirt account could sign up for the newsletter. But if you were signed out (as most readers are) well… you got the error. There’s some sort of QA lesson in that, and yes, we should have tested it logged out as well, but there’s always something you miss.All that is to say, we’ve now fixed this, and ever since we did, the signups have been flowing in. So I thought I’d do another quick post and say that, no, really, you can sign up for the emailed daily newsletter if you want it!Also worth noting: a bunch of people said they prefer RSS or just visiting the site directly, and that’s great too. We’ve had full-text RSS feeds for over two decades—long before most sites even understood what they were—and the site itself is always there. The point isn’t to force you into one distribution channel. If anything, we’re doing the opposite: giving you the option to consume Techdirt however you actually want to, rather than locking you into whatever method happens to be most fashionable… or profitable. That’s increasingly rare, and it’s not an accident.We just want you to be able to enjoy Techdirt whichever way works best for you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Edward Wierenga - Can the Divine be a Person or Persons?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIWWH7hpfIc</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NIWWH7hpfIc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 19:00:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Closer To Truth is now on Bluesky!

The AI boom isn’t just about algorithms — it’s about money, power, and a race to build infrastructure on a scale we’ve never seen before. In this video, we break down the circular deals between OpenAI, Nvidia, Amazon, Anthropic, and even Elon Musk’s empire — and ask the hard questions: Who’s paying for this? Where will the electricity come from? And is the industry building a Möbius strip of venture capital and gigawatts that could collapse under its own weight?
We’ll explore:

The spaghetti diagram of AI’s biggest players
OpenAI’s trillion-dollar data center ambitions
Why Nvidia’s demand might not be what it seems
The risk of stranded assets and systemic leverage
How geopolitics and energy constraints could shape the future

If you want to understand the economics behind the hype — and why this might be the biggest corporate investment project in history — watch now.

Doublespeed did not respond to a request for comment, so we don’t know exactly how its service works, but the company appears to be pitching a service designed to circumvent many of the methods social media platforms use to detect inauthentic behavior.

But reading the actual complaint made it clear this is something far more dangerous: Reddit isn’t just going after scrapers. It’s mounting a fundamental attack on the very concept of an open internet, using a twisted reading of copyright law that—if it succeeds—would break how search engines, archives, and the web itself operate.Even if you love Reddit and hate AI, you should be worried about this lawsuit. If it succeeds, it would fundamentally close off most of the open internet.Most reporting on this is not actually explaining the nuances, which require a deeper understanding of the law, but fundamentally, Reddit is NOT arguing that these companies are illegally scraping Reddit, but rather that they are illegally scraping…  (which is not a party to the lawsuit) and in doing so violating the DMCA’s anti-circumvention clause, over content Reddit holds no copyright over. And, then, Perplexity is effectively being sued for linking to Reddit.This is… bonkers on so many levels. And, incredibly, within their lawsuit, Reddit defends its arguments by claiming it’s filing this lawsuit to protect the open internet. It is not. It is doing the exact opposite.It is totally reasonable to be concerned about the burden that data scrapers put on websites, and to talk about ways to deal with them. But that’s not what this lawsuit really is. It’s mostly focused on some companies that effectively have built unofficial APIs for getting search results data out of Google. That can be quite useful in some cases! But also, some of the companies in this space can be fairly sketchy. Reddit leans heavily on the sketchiness of the companies to imply “they’re bad.”But, an open web must mean a programmable web of some sort. Building on other services is a fundamental part of the open web and has always been there. If the building becomes abusive, then there are often technical ways of dealing with it. But here, the “abuse” seems to be Reddit signed a $60 million scraping deal with Google, which was already kinda sketchy.After all, Reddit has a license to the content users post in order to operate the service, but they don’t hold the copyright on it. Indeed, Reddit’s terms state clearly that users retain “any ownership rights you have in Your content.” Because of Reddit’s agreement that it can license content, the deal with Google could sorta squeeze under that term, but that doesn’t give Reddit the right to then sue over users’ copyrights (as it’s doing in this case).Either way, there’s an indication that Reddit has gotten greedy. It’s apparently reopened negotiations with Google recently, seeking more money and traffic. But it also wants money from other AI providers. Apparently, that includes Perplexity, which is a pretty useful AI “answer engine” that lets users select from a variety of underlying LLMs (Perplexity has released its own LLMs, but they were modifications of open source LLMs including Llama (from Meta) and Mistral, a popular open source LLM from France. Thus, while Perplexity has offered its own models, it didn’t train them itself).Because Perplexity is much more focused on being an alternative to a search engine than a traditional “chat bot,” its focus in answering your questions is to actually provide links as sources for the answers it gives. In effect, it combines a traditional search engine with an LLM and it did this before many other chatbot LLMs added web search capabilities (though most now have them).But that means, if an “answer” to a question from a user comes from a Reddit post, Perplexity is likely to link to it, just like a regular search engine. But, Reddit wants to get paid. And because Reddit has become so closed and persnickety about things, it looks like Perplexity may have chosen to use these other data scraping firms’ unofficial Google search results APIs to find Reddit posts and link to them.This is… how the open internet is supposed to work, actually. But Reddit presents it as a sneaky “circumvention.”Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants SerpApi, Oxylabs, and AWMProxy scrape the data from Google’s search results instead. They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them. For example, during a two-week span in July 2025, Defendants SerpApi, Oxylabs, and AWMProxy circumvented Google’s technological control measures and automatedly accessed, without authorization, almost three billion search engine results pages (“SERPs”) containing Reddit text, URLs, images, and videos.That’s Not How Circumvention WorksSo you might notice something weird in the paragraph above. Namely the claim that the API/scraping companies “circumvented Google’s technological control measures.”The fundamental issue is that it says any attempt to “circumvent a technological measure” that tries to protect a copyright-protected work is, itself, copyright infringement. And that’s even if the goal of the circumvention is not even to infringe on the underlying copyright at all. That’s why we’ve seen attempts by companies to use 1201 to, say, block people from using cheaper ink jet cartridges, or getting a cheaper garage door opener. Neither of those sound like copyright issues (because they’re not), but companies tried to abuse 1201 by claiming they put “technological control measures” on those devices, and any “circumvention” should then be seen as infringement.But here, Reddit is doing something even crazier. Because it’s saying that since these companies (allegedly) get around  technological measures, then somehow Reddit can accuse them of violating 1201.Reddit and Google have implemented technological measures that effectively control access to Reddit content. Both companies use advanced technological techniques, as described above, to control unauthorized, automated access to their server systems. These measures, in the ordinary course of their operation, limit the freedom and ability of users to access Reddit content, including by prohibiting automated entities from accessing search engine result pages and scraping search engine results that include Reddit content.Defendants’ actions violate 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(A), under which no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work. Defendants have circumvented these measures in one or more ways, including:a. Avoiding or bypassing Reddit’s measures entirely in order to obtain Reddit’s content and services, and the content authored by its users, that appear in Google search results; andb. Avoiding, removing, deactivating, impairing, and/or bypassing SearchGuard and Google’s other technological control measures by using devices, systems, processes, and/or protocols, including large-volume proxy networks, to improperly gain access to Google Search results.Let’s break this down, because we have to look at how crazy this is.They’re saying that these companies are “avoiding or bypassing”  TCMs. But, the way they’re doing that is by . You  claim that it is “circumventing a TCM” to get the same content… from Google. That’s crazy.Even crazier is that they’re arguing that the defendants are circumventing  TCM, even though Google isn’t even a party.They’re making this claim over content that Reddit holds no copyright over. The copyright remains with the original creator. Reddit holds a license, but a license does not grant Reddit the right to sue over that copyright.Each one of these ideas is crazy. All three of them together is ludicrous. Reddit is claiming that these companies violated copyright law by (1) avoiding Reddit and (2) getting the content from publicly available Google searches over (3) content that Reddit has no copyright over.And somehow that’s supposed to be copyright infringement.This Is Not Protecting the Open InternetEven more obnoxiously, Reddit crowns itself a protector of the open internet with this nonsense:Because Reddit has always believed in the open internet, it takes its role as a steward of its users’ communities, discussions, and authentic human discourse seriously.Elsewhere in the lawsuit, it says:As articulated in its Public Content Policy, Reddit believes in an open internet, but it “do[es] not believe that third parties have a right to misuse public content just because it’s public.”If that’s the case, then… you don’t believe in an open internet. Text and data mining is a part of the open internet. Building on the work of others is part of the open internet. You can’t just claim “we support the open internet, but not if we say you’re misusing it.” It’s not your call.Yes, there are copyright restrictions on what you can do with others’ content, but (again) Reddit has no copyright interest here. And it can’t even legitimately claim a “circumvention” of a TCM just because these companies got the same data elsewhere.This Isn’t Even About TrainingSome people will still insist this is bad because they hate all AI training based on scraping, but that’s not even what’s happening here. We discussed this a bit in our last piece on cutting off the open internet. It’s one thing to argue that you want to block your content from being trained upon, but it’s a wholly different thing to say “you can’t retrieve this page based on a user search.” That latter scenario is the basis of how search engines exist online, which are fundamental to an open web.But, as Perplexity notes in its response to the lawsuit (ironically, in the Perplexity subreddit on Reddit), that’s exactly what Reddit is looking to block:What does Perplexity actually do with Reddit content? We summarize Reddit discussions, and we cite Reddit threads in answers, just like people share links to posts here all the time. Perplexity invented citations in AI for two reasons: so that you can verify the accuracy of the AI-generated answers, and so you can follow the citation to learn more and expand your journey of curiosity.And that’s what people use Perplexity for: journeys of curiosity and learning.  When they visit Reddit to read your content it’s because they want to read it, and they read more than they would have from a Google search.The company also notes that Reddit demanded Perplexity license its data, but Perplexity explained to them (as mentioned above) that they don’t train their own LLM so they don’t need to license data for training.Here’s where we push back. Reddit told the press we ignored them when they asked about licensing. Untrue. Whenever anyone asks us about content licensing, we explain that Perplexity, as an application-layer company, does not train AI models on content. Never has. So it is impossible for us to sign a license agreement to do so.A year ago, after explaining this, Reddit insisted we pay anyway, despite lawfully accessing Reddit data. Bowing to strong arm tactics just isn’t how we do business. For what it’s worth, Perplexity also claims that this is part of Reddit’s plan to “extort” more money from Google.This is an Anti-Open Internet LawsuitIf this lawsuit succeeds, it would signal a huge destruction of the open internet. It would fundamentally make it impossible for search engines to work without licensing all content. It would, in effect, close off huge parts of the open internet to only those with the largest wallets.Beyond that, it would extend our understanding of Section 1201’s anti-circumvention provisions to absurdity. Saying that  your site is circumvention? Crazy. Saying that (allegedly) “bypassing”  technological measures lets  sue? Absurd. And saying that you can do all that over content you don’t even hold the copyright on? Preposterously stupid.If this lawsuit succeeds, it would open up a cottage industry of frivolous lawsuits, while greatly diminishing the nature of the open web.I’ve long considered Reddit one of the “good” examples of how narrow, more focused, communities can operate. On our latest Ctrl-Alt-Speech, we talked about how it’s one of the examples of the “good” parts of the internet. I know and respect many people at Reddit, including on their legal team.But I just don’t get this lawsuit. It seems massively destructive to the open internet in what appears to be a very misguided and mis-targeted attempt to shake down extra licensing revenue. There are better ways to do this, and I hope that Reddit reconsiders its approach.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/24/daily-deal-3-in-1-magnetic-wireless-charging-pad/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:43:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad integrates three charging modules for cell phones, headphones, and watches—a maximum power of 15W for cell phone charging, 5W for Airpods charging, and 2.5W for Apple Watch charging.

The podcaster first became a household name by encouraging young men to improve their income, fitness and social status if they wish to dominate women.But what often goes unquestioned are the equally influential, witty videos, memes and podcasts targeted at young women, that repackage the same patriarchal, conservative and hyper-capitalist values pushed onto men only with a feminist guise.You may not have heard of the late Kevin Samuels or Shera Seven, but they reigned as king and queen of viral relationship content, offering advice to their largely black international audiences on how to succeed in transactional dating.In their world view, a man’s value lies in his wallet and a woman’s in her physical appeal. These archaic ideas are thriving in new media spaces, where secular influencers refer to religious ideals of female purity and male ambition to rank human beings as either “high” or “low value.”So-called slay queens are the glamorous young women who prioritise relationships with men who can fund their lifestyles and encourage others to ‘choose finance over romance’ with ‘broke men’.Increasingly, this viral content is not just aimed at young adults, but at anyone single. These videos and podcasts have found a special home amongst black internet users especially.American influencers like Tate, Shera Seven and Kevin Samuels are at the helm of a world of DIY podcasts and Instagram accounts filled with extreme relationship hot takes, consumed across black America, black Britain and cosmopolitan African cities like Nairobi, Lagos and Johannesburg.It is the ubiquity of this content that led me to the world’s most unequal country, where the burden falls heaviest on women.Meet South Africa’s Slay QueenAt the centre of South Africa’s gender war is a controversial digital persona: the slay queen. Once a term of empowerment, it’s now frequently used as a derogatory slur aimed at almost any young woman who dares post a selfie on a night out. Although the title carries a stigma, the women I met in clubs and bars seeking wealthy men in Johannesburg were more than happy to wear it.So-called slay queens are the glamorous young women who prioritise relationships with men who can fund their lifestyles and encourage others to ‘choose finance over romance’ with ‘broke men’.In South Africa, slay queens are both adored and despised. They’ve become cult figures in an ongoing digital gender war. The digital gender divide between young men and women is a global phenomenon, but in South Africa, the divide is stark.In South Africa, slay queens are both adored and despised. They’ve become cult figures in an ongoing digital gender war.Johannesburg is a modern city wrestling with traditional values, with young men and women each demanding the opposite sex meet conservative ideals they themselves have little interest in fulfilling. In the city, I met young people navigating a cocktail of competing ideals.Young women viewed monogamy as virtuous, while young men invoked polygamy as a cultural right protected by law. Some men demanded women take on traditional roles, despite being absent fathers themselves. At the same time, many women wanted conservative men to be traditional providers, while retaining the freedoms of modern womanhood.These gender tensions unfold against a backdrop of chronic unemployment and extreme inequality. In post-apartheid South Africa, both black men and women have embraced American hustle culture, yet most remain locked out of the country’s wealth. Rather than confronting systemic injustice, many have turned their frustrations inward against each other with devastating consequences for black women.The country has high rates of femicide, with three women a day killed by a sexual partner. Self-described slay queen Habiba Makgatho told me that high levels of domestic violence, combined with the absence of men supporting childcare or household needs, have made women more pragmatic in their dealings with men. Simply put, women say they can no longer afford the cost of loving men.For many, this economic and emotional disillusionment has driven the rise of transactional relationships and elevated the slay queen persona. However, the lifestyle is accused of blurring the line between hook-up culture and sex work.In Johannesburg, men are increasingly being asked to pay an allowance called ‘mavuso’ after sexual encounters. Meanwhile, in local tabloids and on male-dominated podcasts, slay queens are painted as femme fatales involved in crimes like drugging, robbing, and extorting men.The term slay queen is increasingly being used to justify gender-based violence, with male gangs villainising any female target as a slay queen.But beneath this backlash lies a deeper danger.The term slay queen is increasingly being used to justify gender-based violence, with male gangs villainising any female target as a slay queen.On closer look the so-called slay queen is a fiction, summoned by men, content creators courting controversy and influencers in the manosphere who build audiences maligning women.More disturbingly, the title has helped mask a darker reality: a sexual pyramid scheme. Beneath the glamorous hierarchy of self-described slay queens appears a network of women allegedly enticing their peers into more direct sex work and trafficking them against their will.Johannesburg is a city built on the gold rush of 1886. More than a century later, not everything that glitters here is gold.Unreported World: Special Substack seriesEach newsletter article – written by our award-winning journalists – will examine and reflect on the extraordinary episodes bringing unique insight.https://channel4news.substack.com/]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Putin - His Rise &amp; Rule</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQsCSMwjUsY</link><author>The People Profiles</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wQsCSMwjUsY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:02:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6TPU-PvTMvqgzC_AM7_uA">The People Profiles</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the incredible, decades-long journey of Vladimir Putin, the figure who has dominated Russian politics since the turn of the millennium. This deep-dive biography traces his remarkable rise to power, from his origins as a KGB officer in Leningrad and East Germany to becoming President of Russia and one of the world's most influential leaders.

We analyse the key moments of the Putin era, including the consolidation of power, the management of Russia's economy fuelled by oil and gas, the suppression of the oligarchs, and major geopolitical events. Understand the shift from the chaos of the post-Soviet 1990s under Boris Yeltsin to the centralized, authoritarian state of modern Russia.

Discover his foreign policy initiatives, from the Chechen wars to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We examine his relationships with the West, NATO, and other global players, highlighting his campaign to re-establish Russia as a global power. This video is essential viewing for anyone seeking to understand the man, the Kremlin's strategies, the Russian Federation, and the future of international relations.

This week, we discuss Pavlovian Chartbeat response, when to say "cum," and the wave of making things for humans, by humans. Right now I’m in the midst of upgrading a bunch of my podcasting and related gear. I’m using the same kinda cheap to midrange web cam I got when we first launched 404 Media. My mic is fine but now that a fair number of people listen to the pod, and we want to grow it, it’s time to invest in some new tech. Jason has already done this, I’m more following his lead. I used to be very into cameras, tech, gadgets, mics, but it’s been a few years. Because the four of us are spread all over, we can’t do the popular aesthetic of everyone sitting on a chair or sofa chatting in a podcast studio. That stuff obviously performs better on video/YouTube, which is where podcast discovery often happens now. But we can try to make our remotely recorded podcast look as good as we can.

This happened during a year which has been one of the safest (in terms of crime rates) in Chicago’s recent history. And, of course, actual crime rates were  beside the point. The real reason for Trump’s declaration of war was his ongoing grudge with any major city or US state whose residents have voted against him in recent elections. A month later, Trump amped up his war plans by calling for the arrest of Illinois governor JB Pritzker and the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson. Then he did the actual war stuff, sending National Guard members from Illinois (already legally problematic) and [wtaf]  to the city of Chicago to do the stuff these troops have done elsewhere… which has basically amounted to performing policing of areas for literal trash, filing paperwork for federal cops, shitting in humvees, and dealing with the uncomfortable reality of working for a logistics-last administration that amuses itself by moving its toy soldiers to wherever the vibe takes it.U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday criticized the media and politicians, including Gov. JB Pritzker, for “trying to demonize” federal immigration agents and the Trump administration’s enforcement operations, and she urged citizens to thank law enforcement officers and “cook a meal for their families.”But let’s go back to the first sentence. No one needs to  to “demonize” ICE officers. They do it to every day of the week. All anyone needs to do to cast demon-esque aspersions is simply  on their actions. Noem’s comments continue from here, however, laying her chin out like she’s the straight man in a bit she’s not currently aware she’s participating in. Every statement offers up her chin like a regular Glass  Jane, just patiently waiting for someone to connect directly and send her spiraling to the canvas. “I want to speak directly to the American people today and remind them and recall the facts that we are focused on the worst of the worst, bringing these individuals to justice. We’re not going to let individuals terorize our streets anymore and we’re not going to let them make victims out of families that live in this country,” Noem said.“Since January, the Department of Homeland Security has arrested over 480,000 criminal illegal aliens,” she said. “Seventy percent of those individuals have criminal charges against them or have been convicted of those criminal charges.”That can’t possibly be correct. In fact, it . The first clue is that Kristi Noem is saying it. The second clue is the actual data, which shows that more than 65% of people booked by ICE have never been convicted. And that means there’s no way 70% have either been convicted or have current criminal charges because there are simply not enough people left.If Noem wants to include the immigration charges arrestees are now facing, that’s fine. That might make everything add up to 70% (but it does make you wonder why it’s not ), but it doesn’t add any credence to her assertion that ICE is focused on the “worst of the worst.” An immigration offense is a  offense. If Noem wants to pretend overstaying a visa is the criminal equivalent of felony assault, she’s welcome to do that. Pritzker and the media at large (who Noem includes in this free-association venting) are under no obligation to play along with the administration’s narrative. The media did push back a bit as Noem attacked them for not showing respect, if not abject adoration, for ICE officers. When asked about arrests for low-level crimes not exactly being the “worst of worst” they were told ICE was gunning for, Noem said this: “We have laws and we don’t get to pick which ones matter and which ones don’t,” she said. “Every single one of our laws has been put in place for a reason and, therefore, will be enforced.”This person works for a man who was convicted on 34 counts in a felony trial and yet — thanks to the Supreme Court — is somehow back in the Oval Office. Her employer is also a man who has declared he can break pretty much any law he wants to and still get away with it because of who he is and the immunity he has access to. Twenty exhausting minutes later, Noem finished up by targeting the Illinois governor yet again. “Gov. Pritzker in Illinois is putting his people in danger every day by going against us and not working with us to make sure that we’re detaining individuals who have criminal charges against themor have been convicted and then re-releasing them out on the streets,” she said.US President Donald Trump issued pardons or commutations for more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the US Capitol riot four years ago.Suck it, ICE. You’re demons. Get demonized. You and you alone have earned all the hate you’re getting. The same goes for you, Kristi. The sooner you leave office and get back to murdering your kids’ pets, the better off this nation will be. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The worst German attack against Britain #ww2 #worldwar2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/udm63F8B5KA</link><author>WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/udm63F8B5KA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 16:06:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSGFY2a_DYK8plQI_fcY_Xg">Podcast - WW2 Pod</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk

If consciousness is 100% physical, we would have to conclude that the same kind of consciousness that we experience as humans can be generated by non-biological entities (eventually). Conversely, if non-biological consciousness would somehow, someday, prove impossible, then consciousness would have to embed some nonphysical aspect. But how would we ever know?

Is it possible to bore a tunnel through one die that’s big enough for the other to slide through? Perhaps your instinct is to say “Surely not!” If so, you’re not alone. In the late 1600s, an unidentified person placed a bet to that effect with Prince Rupert of the Rhine.

Christmas 1979. Soviet armor pours across the Afghan border towards Kabul as helicopters secure the mountain passes through the Hindukush mountains. In Moscow, the Politburo has decided to save Afghanistan’s communist government from collapse. Afghan rebels have taken up arms against the unpopular regime and control most of the countryside. But the Red Army leadership doubts it can pacify the country - so why did the Soviet Union invade Afghanistan?

But an increasing number are breaking the silence and fighting for respect and their rights – with words, music and physical strength. Activist Usha Vishwakarma trains women in the art of self-defense. Many members of her “Red Brigade” have themselves suffered sexual violence. Rapper JQueen channels her anger into powerful rap songs as a solo artist or with her all-female band “Wild Wild Women.” And student Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu campaigns to get more women to enter politics. They all represent a new generation pushing back against traditional gender roles. They demand respect and personal safety despite structural barriers and societal expectations. Their resistance shows that change begins at the point where women empower themselves.

Pre-merger, executives promise all manner of amazing synergies and deal benefits. Post-merger, not only to those benefits generally never arrive, the debt from the acquisition spree usually results in significant layoffs, lower quality product, and higher rates for consumers. The Time Warner Discovery disaster was the poster child for this phenomenon.“Major job cuts have been expected even before the Skydance Media-Paramount Global deal closed, as part of Ellison and his team’s goal of slashing upwards of $2 billion in costs. Previously, the company had been targeting layoffs by early November. The new round of cuts is expected to eliminate around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional layoffs internationally.I’m sure the longstanding employees at CBS and Paramount are particularly thrilled about the Ellisons overpaying for Bari Weiss’ blog, then promoting a woman with no real experience in journalism to be the new head of CBS News. As we’ve noted, that effort to bring even more right wing trolling and billionaire-ass kissing to a fairly saturated media market is likely to be a major headache. The Ellisons, in their bid to dominate U.S. media, also have their eye on acquiring whatever is left of Time Warner, which is expected to cost them somewhere around $60 billion. Historically these kinds of media domination plays never end well (just ask AT&T), so you can expect significantly more layoffs as this weird combination of fail-upward brunchlords and nepobabies try to navigate a tumultuous market they don’t really understand. It used to be that companies planning for harmful, pointless mergers had to at least make a fleeting effort to justify the pointless consolidation. But during the Trump era all you have to do is kiss the idiot king’s ring and any and all pointless consolidation gets the green light. All of the costs of those harms will, of course, be borne by consumers and employees in the months and years to come. And because we’ve let our journalism and media consolidate in the hands of just a few billionaires — the media’s coverage of itself generally doesn’t honestly reflect any of this, propping up billionaire efforts to keep making the same mistakes over and over again for some tax cuts and a temporary stock boost.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elm &amp; Open Source: What&apos;s Next? • Evan Czaplicki &amp; Kris Jenkins</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TklYhw0Kl58</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TklYhw0Kl58?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:26:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024.

A number of high-profile companies have chosen to list elsewhere, fundraising has been at 30-year lows and in September it slipped out of the world’s top 20 listing destinations. 

How did one of the world’s most storied exchanges and Europe’s biggest equity market begin to lose its appeal as an IPO hotspot? We look at the factors contributing to London’s stalling market and what reforms are planned to try and address it.

Now, DC Comics is notoriously draconian when it comes to policing its IP, trademarks included, but this one was fairly ridiculous, as the UKIPO pointed out. There is no actual branding comparison here. No color schemes or tradedress that would point someone to Wonder Woman. Despite that, DC took the case to the UK High Court. While we didn’t report on the result at the time, the High Court rejected DC’s appeal and affirmed the decision by the UKIPO.Those who do not learn from past mistakes are doomed to repeat them, as the saying goes. This time, back in April, DC Comics had sent C&D notices to a French woman who runs an app dedicated to providing family guidance called “Wondermum.”“When I got the letter, I rang my close friends and said: ‘Very funny, guys,’ thinking it was an April fool,” she said. “Then I contacted the lawyers’ office and realised it was no joke. They told me DC Comics objected to the name Wondermum.”Sobéron, 43, who visits schools to talk about bullying, is a hero to parents and children in Caen in Normandy, where her company is based. The app provides local listings for family activities and atéliers (workshops) as well as advice and a chatroom. She insists her creation bears no resemblance to the fictional Wonder Woman.She’s absolutely right about that last bit. Nothing in the app, from color schema to its logo, looks anything remotely like the branding or iconography for Wonder Woman. Like… not even close. If you think the following images from the Google Play Store in any way call Wonder Woman to mind, you have a problem and should seek professional help.So, fast forward six months and this idiotic fight is still going on. Sobéron has reportedly lost nearly 20 lbs due to all the stress surrounding this battle and she has had to spend a decent chunk of money to retain legal representation for this battle that never should have been. This is how trademark bullying works, as we’ve said many times. The practice relies on both fear and disparate legal warchests so that the bully gets its way, no matter how unjust that outcome is.Sobéron has had to setup a crowdfunding page for help with her legal bills as a result.Anne-Laure Boileau, Sobéron’s lawyer, said she had been accused of registering and using a trademark that DC Comics – which is owned by Warner Bros and also home to Batman and Superman – says conflicts with its Wonder Woman trademark.“It basically criticises the similarities between the two trademarks but the only similarity is the prefix ‘wonder’. Beyond this prefix and beyond the reference to women, there are no visual or graphic similarities, and above all, we are dealing with concepts that are completely different,” Boileau told French television.This is a woman attempting to build a business around helping parents and children alike. The name came from Sobéron’s daughter, in the wake of a death in their family, in which she referred to her mother as a “wonder mum.” who DC Comics is attempting to drain of money and time, applying stress and pressure over a trademark concern that simply doesn’t exist. It’s remarkable just how often DC Comics becomes the villain in these stories. But, hey, at least this time DC isn’t trying to fight a trademark battle over the gravestone of an abused child.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the U.S. Is Flying Bombers Near Venezuela</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JuGpYqPI60k</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JuGpYqPI60k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 02:44:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. sent B-1 bombers to the Caribbean just a week after flying B-52 bombers near Venezuela.

Head over to https://www.patreon.com/c/kermodeandmayo/membership to sign up.

More films. More opinions. More recommendations. More bickering. More wittering. This is where Kermode & Mayo’s Take gets bigger, longer and uncut. As a subscriber, you’ll get ad-free listening, weekly VIDEO bonus episodes of Take Two in 4k*, and the chance to be properly involved in the nonsense — through polls, chats, newsletters, and the occasional bad joke that really shouldn’t have been read out.

It’s a space for those of you who don’t just want to hear the Take, but want to be part of it. Maybe you’ve shouted at us through your headphones, certain we’d missed the point of a film (Mark), or simply wanted Simon to get a word in edgeways. Maybe you just want more film chat, more recommendations, and more of us trying — and failing — to keep to time.

We want you to be at the heart of this so contact us and let us know what you’d like to see and hear on Patreon, and we’ll do our best. 

Quick note: If you’re a paid subscriber on Apple or Supporting Cast, those subscriptions aren’t going anywhere, so you can continue as a subscriber there if you’d like. However, we invite you to join us on Patreon to access all of the new content and benefits!

What’s included on Patreon?
The membership includes two paid tiers — Vanguardista and Ultra Vanguardista.

Vanguardista
Weekly Take Two Bonus Episode (audio-only): Because clearly one dose of us a week isn’t enough. Take Two is our subscriber-only show: a whole extra hour of reviews, tangents, and assorted nonsense. You’ll also get features like One Frame Back, Weekend Watchlist/Notlist, plus Questions Schmestions, where you send in queries and we provide… let’s say “answers.

Ad-Free Listening: Both Kermode & Mayo’s Take and Take Two, without the interruptions. Just us. Talking. For longer.

Chat Rooms: Access member-only chat rooms to discuss films, telly, and assorted nonsense with fellow fans, the Redactors, and, if we’re feeling reckless, the occasional drop-in from us.

Ultra Vanguardista
Everything from Vangurdista:

Weekly Take Two Bonus Episode (audio-only)

Ad-Free Listening

Chat Rooms

PLUS…

2 x Take Ultra livestream shows (per month): Our brand-new, fully live show featuring more reviews, recommendations of what to watch, audience opinions, and our take on the internet’s hottest (and coldest) takes. You’ll be part of the action, too — and if you can’t join us live, recordings will be available in both audio and video.

Monthly Newsletter: The Redactor's Roundup provides a round-up of the last month, a glimpse of what’s coming next, and whatever film news caught their eye before we nicked it for ourselves.

And I don’t think they plan to.”Competing to be America’s number one cropSoya bean farming has grown so fast in recent decades it now competes with corn as America’s number one crop.It has also become America’s number one agricultural export, more valuable than beef, pork or dairy. And half of those soya bean exports had been going to China.In Trump’s first term, the Chinese cut off American farms as punishment for the first wave of tariffs. Washington was forced to raise a $22bn bailout and eventually struck a deal with China.‘Not a whole lot of hope’Now, Midwestern farming families are facing the same crisis again.Brady Holst, Luke’s brother, is vice-chairman of the Illinois Soybean Association and says that farmers in the state are now worried about bankruptcies.“There’s not a whole lot of hope for even a quick fix. Even if China starts buying tomorrow, there’s a huge crop out there that needs to be moved,” he says.Western Illinois is MAGA country, and many of the local republican politicians dance carefully between pledging allegiance to the White House while also pleading for financial aid or, more critically, a new deal with China to restart trade.Down the road in the city of Macomb, the local university has a huge agricultural campus, with its own Frat House. Its president is Jace Green: a young, charismatic, sixth generation farmer who believes in the land, the Lord, and President Trump.Green, like so many farmers in the Midwest, can rhapsodise at length about the values of American farming and the faith he has in the President. But it’s hard for him to square the current crises with those more fundamental beliefs.“I’ve just got that unwavering faith in the Lord and I believe that Donald Trump is going to get us out of this one way or another,” he says.He quickly adds: “He put us in it.”“But I think that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.”Richard Stern from the Heritage Foundation – a conservative think-tank with huge influence in Washington – says American farmers need to wean themselves off China.“What we’re going to do is expand markets, free up trade, so [farmers] have markets they can go to where [they] don’t have to feel bad about it,” without “funding and feeding the Chinese Communist Party.”He refutes the idea that farmers have become collateral damage in the trade war and insists in the end they’ll be better off.The Heritage Foundation sees the trade war in two halves.First, that the US and American companies stop trading with China. Second, that tariffs levelled against friendly allies are only a stopgap to win better terms for American-made products or US agriculture.The impact of tariffs vs taxesAt the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Mary Lovely suggests that the income generated by tariffs is changing the US tax base, in a way that hurts Trump’s MAGA voters the most.“Tariffs are highly regressive taxes,” she says.“They’re taxes that fall more heavily on working and middle-class families than they do on the wealthy.“And we are having a transformation of our tax system, where we’re relying less heavily on income taxes and corporate taxes and more heavily on tariffs.”Lovely also says she worries the White House had not anticipated how forensic the Chinese could be.“China has learned a lot since the first trade war. The game has broadened and the extent to which the Chinese are playing it has increased in its rapidity and in its sophistication,” she says.Her view is that US farmers will have to look at switching to another crop to protect themselves.“I think people are rather sceptical that any deal will be done or that these relationships will return to normal,” she says.“And that lack of hope is a real challenge for farmers.“They can’t continue to grow beans for a country that isn’t going to ever buy them again.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Labneh sandwich is GOATED!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BpAqr0S6-SA</link><author>Middle Eats</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BpAqr0S6-SA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 18:36:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWj_rUMGYCP0DjffybE2nbg">Middle Eats</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Leave a comment with any recipe requests you'd like to see me cook.

To what extent are Russian interests present within American foreign policy? And - could there be a connection between the answers to these two questions?

US President Donald Trump has had ties to Russia for decades. In this documentary, former KGB, FBI and CIA employees offer insights into the world of espionage, the Cold War and Trump's extensive network of connections to Russia.

During the Cold War, numerous Russian agents infiltrated a variety of political and economic organizations in the US. In addition to industrial espionage, the missions also focused on establishing relationships with influential political figures.

Trump's ties to Russia date back to this period. In 1987, he traveled to Moscow with his then-wife, Ivana, to negotiate a deal to build a luxury hotel there. Semion Mogilevich, head of the Russian mafia, was one of the first investors in New York's Trump Tower. While campaigning for president in 2016, Donald Trump was simultaneously pursuing plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. 

Investigations into possible Kremlin interference in the presidential election reveal that more than a dozen members of the Republican campaign team had ties to Russia. And the war against Ukraine further complicates the situation: Russian President Vladimir Putin would have a keen interest in an ally who could weaken Ukraine and help him win.

--

In 2018, a nonprofit gave every adult in the Ahenyo village $500. Most families had lived in extreme poverty for generations, and this sum was roughly equivalent to their annual salaries. The money came with no strings attached to how it could be spent. Would this lift villagers out of poverty or be another failed philanthropic endeavor? Explore aid programs and how they address people's needs.

It’s an idea that runs counter to the materialist worldview we’re all taught in school. But the outer edges of scientific inquiry bleed into what can only be called ‘magic.’ With a uniquely science-backed approach, parapsychologist Dean Radin explores the "magical" elements of consciousness including telepathy, spell casting, conjuring spirits, and more.

Radin's book, "The Science of Magic: How the Mind Weaves the Fabric of Reality", is on sale now: https://amzn.to/3KXvPd7

Dean Radin is an American parapsychologist. Following a bachelor and master's degree in electrical engineering and a PhD in educational psychology Radin worked at Bell Labs, as a researcher at Princeton University and the University of Edinburgh, and was a faculty member at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

We know what his investments are. We know what he did before.. We don’t want that.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Nostr Web – decentralized website hosting on Nostr</title><link>https://nweb.shugur.com/</link><author>karihass</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:20:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

They analyzed 31 websites for SIIA tools, and found that they received a combined 21 million visits a month, with up to four million visits in one month.Chiara Puglielli and Anne Craanen, the authors of the research paper, used SimilarWeb to identify a common group of sites that shared content, audiences, keywords and referrals. They then used the social media monitoring tool Brandwatch to find mentions of those sites and tools on X, Reddit, Bluesky, YouTube, Tumblr, public pages on  and Facebook, forums, blogs and review sites, according to the paper. “We found 410,592 total mentions of the keywords between 9 June 2020 and 3 July 2025, and used Brandwatch’s ability to separate mentions by source in order to find which sources hosted the highest volumes of mentions,” they wrote. The easiest place to find SIIA tools was through simple web searches. “Searches on Google, Yahoo, and Bing all yielded at least one result leading the user to SIIA technology within the first 20 results when searching for ‘deepnude,’ ‘nudify,’ and ‘undress app,’” the authors wrote. Last year, 404 Media saw that Google was also advertising these apps in search results. But Bing surfaces the tools most readily: “In the case of Bing, the first results for all three searchers were SIIA tools.” These weren’t counting advertisements on the search engines that the websites would have paid for, but were organic search results surfaced by the engines’ crawlers and indexing.X was another massively popular way these tools spread, they found: “Of 410,592 total mentions between June 2020 and July 2025, 289,660 were on X, accounting for more than 70 percent of all activity.” A lot of these were bots. “A large volume of traffic appeared to be inorganic, based on the repetitive style of the usernames, the uniformity of posts, and the uniformity of profile pictures,” Craanen told 404 Media. “Nevertheless, this activity remains concerning, as its volume is likely to attract new users to these tools, which can be employed for activities that are illegal in several contexts.” One major spike in mentions of the tools on social media happened in early 2023 on Tumblr, when a woman posted about her experience being a target of sexual harassment from those very same tools. As targets of malicious deepfakes have said over and , the price of speaking up about one’s own harassment, or even objecting to the harassment of others, is the risk of drawing more attention and harassment to themselves. Another spike on X in 2023 was likely the result of bot advertisements for a single SIIA tool, Craanen said, and the spike was a result of those bots launching. X has rules against “unwanted sexual conduct and graphic objectification” and “inauthentic media,” but the platform remains one of the most significant places where tools for making that content are disseminated and advertised.  Apps and sites for making malicious deepfakes have never been more common or easier to find. There have been several incidents where schoolchildren have used “undress” apps on their classmates, including last year when a Washington state high school was rocked by students using AI to take photos from other children’s Instagram accounts and “undress” around seven of their underage classmates, which police characterized as a possible sex crime against children. In 2023, police arrested two middle schoolers for allegedly creating and sharing AI-generated nude images of their 12 and 13 year old classmates, and  the preteens used an application to make the images. A  from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that 40 percent of students and 29 percent of teachers said they know of an explicit deepfake depicting people associated with their school being shared in the past school year. The “Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks” (TAKE IT DOWN) Act, passed earlier this year, requires platforms to report and remove synthetic sexual abuse material, and after years of state-by-state legislation around deepfake harassment is the first federal-level law to attempt to confront the problem. But critics of that law have said it carries a serious risk of chilling legitimate speech online.“The persistence and accessibility of SIIA tools highlight the limits of current platform moderation and legal frameworks in addressing this form of abuse. Relevant laws relating to takedowns are not yet in full effect across the jurisdictions analysed, so the impact of this legislation cannot yet be fully known,” the ISD authors wrote. “However, the years of public awareness and regulatory discussion around these tools, combined with the ease with which users can still discover, share and deploy these technologies suggests that takedowns cannot be the only tool used to counter their proliferation. Instead, effective mitigation requires interventions at multiple points in the SIIA life cycle—disrupting not only distribution but also discovery and demand. Stronger search engine safeguards, proactive content-blocking on major platforms, and coordinated international policies are essential to reducing the scale of harm.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meet the &quot;unicorn of the sea,&quot; aka Narwhals 💛 #NationalGeographic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1_cODkz58vY</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1_cODkz58vY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Often called "unicorns of the sea," narwhals are uniquely adapted to Arctic waters. They migrate with the seasonal formation and melting of sea ice, travel in small pods, and can dive nearly 4,900 feet (1,500 meters) in search of food beneath the ice. Their elusive nature makes every sighting remarkable, a fleeting glimpse into one of the ocean’s most mysterious lives.

A shirtless man picks up a can of compressed air from the workbench and sprays it. He’s tinkering with a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. At one point he squints at a piece of paper, as if he is reading a set of instructions. Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses are the tech giant’s main attempt at bringing augmented reality to the masses. The glasses can take photos, record videos, and may soon use facial recognition to identify people. Meta’s glasses come with a bright LED light that illuminates whenever someone hits record. The idea is to discourage stalkers, , or just anyone from filming people without their consent. Or at least warn people nearby that they are. Meta has designed the glasses to not work if someone covers up the LED with tape.That protection is what the man in the workshop is circumventing. This is Bong Kim, a hobbyist who modifies Meta Ray-Ban glasses for a small price. Eventually, after more screeching, he is successful: he has entirely disabled the white LED that usually shines on the side of Meta’s specs. The glasses’ functions remain entirely intact; the glasses look as-new. People just won’t know the wearer is recording.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump orders ‘tremendous’ sanctions amid frustration with Putin over Ukraine war</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/trump-orders-tremendous-sanctions-amid-frustration-with-putin-over-ukraine-war</link><author>Channel 4 News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 12:32:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump is ordering more sanctions on Russia as he says he is losing patience with Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.Trump says his sanctions targeting Russian oil companies are ‘tremendous’ and is also threatening more action on financial institutions that do business with the energy firms.Meanwhile, the EU is also announcing fresh sanctions including a ban on Russian liquified natural gas exports.Russian attacks in Ukraine are not slowing down, with drones hitting several locations this week including a kindergarten in Kharkiv.

Lots of manual searching, opening windows & tabs, scrolling, and ultimately copying & pasting into a document editor.Surf is a desktop app meant for simultaneous research and thinking to minimize the grunt work. It’s made of two parts:1) A multi-media library where you can save and organize files and webpages into collections called Notebooks.2) A LLM-powered smart document which you can auto-generate using the context from any stored page, tab or entire notebook. This document contains deep links back to the source material — like a page of a PDF or timestamp in a YouTube video. Unlike Deep Research products (or NotebookLMs chat) the entire thing is editable. The user also stays in the loop.With a technology like AI, context / data is proving to be king. We think it should stay under the user’s control, with minimal lock in: where you can own & export, and plug & play with different models. That’s why Surf is:- Open Source on GitHub
- Open (& Local Data): the data saved in Surf is stored on your local machine in open and accessible formats and mostly works offline.
- Open Model Choice: you can choose which models you use with Surf, and can add custom & Local LLMsEarly users include students & researchers who are learning and doing thematic research using Surf.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fundamentals of DevOps &amp; Software Delivery • Yevgeniy &quot;Jim&quot; Brikman &amp; Kief Morris • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyz_2lELqG8</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zyz_2lELqG8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 12:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

DESCRIPTION
Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman, author of "Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery", discusses his journey from app developer to DevOps advocate, triggered by LinkedIn's deployment crisis that required freezing all product development for months. The discussion with Kief Morris explores the practical definition of DevOps as efficient software delivery methodology, the relationship between infrastructure as code and application orchestration tools, the necessity of frameworks over custom wrapper scripts, and emerging paradigms including infrastructure from code, infrastructure as graph models, and interactive runbooks.

Jim emphasizes that while new approaches are interesting, maturity and standardization in existing tools often provides more value than constantly chasing new technologies.

It permeates the air, soil, and even our bodies. The problem is getting worse, and yet the plastics industry is increasing production.

Environmental lawyer Steven Feit reveals that plastics are the petroleum industry’s growth strategy in the 21st century, even as the world moves away from fossil fuels as an energy source. Sarah Jeanne Royer, an oceanographer, shows the damage microplastics are doing to the coasts of Hawaii. Sharon Lavigne, a retired teacher, fights against pollution and environmental racism in her city, which is home to some of the largest plastic production facilities in the US. The film also follows a photojournalist raising awareness about the problems being caused by single-use plastics in his native Kenya, and lobbyists who aim to convince the industry’s critics that new recycling technologies will make a difference. And one Hamburg-based chemist and inventor has suggestions for how we could solve the world’s plastics problem once and for all.

Is the plastics industry listening? Can people trust it to take responsibility for plastic products after the end of their life cycle? And what solutions are there in a world that is increasingly choking on plastic?

ABSTRACT
As humans, we manage the most complex system in the world: our bodies. As engineers and technicians, we have been building and operating some of the most complex systems on Earth and beyond for centuries. However, when we encounter modern cloud applications that serve us in our daily lives, we often find ourselves complaining that they are complicated. We label the communication lines in distributed systems as complex.

Why is that? Are we losing our ingenuity in dealing with modern applications?

This talk will explore the complexities of modern systems and help you understand the various types of complexity, both beneficial and detrimental. It will also provide strategies for effectively managing complexity while building cloud and serverless applications. By learning how to embrace complexity, you will be better equipped to grow your business beyond barriers! [...]

The film was shot extensively using modified iPhones, and Anthony shares his early conversations with director Danny Boyle about the film's intended rural setting that informed their decision to commit to using the devices. Anthony later explains how he jailbroke the iPhone's camera system with the help of tech advisors and employees at Apple, and we discuss how the limitations of the phone forced Anthony to adjust the amount of light he used while filming. We also learn how the bar cam system actually works, and Anthony details the type of VFX work done throughout the film. We later investigate why the sequel was shot with an Alexa, and Anthony describes the elaborate build of the Bone Temple location featured prominently in both films.Recommended Viewing: 28 YEARS LATERThis episode is sponsored by Sandstorm & Aputure]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From the archive: Who owns Einstein?

Kennedy Jr., the scion of a storied dynasty, endured tragedy and scandal, broke with the Democratic Party and his family, stoked conspiracy theories, and is reshaping government and public health.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

“The Rise of RFK Jr.”offers a powerful portrait of how President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services became who he is today — starting with his childhood in the public eye as a nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy.

The two-hour documentary draws on rich archival footage and two dozen interviews that include Kennedy’s lifelong friends, his cousin, top political advisors, close allies in the anti-vaccine movement, scientists he has clashed with, and some he has pushed out of the government. The film is a revelatory examination of Kennedy’s life — his darkest moments, his triumphs, and the influence he’s now exerting as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.

“If he continues in the current approach, it will make decisions to get vaccinated more difficult. As you see an erosion of people’s trust, you’ll see the numbers of people getting vaccinated going down, and you’ll start to see the numbers of illnesses coming back up,” says Dr. Daniel Jernigan, one of several top CDC officials who resigned under Kennedy and speaks out in the film. “And that’s an awful thing to think about in a country that has put so much into protecting Americans with vaccines so far.”

But Kennedy’s die-hard supporters, especially from the anti-vaccine movement, insist he is bringing welcome changes to America’s health system.  

“He’s trying to triage the worst health situation this country has ever found itself in,” says Del Bigtree, a podcaster, vaccine critic and a close friend of Kennedy. “You don’t have time to have disagreement around you. Get someone in here who agrees with where we’re going, and let’s do this.” 

Timely and gripping, “The Rise of RFK Jr.” is a must-watch documentary on one of the most prominent and controversial people in U.S. politics right now, and his impact on the country. 

“The Rise of RFK Jr.” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser, Vanessa Fica and Elliott Choi. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

The piece, published on Clark’s personal blog, is full of tortured analogies and self-serving sci-fi speculation about the future of AI, but essentially boils down to Clark saying he thinks artificial general intelligence is possible, extremely powerful, potentially dangerous, and scary to the general population. In order to prevent disaster, put the appropriate policies in place, and make people embrace AI positively, he said, AI companies should be transparent about what they are building and listen to people’s concerns.“What we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine,” he wrote. “And like all the best fairytales, the creature is of our own creation. Only by acknowledging it as being real and by mastering our own fears do we even have a chance to understand it, make peace with it, and figure out a way to tame it and live together.”Venture capitalist, podcaster, and the White House’s “AI and Crypto Czar” David Sacks was not a fan of Clark’s blog. “Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” Sacks  in response to Clark’s blog. “It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.”Things escalated yesterday when Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn’s co-founder and a megadonor to the Democratic party, supported Anthropic in a , saying “Anthropic was one of the good guys” because it's one of the companies “trying to deploy AI the right way, thoughtfully, safely, and enormously beneficial for society.” Hoffman also appeared to take a jab at Elon Musk’s xAI, saying “Some other labs are making decisions that clearly disregard safety and societal impact (e.g. bots that sometimes go full-fascist) and that’s a choice. So is choosing not to support them.”Sacks responded to Hoffman on X,  “The leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump wants you to know that ‘Anthropic is one of the good guys.’ Thanks for clarifying that. All we needed to know.” Musk hopped into the replies saying: “Indeed.”“The real issue is not research but rather Anthropic’s agenda to backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California,” . Here, Sacks is referring to Anthropic’s opposition to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which wanted to stop states from regulating AI in any way for 10 years, and its backing of California’s SB 53, which requires AI companies that generate more than $500 million in annual revenue to make their safety protocols public. All this sniping leads us to Amodei’s statement today, which doesn’t mention the beef above but is clearly designed to calm investors who are watching Trump’s AI guy publicly saying one of the biggest AI companies in the world sucks. “I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,” Amodei said. “Despite our track record of communicating frequently and transparently about our positions, there has been a recent uptick in inaccurate claims about Anthropic's policy stances. Some are significant enough that they warrant setting the record straight.”Amodei then goes to count the ways in which Anthropic already works with the federal government and directly grovels to Trump.“Anthropic  President Trump’s AI Action Plan. We have been supportive of the President’s efforts to expand energy provision in the US in order to win the AI race, and I  an AI and energy summit in Pennsylvania with President Trump, where he and I had a good conversation about US leadership in AI,” he said. “Anthropic’s Chief Product Officer attended a White House event where we  to accelerate healthcare applications of AI, and our Head of External Affairs attended the White House’s AI Education Taskforce event to support their efforts to advance AI fluency for teachers.”The more substantive part of his argument is that Anthropic didn’t support SB 53 until it made an exemption for all but the biggest AI labs, and that  found that Anthropic’s AI models are not “uniquely politically biased,” (read: not woke).“Again, we believe we share those goals with the Trump administration, both sides of Congress, ,” Amodei wrote. “We are going to keep being honest and straightforward, and will stand up for the policies we believe are right. The stakes of this technology are too great for us to do otherwise.”Many of the AI industry’s most vocal critics would agree with Sacks that Clark’s blog and “fear-mongering” about AI is self-serving because it makes their companies seem more valuable and powerful. Some critics will also agree that AI companies take advantage of that perspective to then influence AI regulation in a way that benefits them as incumbents. It would be a far more compelling argument if it didn’t come from Sacks and Musk, who found a much better way to influence AI regulation to benefit their companies and investments: working for the president directly and publicly bullying their competitors. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real-time Audio Deepfakes Have Arrived</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/real-time-audio-deepfake-vishing</link><author>Matthew S.

Several yachts were so badly damaged that they sank. But what’s behind the animals’ behavior?

Orcas, also known as killer whales, compete with fishers around the globe for tuna. Until five years ago, there had never been any reports of attacks on boats. But since then, there have been repeated reports of the creatures ramming yachts, particularly in summer and spring. The orcas mostly target the rudders of the sailboats. The main focal point of the "interactions,” as marine biologists refer to them, occur in the Strait of Gibraltar and off Portugal’s Atlantic Coast. Fishers, residents, whale watchers and researchers are puzzled by their sudden aggressive behavior. 
Various theories have been put forward. Some think it might be linked to competition over tuna, which migrate from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to spawn in May before returning in July. Others suspect that it is some kind of revenge action for past injuries incurred. An older female, the leader of an orca pod, allegedly had bad experiences with boats and is teaching pod members to fight back. Many marine biologists believe it is just a kind of game. What is certain is that no one has actually been seriously hurt up to now — not even on the yachts that sank, which begs the question: Are humans even the main target?

But OpenAI is following a trend we’ve known about for years: There are endless theorized applications of AI, but in the real world many people want to use LLMs for sexual gratification, and it’s up for the market to keep up. , a16z published an analysis of the generative AI market, which amounted to one glaringly obvious finding: people use AI as part of their sex lives. As Emanuel wrote at the time in his analysis of the analysis: “Even if we put ethical questions aside, it is absurd that a tech industry kingmaker like a16z can look at this data, write a blog titled ‘How Are Consumers Using Generative AI?’ and not come to the obvious conclusion that people are using it to jerk off. If you are actually interested in the generative AI boom and you are not identifying porn as a core use for the technology, you are either not paying attention or intentionally pretending it’s not happening.” Altman even hinting at introducing erotic roleplay as a feature is huge, because it’s a signal that he’s no longer pretending. People have been fucking the chatbot for a long time in an unofficial capacity, and have recently started hitting guardrails that stop them from doing so. People use Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, Elon Musk’s Grok, and self-rolled large language models to roleplay erotic scenarios whether the terms of use for those platforms permit it or not, DIYing AI boyfriends out of platforms that otherwise forbid it. And there are specialized erotic chatbot platforms and AI dating simulators, but what OpenAI does—as the owner of the biggest share of the chatbot market—the rest follow. Already we see other AI companies stroking their chins about it. Following Altman’s announcement, Amanda Askell, who works on the philosophical issues that arise with Anthropic’s alignment, posted: “It's unfortunate that people often conflate AI erotica and AI romantic relationships, given that one of them is clearly more concerning than the other. Of the two, I'm more worried about romantic relationships. Mostly because it seems like it would make users pretty vulnerable to the AI company in many ways. It seems like a hard area to navigate responsibly.” And the highly influential anti-porn crowd is paying attention, too: the National Center on Sexual Exploitation  following Altman’s post declaring that actually, no one should be allowed to do erotic roleplay with chatbots, not even adults. (Ron DeHaas, co-founder of Christian porn surveillance company Covenant Eyes, resigned from the NCOSE board earlier this month after his 38-year-old adult stepson was charged with felony child sexual abuse.)In the August interview, Abram sets up a question for Altman by noting that there’s a difference between “winning the race” and “building the AI future that would be best for the most people,” noting that it must be easier to focus on winning. She asks Altman for an example of a decision he’s had to make that would be best for the world but not best for winning. Altman responded that he’s proud of the impression users have that ChatGPT is “trying to help you,” and says a bunch of other stuff that’s not really answering the question, about alignment with users and so on. But then he started to say something actually interesting: “There's a lot of things we could do that would like, grow faster, that would get more time in ChatGPT, that we don't do because we know that like, our long-term incentive is to stay as aligned with our users as possible. But there's a lot of short-term stuff we could do that would really juice growth or revenue or whatever, and be very misaligned with that long-term goal,” Altman said. “And I'm proud of the company and how little we get distracted by that. But sometimes we do get tempted.”“Are there specific examples that come to mind?” Abram asked. “Any decisions that you've made?”After a full five-second pause to think, Altman said, “Well, we haven't put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet.” “That does seem like it would get time spent,” Abram replied. “Apparently, it does.” Altman said. They have a giggle about it and move on.Two months later, Altman was surprised that the erotica announcement blew up. “Without being paternalistic we will attempt to help users achieve their long-term goals,” . “But we are not the elected moral police of the world. In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here.” This announcement, aside from being a blatant hail mary cash grab for a company that’s bleeding funds because it’s already too popular, has inspired even more “bubble’s popping” speculation, something boosters and doomers alike have been saying (or rooting for) for months now. Once lauded as a productivity godsend, AI has mostly proven to be a hindrance to workers. It’s interesting that OpenAI’s embrace of erotica would cause that reaction, and not, say, the fact that AI is  and , , and . It’s also interesting that OpenAI, which takes user conversations as training data—along with all of the writing and information available on the internet—feels it’s finally gobbled enough training data from humans to be able to stoop so low, as Altman’s attitude insinuates, to let users be horny. That training data includes authors of romance novels and NSFW fanfic but also sex workers who’ve spent the last 10 years posting endlessly to social media platforms like Twitter (pre-X, when Elon Musk cut off OpenAI’s access) and , only to have their posts scraped into the training maw.Altman believes “sex bots” are not in service of the theoretical future that would “benefit the most people,” that it’s a fast-track to juicing revenue, something the company badly needs. People have always used technology for horny ends, and OpenAI might be among the last to realize that—or the first of the AI giants to actually admit it. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Etzel Cardeña - Can Psychic Phenomena Affect Consciousness Theories?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2gfwKbRps</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vq2gfwKbRps?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:01:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more videos on this topic here: https://shorturl.at/veaQ0

If psi phenomena are real and without explanation in physics – telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis – what would that suggest about the nature of consciousness, and which theories would be more consistent? We do not address whether or not psi phenomena are real, other than calling for critical thinking.

--

Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia for over three decades, used strategic dalliances, military might, and cutting-edge philosophy to modernize, expand, and transform the Russian Empire. But was she a dedicated ruler determined to move Russia into the future, or a ruthless monarch who oppressed anyone who questioned her? Carolyn Harris puts this controversial figure on trial.

DESCRIPTION
Liz and Lesley explore the evolution of platform engineering from its DevOps and SRE roots. They discuss the challenges of building effective developer platforms, the importance of psychological safety and evidence-based prioritization, the complexities of open source sustainability, and the delicate balance between centralized platform teams and developer autonomy.

The conversation covers practical insights on documentation automation, onboarding strategies, the manager-engineer career pendulum, and why treating platform work as a service rather than a mandate is crucial for organizational success.

She was given a Lithuanian name and forbidden from speaking German.

The end of World War Two changed not only the borders, but also countless lives—like Luise’s. She was one of hundreds of what now referred to as 'wolf children,' who fought to survive without their parents, all alone in East Prussia and the Baltics. The mass exodus from East Prussia deeply affected children. In northern East Prussia, around Königsberg, tens of thousands of people died from disease and malnutrition. Often, the children were left behind. But without their parents, any relatives, or homes, they were had to fend for themselves. Many fled from impending starvation by crossing into neighboring Lithuania, where they begged or worked for bread and other bare necessities. For decades, their stories went unrecognized. They were too young to be considered directly complicit, but just German enough to be blamed for the crimes of the Nazi regime.

He wanted to meet with someone who actually fabricates the neon and he couldn’t find anyone who physically does it,” Alvarado said. “He told me ‘You’re still doing the lost art.’ It came to my head that neon has been dying, there’s less and less people who have been learning. So I made this piece.” For 37 years, Alvarado has been practicing “the lost and found art” of neon sign bending, weathering the general ups and downs of business as well as, most threateningly, the rise of cheap LED signs that mimic neon and have become popular over the last few years. “When neon crashed and LED and the big letters like McDonald’s, all these big signs—they took neon before. Now it’s LED,” he said. In the last few years, though, he said there has been a resurgent interest in neon from artists and people who are rejecting the cheap feel of LED. “It came back more like, artistic, for art. So I’ve been doing 100 percent neon since then.” At his shop, Quality Neon Signs in Mid-City Los Angeles, there are signs in all sorts of states of completion and functionality strewn about Alvarado’s shop: old, mass-produced beer advertisements whose transformers have blown and are waiting for him to repair them, signs in the shapes of soccer and baseball jerseys, signs with inspirational phrases (“Everything is going to be fucking amazing,” “NEED MONEY FOR FAKE ART”), signs for restaurants, demonstration tubes that show the different colors he offers, weed shop signs, projects he made when he was bored. There are projects that are particularly meaningful to him: a silhouette he made of his wife holding their infant daughter, and a sign of the Los Angeles skyline with a wildfire burning in the background, “just to represent Los Angeles,” he said. There are old little bits of tube that have broken off of other pieces. “We save everything,” Alvarado said, “in case we want to fix it or need it for a repair.” His workshop, a few minutes away, features a “Home Sweet Home” sign,” a sign he made years ago for Twitter/Chanel collaboration featuring the old Twitter bird logo, and a sign for the defunct Channing Tatum buddy cop show . The overwhelming majority of signs Alvarado sells are traditional neon glass. The real thing. But he does offer newer LED faux-neon signs to clients who want it, though he doesn’t make those in-house. Alvarado says he sells LED to keep up with the times and because they can be more practical for one-off events because they are less likely to break in transit, but it’s clear that he and the overwhelming majority of neon sign makers think the LED stuff is simply not the same. Most LED signs look cheaper and do not emit the same warmth of light, but are more energy efficient.I asked two neon sign creators about the difference while I was shopping for signs. They said they think the environmental debate isn’t quite as straightforward as it seems because a lot of the LED signs they make seem to be for one-off events, meaning many LED signs are manufactured essentially for a single use and then turned into e-waste. Many real neon signs are bought as either artwork or are bought by businesses who are interested in the real aesthetic. And because they are generally more expensive and are handmade, they are used for years and can be repaired indefinitely.I asked Alvarado to show me the process and make a neon sign for 404 Media, which I’ve wanted for years. It’s a visceral, loud, scientific process, with gas-powered burners that sound like jet engines heating up the glass tubes to roughly 1,000 degrees so they can be bent into the desired shapes. When he first started bending neon, Alvarado says he used to use an overheard projector and a transparency to project a schematic onto the wall. These days, he mocks up designs on a computer aided design program and prints them out on a huge printer that uses a sharpie to draw the schematic. He then painstakingly marks out his planned glass bends on the paper, lining up the tubes with the mockup as he works.“You burn yourself a lot, your hands get burnt. You’re dealing with fire all the time,” Alvarado said. He burned himself several times while working on my piece. “For me it’s normal. Even if you’re a pro, you still burn yourself.” Every now and then, even for someone who has been doing this for decades, the glass tubes shatter: “You just gotta get another stick and do it again,” he said. After bending the glass and connecting the electrodes to one end of the piece, he connects the tubes to a high-powered vacuum that sucks the air out of them. The color of the light in Alvarado’s work is determined by a powdered coating within the tubes or a different colored coating of the tubes themselves; the type of gas and electrical current also changes the type and intensity of the colors. He uses neon for bright oranges and reds, and argon for cooler hues. Alvarado, of course, isn’t the only one still practicing the “lost art” of neon bending, but he’s one of just a few commercial businesses in Los Angeles still manufacturing and repairing neon signs for largely commercial customers. Another, called Signmakers, has made several large neon signs that have become iconic for people who live in Los Angeles. The artist Lili Lakich has maintained a well-known studio in Los Angeles’ Arts District for years and has taught “The Neon Workshop” to new students since 1982, and the Museum of Neon Art is in Glendale, just a few miles away. A few days after he made my neon sign, I was wandering around Los Angeles and came across an art gallery displaying Tory DiPietro’s neon work, which is largely fine art and pieces where neon is incorporated to other artworks; a neon “FRAGILE” superimposed on a globe, for example. Both DiPietro and Alvarado told me that there are still a handful of people practicing the lost art, and that in recent years there’s been a bit of a resurgent interest in neon, though it’s not that easy to learn.On the day I picked up my sign, there were two bright green “Meme House” signs for a memecoin investor house in Los Angeles that Alvarado said he had bent and made immediately after working on the 404 Media sign. “I was there working til about 11 p.m.” he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why The Germans PREFERRED SPITFIRES! 🤯</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/243BHAO4_VI</link><author>WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/243BHAO4_VI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:41:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSGFY2a_DYK8plQI_fcY_Xg">Podcast - WW2 Pod</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#WW2 #battleofbritain #WWII #luftwaffe #militaryhistory

Over the years I've cobbled together aliases and bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways I couldn't manage with simple scripts.One example is the op log, which lets you go to any point in your repo's time and provides simple undo and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn't mean to rebase, etc.Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the VCS. There's some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and there's one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of a GUI around how JJ works.Right now, [name-redacted] is an MVP in an open beta. I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though there's many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from the Beta.I'm really grateful for the great community JJ has built, alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I've read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar to many of the great products that are out there for git.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/10/20/seven-kubernetes-pitfalls-and-how-to-avoid/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s no secret that Kubernetes can be both powerful and frustrating at times. When I first started dabbling with container orchestration, I made more than my fair share of mistakes enough to compile a whole list of pitfalls. In this post, I want to walk through seven big gotchas I’ve encountered (or seen others run into) and share some tips on how to avoid them. Whether you’re just kicking the tires on Kubernetes or already managing production clusters, I hope these insights help you steer clear of a little extra stress.1. Skipping resource requests and limits: Not specifying CPU and memory requirements in Pod specifications. This typically happens because Kubernetes does not require these fields, and workloads can often start and run without them—making the omission easy to overlook in early configurations or during rapid deployment cycles.:
In Kubernetes, resource requests and limits are critical for efficient cluster management. Resource requests ensure that the scheduler reserves the appropriate amount of CPU and memory for each pod, guaranteeing that it has the necessary resources to operate. Resource limits cap the amount of CPU and memory a pod can use, preventing any single pod from consuming excessive resources and potentially starving other pods.
When resource requests and limits are not set:Resource Starvation: Pods may get insufficient resources, leading to degraded performance or failures. This is because Kubernetes schedules pods based on these requests. Without them, the scheduler might place too many pods on a single node, leading to resource contention and performance bottlenecks.Resource Hoarding: Conversely, without limits, a pod might consume more than its fair share of resources, impacting the performance and stability of other pods on the same node. This can lead to issues such as other pods getting evicted or killed by the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer due to lack of available memory.Start with modest  (for example  CPU,  memory) and see how your app behaves.Monitor real-world usage and refine your values; the HorizontalPodAutoscaler can help automate scaling based on metrics.Keep an eye on  or your logging/monitoring tool to confirm you’re not over- or under-provisioning.: Early on, I never thought about memory limits. Things seemed fine on my local cluster. Then, on a larger environment, Pods got  left and right. Lesson learned.
For detailed instructions on configuring resource requests and limits for your containers, please refer to Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods
(part of the official Kubernetes documentation).2. Underestimating liveness and readiness probes: Deploying containers without explicitly defining how Kubernetes should check their health or readiness. This tends to happen because Kubernetes will consider a container “running” as long as the process inside hasn’t exited. Without additional signals, Kubernetes assumes the workload is functioning—even if the application inside is unresponsive, initializing, or stuck.:
Liveness, readiness, and startup probes are mechanisms Kubernetes uses to monitor container health and availability. determine if the application is still alive. If a liveness check fails, the container is restarted. control whether a container is ready to serve traffic. Until the readiness probe passes, the container is removed from Service endpoints. help distinguish between long startup times and actual failures.Add a simple HTTP  to check a health endpoint (for example ) so Kubernetes can restart a hung container.Use a  to ensure traffic doesn’t reach your app until it’s warmed up.Keep probes simple. Overly complex checks can create false alarms and unnecessary restarts.: I once forgot a readiness probe for a web service that took a while to load. Users hit it prematurely, got weird timeouts, and I spent hours scratching my head. A 3-line readiness probe would have saved the day.3. “We’ll just look at container logs” (famous last words): Relying solely on container logs retrieved via . This often happens because the command is quick and convenient, and in many setups, logs appear accessible during development or early troubleshooting. However,  only retrieves logs from currently running or recently terminated containers, and those logs are stored on the node’s local disk. As soon as the container is deleted, evicted, or the node is restarted, the log files may be rotated out or permanently lost. using CNCF tools like Fluentd or Fluent Bit to aggregate output from all Pods. for a unified view of logs, metrics, and (if needed) traces. This lets you spot correlations between infrastructure events and app-level behavior.Pair logs with Prometheus metrics to track cluster-level data alongside application logs. If you need distributed tracing, consider CNCF projects like Jaeger.: The first time I lost Pod logs to a quick restart, I realized how flimsy “kubectl logs” can be on its own. Since then, I’ve set up a proper pipeline for every cluster to avoid missing vital clues.4. Treating dev and prod exactly the same: Deploying the same Kubernetes manifests with identical settings across development, staging, and production environments. This often occurs when teams aim for consistency and reuse, but overlook that environment-specific factors—such as traffic patterns, resource availability, scaling needs, or access control—can differ significantly. Without customization, configurations optimized for one environment may cause instability, poor performance, or security gaps in another.Use environment overlays or kustomize to maintain a shared base while customizing resource requests, replicas, or config for each environment.Extract environment-specific configuration into ConfigMaps and / or Secrets. You can use a specialized tool such as Sealed Secrets to manage confidential data.Plan for scale in production. Your dev cluster can probably get away with minimal CPU/memory, but prod might need significantly more.: One time, I scaled up  from 2 to 10 in a tiny dev environment just to “test.” I promptly ran out of resources and spent half a day cleaning up the aftermath. Oops.5. Leaving old stuff floating around: Leaving unused or outdated resources—such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, or PersistentVolumeClaims—running in the cluster. This often happens because Kubernetes does not automatically remove resources unless explicitly instructed, and there is no built-in mechanism to track ownership or expiration. Over time, these forgotten objects can accumulate, consuming cluster resources, increasing cloud costs, and creating operational confusion, especially when stale Services or LoadBalancers continue to route traffic. with a purpose or owner label. That way, you can easily query resources you no longer need. your cluster: run kubectl get all -n <namespace> to see what’s actually running, and confirm it’s all legit.Adopt Kubernetes’ Garbage Collection: K8s docs show how to remove dependent objects automatically.Leverage policy automation: Tools like Kyverno can automatically delete or block stale resources after a certain period, or enforce lifecycle policies so you don’t have to remember every single cleanup step.: After a hackathon, I forgot to tear down a “test-svc” pinned to an external load balancer. Three weeks later, I realized I’d been paying for that load balancer the entire time. Facepalm.6. Diving too deep into networking too soon: Introducing advanced networking solutions—such as service meshes, custom CNI plugins, or multi-cluster communication—before fully understanding Kubernetes' native networking primitives. This commonly occurs when teams implement features like traffic routing, observability, or mTLS using external tools without first mastering how core Kubernetes networking works: including Pod-to-Pod communication, ClusterIP Services, DNS resolution, and basic ingress traffic handling. As a result, network-related issues become harder to troubleshoot, especially when overlays introduce additional abstractions and failure points.Start small: a Deployment, a Service, and a basic ingress controller such as one based on NGINX (e.g., Ingress-NGINX).Make sure you understand how traffic flows within the cluster, how service discovery works, and how DNS is configured.Only move to a full-blown mesh or advanced CNI features when you actually need them, complex networking adds overhead.: I tried Istio on a small internal app once, then spent more time debugging Istio itself than the actual app. Eventually, I stepped back, removed Istio, and everything worked fine.7. Going too light on security and RBAC: Deploying workloads with insecure configurations, such as running containers as the root user, using the  image tag, disabling security contexts, or assigning overly broad RBAC roles like . These practices persist because Kubernetes does not enforce strict security defaults out of the box, and the platform is designed to be flexible rather than opinionated. Without explicit security policies in place, clusters can remain exposed to risks like container escape, unauthorized privilege escalation, or accidental production changes due to unpinned images.Use RBAC to define roles and permissions within Kubernetes. While RBAC is the default and most widely supported authorization mechanism, Kubernetes also allows the use of alternative authorizers. For more advanced or external policy needs, consider solutions like OPA Gatekeeper (based on Rego), Kyverno, or custom webhooks using policy languages such as CEL or Cedar.Pin images to specific versions (no more !). This helps you know what’s actually deployed.Look into Pod Security Admission (or other solutions like Kyverno) to enforce non-root containers, read-only filesystems, etc.: I never had a huge security breach, but I’ve heard plenty of cautionary tales. If you don’t tighten things up, it’s only a matter of time before something goes wrong.Kubernetes is amazing, but it’s not psychic, it won’t magically do the right thing if you don’t tell it what you need. By keeping these pitfalls in mind, you’ll avoid a lot of headaches and wasted time. Mistakes happen (trust me, I’ve made my share), but each one is a chance to learn more about how Kubernetes truly works under the hood.
If you’re curious to dive deeper, the official docs and the community Slack are excellent next steps. And of course, feel free to share your own horror stories or success tips, because at the end of the day, we’re all in this cloud native adventure together.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet Season 2 Trailer | Premieres Oct. 22</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bX8m44ueOGE</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bX8m44ueOGE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:28:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[COMING SOON: An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet captures Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's search for people across the globe who are helping drive humanity toward a brighter, more sustainable future.

DESCRIPTION
Principal Software Engineer Vanessa Formicola introduces the concept of "holistic engineering" – the practice of making technical decisions while factoring in non-technical forces that inevitably impact code and architecture. Through patterns like the "solo coding event", "everything but the kitchen sink" and "space abuse" she demonstrates how human behaviors, organizational dynamics, career frameworks, and company processes leave traces in codebases that no one intentionally designed.

Vanessa argues that technical leaders must look beyond pure technical excellence to understand the organic system they're working within, advocating for honest conversations about constraints and realistic architectural decisions that account for human factors.
The discussion extends to the emerging need for ethical engineering as our technical decisions increasingly impact society at unprecedented speed, with practical advice for teams to analyze their own systems through the lens of tech, people, and product dimensions.

This is the tragic story of Charles II, "The Bewitched," the last king of his line, whose very existence was a death sentence for an empire.

We dive deep into the science of his incredible inbreeding coefficient, revealing how centuries of cousin-on-cousin marriages concentrated disastrous recessive genes. Charles II was born with a level of consanguinity higher than that of a child born of a brother-sister union, leading to a host of debilitating conditions: the infamous Habsburg jaw that prevented him from chewing, a large tongue, developmental delays (he couldn't walk until age eight), and extreme frailty.

His physical state was so pitiable that courtiers genuinely believed he was possessed, leading to multiple failed exorcisms. But the true curse was biological. He was infertile and impotent, and his death at age 38, childless and suffering, didn't just end a man's life; it plunged Europe into the devastating War of the Spanish Succession.

That means climbing 3,000 meters in altitude, all while crossing rivers and a glacier. Called "transhumance,” the seasonal movement of livestock is now world cultural heritage.

Along with 1,400 sheep, shepherd Markus and his colleagues travel from South Tyrol to Austria every spring, journeying back again in the fall. Just like his ancestors, Markus looks after the animals on the mountain pastures throughout the summer. It’s an arduous task, but also a dream job.

Markus is also responsible for ensuring that the crossing of the Alps runs smoothly again this year. This is no easy feat, as the route over rockfall and ice is dangerous for animals and humans alike. Accidents happen again and again: "One slip and you're gone," he says. "But still, it's something very special. For me, it's an honor to be part of it."

Markus spends the summer alone on the mountain pasture, looking after healthy and sick sheep for months on end. A little further down, in the Schnalstal Valley, his brother Johann looks after the family farm and the animals that spend the summer there.

The two brothers are bucking a trend, as sheep farming is hardly financially viable anymore. There is little money to be made from the wool and meat of the animals. Shepherds and farmers increasingly need an additional source of income, or are changing their focus completely. 

Nonetheless, South Tyrolean sheep farmers are still hoping that this season will be better than the last, meaning one without injured sheep, and without accidents. It is important to them that the next generation will also have the opportunity to continue the tradition that has been going on for thousands of years.

He didn’t break out in Hollywood until his forties, and even then he refused to sell out.

Throughout the 80s and 90s he worked in smaller roles and smaller films. But then came The Lord of the Rings. Cast at the last minute as Aragorn, he threw himself into the role, breaking toes on camera, doing nearly all of his own stunts, and even carrying his sword everywhere he went. The trilogy made him a star, but that was never the point.

Instead of cashing in, he turned down other franchises and bigger projects, choosing riskier films instead like A HIstory of Violence, Eastern Promises and Captain Fantastic. He starved himself for The Road, stuffed himself with pizza for Green Book, and earned Oscar nominations along the way.

For him, fame was never the goal. Acting, painting, writing, and music were all just different ways to express himself, not ways to be seen.

This is the story of when an actor didn’t care about fame, and only focused on the work itself. This is Viggo Mortensen.

If we seek God, we cannot avoid the problem of evil. Can the enormity of evil ever be compatible with an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good God? Couldn’t God have created the world without such evil? A little evil, perhaps, so that there are consequences of acts, but the unrelenting, monumental evil in the world exceeds all decency. Did God have no choice?

I’ve recently open-sourced Pyversity, a lightweight library for diversifying retrieval results. Most retrieval systems optimize only for relevance, which can lead to top-k results that look almost identical. Pyversity efficiently re-ranks results to balance relevance and diversity, surfacing items that remain relevant but are less redundant. This helps with improving retrieval, recommendation, and RAG pipelines without adding latency or complexity.- Unified API: one function (diversify) supporting several well-known strategies: MMR, MSD, DPP, and COVER (with more to come)- Lightweight: the only dependency is NumPy, keeping the package small and easy to install- Fast: efficient implementations for all supported strategies; diversify results in millisecondsRe-ranking with cross-encoders is very popular right now, but also very expensive. From my experience, you can usually improve retrieval results with simpler and faster methods, such as the ones implemented in this package. This helps retrieval, recommendation, and RAG systems present richer, more informative results by ensuring each new item adds new information.Code and docs: github.com/pringled/pyversityLet me know if you have any feedback, or suggestions for other diversification strategies to support!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Today&apos;s Censorship Is Worse.</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyWrFOQlQEc</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qyWrFOQlQEc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 14:16:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thank you to all my new patrons (who I forgot to include in the credits): Hampus, Tyler, Paula, Dominic, Mo Tzu, and Maria!

He wants to drive what he sees as a "demon” out of the Kremlin. But Russian authorities have fought back.

In March 2019, Alexander Gabyshev set out on an 8,000-kilometer walk from Siberia to Moscow. His destination: the Kremlin. He planned to use traditional shamanic rites to drive out the "demon”: Russian President Vladimir Putin. But Alexander Gabyshev’s protest march quickly attracted attention, and he became too much for the authorities. He continued to protest despite several arrests, until finally, in January 2021, authorities stormed his house and took him away to a psychiatric hospital. An expert has classified him as mentally ill, but Amnesty International calls him a political prisoner. Lawyers are fighting to secure his release - so far without success.

What is the relationship between consciousness and the nature of ultimate reality? Some say there is no relationship; consciousness is a late, contingent product of biological evolution. Others say consciousness is irreducible and fundamental, whether part of ultimate reality or all of it. Does it make sense to explore consciousness and cosmos together?

Here are the studies this week that mounted a defense, felt out of place, found new life, and resurrected the gods of yore.First, a tale of pregnant stinkbugs, parasitic wasps, and fungi weapons that is fit for a rebooted Aesop fable. Then, a fast food stop for an errant black hole; a new cast of worms, mollusks, and “tusk-shells” from the deep sea; and a friendly reminder to REPENT, SINNERS, or suffer divine wrath.Painting eggs (with protective fungi)For years, scientists assumed that the weird lumps on the hindlegs of some female stinkbugs were used as auditory organs to perceive sound. A new study reveals that the function of these “tympanum” organs is, in fact, way weirder: They are miniature fungi farms that the “gravid” (pregnant) females use to culture “hyphae” (fungal filaments) to grow anti-wasp coatings for their eggs. “To address the question of the function of the tympanum, we investigated the Japanese dinidorid stinkbug  and discovered that this stinkbug’s hindleg organ is not auditory but a previously unknown type of symbiotic organ,” said researchers led by Takanori Nishino of the University of Tsukuba.  “We observed that the gravid females laid eggs in a row, and when each egg was deposited, the females rhythmically scratched the fungus-covered hindleg organ with the tarsal claws of the opposite hindleg and rubbed the egg surface, smearing the fungi onto the eggs,” the team said. “Within a few days, the fungal hyphae grew to cover the entire egg mass. On hatching, the hyphae attached to the body surface of newborn nymphs, although the fungi were subsequently lost as the nymphs molted and grew.”Don’t you just love the smell of fungus-covered eggs in the morning? Probably not, and that’s the point. Parasitic wasps like to go around ovipositing (laying their young) inside the eggs of other bugs, but the team discovered they were repeatedly thwarted by the stinkbug shield.“In the experimental arena, the female wasps approached both the fungus-removed eggs and the fungus-covered eggs,” the researchers said. “Immediately after antennal drumming on the egg surface, the female wasps only oviposited on the cleaned eggs… It is notable that wasps still approached egg masses fully covered by fungal hyphae, despite showing intense self-grooming, which suggested that the hyphae were adherent.”That’s what these wasps get for trying to mooch off stinkbug eggs: a faceful of sticky fungal goo that’s going to take some very intense self-grooming to remove. To that end, the team concluded that “the fungi selectively cultured on the female’s hindleg organ of are transferred to eggs to act as a physical defense against parasitic wasp attack.”  As the old adage goes, never judge a stinkbug by her conspicuous tympanal organs.Who left a supermassive black hole all the way over here?When stars wander too close to black holes, they are torn apart by extreme tidal forces, producing radiant light shows called tidal disruption events (TDEs). Astronomers have witnessed these events countless times near the central nucleus of distant galaxies, which are occupied by supermassive black holes, but a team has now captured an unprecedented glimpse of an “off-nuclear” TDE far from the galactic core. The event, called AT 2024tvd, involved a black hole with a possible mass of up to 10 million Suns. While it’s a pretty typical enormous black hole, what’s weird is that it was spotted eating a star about 2,600 light years from the nucleus of a distant galaxy, which produced the unusual TDE. Scientists have seen a few dim hints of these off-nuclear events, but this is the first to be clearly captured in bright radio waves.  “AT 2024tvd is the first radio-bright, bona fide off-nuclear TDE, and it is also the TDE with the fastest evolution observed to date,” said researchers led by Itai Sfaradi of the University of California, Berkeley.The team speculate that the black hole might have been gravitationally kicked into the galaxy after a dust-up with other, bigger black holes elsewhere. While that sounds like a tumultuous backstory, at least this black hole was able to grab a stellar bite along the way. Here be mollusks, worms, and chitonsMeet the newest invertebrates on the deep-ocean block in a study that identified 14 previously unknown species from remote marine regions around the world. These taxonomic newcomers include the carnivorous , the , and the aptly nicknamed “tusk shell” () “Despite centuries of exploration, marine invertebrate biodiversity remains notably under-described,” said researchers with theSenckenberg Ocean Species Alliance (SOSA), an international collaboration that was “founded to help meet this challenge.”While all of the newly identified species are fascinating, I have a selfish soft spot for  (no relation to me, or any of the two million Ferreiras in the world). This deep-sea chiton species belongs to a broader genus established by researcher A.J. Ferreira several decades ago. The new chiton was found in some sunken wood two miles under the sea and is described as having a “very large girdle” and “epibiotic tubeworms on its tail valves,” bringing extra pizazz to the family name.    Old-world solutions to new-world problemsHere’s an out-of-the-box idea to save the environment: Bring back vengeful gods and spirits. In a truly delightful study, scientists explore the benefits of perceived supernatural punishment on the preservation of natural ecosystems with mathematical game theory outlined in the following illustration:“Japanese folklore includes episodes where spirits of nature (e.g., mountains and trees) punish or avenge people who develop or overuse natural resources,” said researchers led by Shota Shibasaki of Doshisha University. “Similarly, the Batak people of Palawan Island in the Philippines believe in the forest spirits that punish people who overexploit or waste forest resources. Itzá Maya, Guatemala, also views forest spirits as punitively protecting local forests against exploitation.”  This is the most galaxy-brained math paper I’ve ever read. Ultimately, the results suggest that “supernatural beliefs could play an important role in achieving sustainability.” So let’s break out the talismans and start casting eco-friendly spells because I, for one, welcome our divine treehugging overlords.  Thanks for reading! See you next week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Checking in on the polar bear cam 🐻‍❄️ #BaysOfLife #NationalGeographic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/E9y-_9GiP7k</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/E9y-_9GiP7k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Discover the compelling story of Cree and Inuit communities fighting to protect their waters — the lifeblood of families for millenia.

Private equity has long promised smooth returns, operational excellence, and sophisticated diversification. But behind the pitch decks and performance charts lies a growing crisis. In this video, we explore:
🔹 Why private equity firms are struggling to exit investments
🔹 The illusion of stability created by stale pricing
🔹 The role of leverage in driving returns — and fragility
🔹 The push into 401(k)s and what it means for retail investors
🔹 The rise of continuation funds, NAV loans, and other liquidity maneuvers
🔹 The social and regulatory backlash against PE roll-up strategies
🔹 What Bain, Buffett, and Cliff Asness really think about the model
From inflated IRRs to collapsing portfolio companies, the cracks are starting to show. Is private equity still a smart bet — or just a sophisticated shell game?

This article reflects its work, accomplishments, and insights into how a working group operates.)In the complex world of Kubernetes, policies play a crucial role in managing and securing clusters. But have you ever wondered how these policies are developed, implemented, and standardized across the Kubernetes ecosystem? To answer that, let's take a look back at the work of the Policy Working Group.The Policy Working Group was dedicated to a critical mission: providing an overall architecture that encompasses both current policy-related implementations and future policy proposals in Kubernetes. Their goal was both ambitious and essential: to develop a universal policy architecture that benefits developers and end-users alike.Through collaborative methods, this working group strove to bring clarity and consistency to the often complex world of Kubernetes policies. By focusing on both existing implementations and future proposals, they ensured that the policy landscape in Kubernetes remains coherent and accessible as the technology evolves.This blog post dives deeper into the work of the Policy Working Group, guided by insights from its former co-chairs:These co-chairs explained what the Policy Working Group was all about.Hello, thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes?: My name is Jim Bugwadia, and I am a co-founder and the CEO at Nirmata which provides solutions that automate security and compliance for cloud-native workloads. At Nirmata, we have been working with Kubernetes since it started in 2014. We initially built a Kubernetes policy engine in our commercial platform and later donated it to CNCF as the Kyverno project. I joined the CNCF Kubernetes Policy Working Group to help build and standardize various aspects of policy management for Kubernetes and later became a co-chair.: My name is Andy Suderman and I am the CTO of Fairwinds, a managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service provider. I began working with Kubernetes in 2016 building a web conferencing platform. I am an author and/or maintainer of several Kubernetes-related open-source projects such as Goldilocks, Pluto, and Polaris. Polaris is a JSON-schema-based policy engine, which started Fairwinds' journey into the policy space and my involvement in the Policy Working Group.: My name is Poonam Lamba, and I currently work as a Product Manager for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) at Google. My journey with Kubernetes began back in 2017 when I was building an SRE platform for a large enterprise, using a private cloud built on Kubernetes. Intrigued by its potential to revolutionize the way we deployed and managed applications at the time, I dove headfirst into learning everything I could about it. Since then, I've had the opportunity to build the policy and compliance products for GKE. I lead and contribute to GKE CIS benchmarks. I am involved with the Gatekeeper project as well as I have contributed to Policy-WG for over 2 years and served as a co-chair for the group.Responses to the following questions represent an amalgamation of insights from the former co-chairs.One thing even I am not aware of is the difference between a working group and a SIG. Can you help us understand what a working group is and how it is different from a SIG?Unlike SIGs, working groups are temporary and focused on tackling specific, cross-cutting issues or projects that may involve multiple SIGs. Their lifespan is defined, and they disband once they've achieved their objective. Generally, working groups don't own code or have long-term responsibility for managing a particular area of the Kubernetes project.You mentioned that Working Groups involve multiple SIGS. What SIGS was the Policy WG closely involved with, and how did you coordinate with them?The group collaborated closely with Kubernetes SIG Auth throughout our existence, and more recently, the group also worked with SIG Security since its formation. Our collaboration occurred in a few ways. We provided periodic updates during the SIG meetings to keep them informed of our progress and activities. Additionally, we utilize other community forums to maintain open lines of communication and ensured our work aligned with the broader Kubernetes ecosystem. This collaborative approach helped the group stay coordinated with related efforts across the Kubernetes community.Why was the Policy Working Group created?To enable a broad set of use cases, we recognize that Kubernetes is powered by a highly declarative, fine-grained, and extensible configuration management system. We've observed that a Kubernetes configuration manifest may have different portions that are important to various stakeholders. For example, some parts may be crucial for developers, while others might be of particular interest to security teams or address operational concerns. Given this complexity, we believe that policies governing the usage of these intricate configurations are essential for success with Kubernetes.Our Policy Working Group was created specifically to research the standardization of policy definitions and related artifacts. We saw a need to bring consistency and clarity to how policies are defined and implemented across the Kubernetes ecosystem, given the diverse requirements and stakeholders involved in Kubernetes deployments.Can you give me an idea of the work you did in the group?We worked on several Kubernetes policy-related projects. Our initiatives included:We worked on a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) for the Kubernetes Policy Reports API. This aims to standardize how policy reports are generated and consumed within the Kubernetes ecosystem.We conducted a CNCF survey to better understand policy usage in the Kubernetes space. This helped gauge the practices and needs across the community at the time.We wrote a paper that will guide users in achieving PCI-DSS compliance for containers. This is intended to help organizations meet important security standards in their Kubernetes environments.We also worked on a paper highlighting how shifting security down can benefit organizations. This focuses on the advantages of implementing security measures earlier in the development and deployment process.Can you tell us what were the main objectives of the Policy Working Group and some of your key accomplishments?The charter of the Policy WG was to help standardize policy management for Kubernetes and educate the community on best practices.To accomplish this we updated the Kubernetes documentation (Policies | Kubernetes), produced several whitepapers (Kubernetes Policy Management, Kubernetes GRC), and created the Policy Reports API (API reference) which standardizes reporting across various tools. Several popular tools such as Falco, Trivy, Kyverno, kube-bench, and others support the Policy Report API. A major milestone for the Policy WG was promoting the Policy Reports API to a SIG-level API or finding it a stable home.Beyond that, as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and MutatingAdmissionPolicy approached GA in Kubernetes, a key goal of the WG was to guide and educate the community on the tradeoffs and appropriate usage patterns for these built-in API objects and other CNCF policy management solutions like OPA/Gatekeeper and Kyverno.What were some of the major challenges that the Policy Working Group worked on?During our work in the Policy Working Group, we encountered several challenges:One of the main issues we faced was finding time to consistently contribute. Given that many of us have other professional commitments, it can be difficult to dedicate regular time to the working group's initiatives.Another challenge we experienced was related to our consensus-driven model. While this approach ensures that all voices are heard, it can sometimes lead to slower decision-making processes. We valued thorough discussion and agreement, but this can occasionally delay progress on our projects.We've also encountered occasional differences of opinion among group members. These situations require careful navigation to ensure that we maintain a collaborative and productive environment while addressing diverse viewpoints.Lastly, we've noticed that newcomers to the group may find it difficult to contribute effectively without consistent attendance at our meetings. The complex nature of our work often requires ongoing context, which can be challenging for those who aren't able to participate regularly.Can you tell me more about those challenges? How did you discover each one? What has the impact been? What were some strategies you used to address them?There are no easy answers, but having more contributors and maintainers greatly helps! Overall the CNCF community is great to work with and is very welcoming to beginners. So, if folks out there are hesitating to get involved, I highly encourage them to attend a WG or SIG meeting and just listen in.It often takes a few meetings to fully understand the discussions, so don't feel discouraged if you don't grasp everything right away. We made a point to emphasize this and encouraged new members to review documentation as a starting point for getting involved.Additionally, differences of opinion were valued and encouraged within the Policy-WG. We adhered to the CNCF core values and resolve disagreements by maintaining respect for one another. We also strove to timebox our decisions and assign clear responsibilities to keep things moving forward.This is where our discussion about the Policy Working Group ends. The working group, and especially the people who took part in this article, hope this gave you some insights into the group's aims and workings.

disclaimer (updated May 2025): voidzilla is an opinion‑driven channel that comments on the news of the day under the satirical and rhetorically hyperbolic banner “CRIME IS LEGAL.” the phrase critiques what we see as a lax or uneven regulatory enforcement environment for fraud. unlike our affiliated channel Coffeezilla, which conducts detailed investigations and source‑document deep dives, and draws opinions from that, voidzilla offers rapid‑fire commentary and criticism on information already in the public domain. statements here reflect the host’s views at the moment of recording and may become outdated as facts evolve. references to “crime,” “fraud,” “scam,” or similar terms appear in a rhetorical hyperbolic context similar to “CRIME IS LEGAL.” unless we expressly state that a court has entered a final judgment, no segment should be read as a definitive finding of legal liability. viewers are urged to consult primary sources and form independent conclusions. production of this program is public‑interest commentary protected by the First Amendment and the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA).

And in agriculture, fungi pose a massive threat to harvests. And the available antidotes for humans and plants are increasingly losing their effectiveness.

Worldwide, fungal infections are already responsible for three times as many deaths as malaria. Experts are extremely concerned about infections caused by invasive fungi, as the numbers are rising rapidly. 

The focus is on two types of fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida auris. Both have been classified as particularly dangerous by the WHO. Since the discovery of Candida auris, there have been repeated life-threatening outbreaks worldwide, especially in hospitals. 

Up to 60 percent of infections are currently fatal. The fungus is spreading rapidly. So far, it has been detected in more than 50 countries. Molds such as Aspergillus fumigatus are also a cause for concern, as the fungi are now resistant to many drugs and disinfectants. 

The documentary shows what tulips, molds and pneumonia have to do with each other, and what role intensive agriculture and climate change play in the spread of fungal infections.

This week, we discuss crowdsourced resistance and a big government data dump.: I don’t want to say it’s that we publish positive stories. We post more of those than people probably even realize, because the gnarly stories are the ones that go viral, or are talked about by your friends or aggregated by other news outlets. A “scoop” is almost never a happy story because often they’re predicated on information someone in a position of power didn’t want the world to know. But it’s definitely less common for us to report on things that makes you feel good or hopeful than things that make you go “oh shit” or “Jesus fucking Christ,” I will admit. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blaise Agüera y Arcas: What Happens When AI Starts Evolving? | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZDlFt_jrA</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tkZDlFt_jrA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:01:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Make a donation to Closer To Truth to help us continue exploring the world's deepest questions without the need for paywalls: https://shorturl.at/OnyRq

What happens when artificial intelligence begins to evolve on its own? Blaise Agüera y Arcas, a leading researcher at Google DeepMind, explores the possibility of self-improving AI—systems that enhance their own capabilities without human input.

Host Robert Lawrence Kuhn asks about recent claims from Meta researchers who say their AI models are learning autonomously, as well as new theoretical frameworks for recursive self-improvement. Could these developments mark a turning point in the evolution of intelligence itself?

DESCRIPTION
Abby Bangser (Principal Engineer at Syntasso) speaks with Kief Morris (Distinguished Engineer at Thoughtworks consultant and Author of "Infrastructure as Code") about the evolution of infrastructure as code over the past decade. They discuss how the field has grown from simple server configuration management to complex cloud architectures, the challenges of current tooling, and emerging solutions like System Initiative.

The conversation explores the importance of abstraction layers, the application of software development principles to infrastructure, and how AI might transform the field. They emphasize that infrastructure decisions must align with business needs rather than being treated as generic plumbing, highlighting the ongoing need for platform engineering and developer experience considerations.

Featuring six full episodes:

African Werewolf
Reports are coming in from Tanzania that sound like they're straight out of a horror movie. The peace of the farmlands is being disturbed by the blood curdling screams of farmers being dragged off to their deaths by a huge violent creature. Locals say the beast is so murderous and cunning that it could be a human transformed into an animal. Not only that but they say the full moon is a sign of impending attack. Sounds like Richard is on the tail of an African Werewolf. 

Mekong Flesh-Eater
Across Thailand's rivers and waterways, a terrifying creature is attacking unsuspecting fisherman. Petrified locals report an aquatic giant that strikes in shallow water, gouging flesh and leaving victims with horrendous wounds and intense pain. Nat Geo WILD joins adventurer Richard Terry as he travels to the Mekong River in search of the mysterious creature. Victim interviews and investigation of the attack sites could hold the clues to the identity of this Mekong Flesh-Eater. 

Man-Eating Menace
From the remote swamps of eastern India, reports are coming in of villages full of widows -- their husbands killed by a creature that attacks unseen and unprovoked. The culprit is one of nature's most revered animals: the Bengal tiger. Normally, tigers shy away from people, but in this region thousands of innocent locals have died at the jaws of these cats, and it's only getting worse -- but why? Nat Geo joins adventurer Richard Terry as he investigates this pattern of strange animal behavior. 

Winged Assassin
Adventurer Richard Terry travels to a remote Indonesian island chain to investigate reports of a flying creature said to attack humans. Villagers say the monster has a huge wingspan and makes a terrifying sound before it attacks, swooping in on its victims in the forest and in villages. Determined to find out what animal is behind the attacks, Nat Geo WILD follows Terry on a journey that takes him from the rainforest canopy, along crocodile-infested rivers and into dark, damp caves.  

Amazon River Beast
Deep in the Brazilian Amazon, an unknown creature is responsible for a string of brutal attacks on villagers. The monster is said to strike ferociously and when least expected, and disappear into the jungle before it can be caught, leaving its victims with horrible wounds and terrified to enter the waters again. Nat Geo WILD joins adventurer Richard Terry on his quest to track down this Amazon River Beast.  

Brazilian Bigfoot
For generations, tales of a creature called the mapinguari have been passed down among Amazonian villagers. They describe a tall, shaggy beast that attacks with little warning, calling out with a deafening roar. In the world's largest rainforest, new species are discovered every few days, and after hearing stories from villagers who claim they came face to face with the creature, Richard Terry tries to determine whether the mapinguari is more than a myth.

Uncertainty driven by Donald Trump’s trade war as well as questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and America’s wavering economy have also played a part. Add to that heightened geopolitical tensions across the globe and you have a recipe for a mass flight to gold. And that’s exactly what central banks and investors have been doing. 

Now with China seeking to offer an alternative to American dominance, we look at what gold’s historic rise means for the global financial system.

More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets.Next-gen, DIY hosting that can’t be tampered withSince February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ars Live recap: Is the AI bubble about to pop?

In return you’ll get a whole extra Take 2 alongside Take 1 every week, with bonus reviews, more viewing recommendations from the Good Doctors and whole bonus episodes just for you. And if you’re already a Vanguardista, we salute you. 

Another packed show this week with four movie reviews for your listening pleasure. First up, ‘Black Phone 2’ -- the sequel to 2021’s comms-based chiller, starring Ethan Hawke. Like a lot of horror movies, the fact that his character died in the last film isn’t really a big deal. Speaking of reanimation, we’ve got Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein too—a fresh take on the much-adapted classic horror novel, this time starring Jacob Elordi as the monster. ‘Roofman’ sees Channing Tatum hiding in a Toys ‘R’ Us in a crime caper based on a bizarre true story from ‘The Place Beyond The Pines’ director Derek Cianfrance—and finally, a new Luca Guadagnino out this week too. ‘After The Hunt’ stars Julia Roberts as a Yale college professor frustrated by her student’s allegations against a colleague... and it’s ripe to get under Mark’s skin—so buckle up for that one. 

Plus, those of you who enjoyed Mark’s review of ‘Plainclothes’ last week will be pleased to hear that this week we’re welcoming the very lovely Russell Tovey to the show. The charged drama follows an undercover cop assigned to arrest gay men at cruising spots—and Russell plays a target who becomes an unexpected love interest. He and Simon unpack the film and how it speaks to today—plus a bit of art chat and a mysterious arty paperback too... 

Strap in too for what we think is an especially good Laughter Lift, if we do say so ourselves—and more of your top correspondence answered—including a fascinating neuroscientific take on tearjerkers.

Join us for an extraordinary escape story: 19-year-old Charles Hare's audacious journey through enemy territory in 1809, disguised as a French customs officer, under the constant threat of being shot as an enemy spy as he travelled secretly by road and river, terrified his cover would be blown, desperate to get home.

Now, for the very first time, the National Maritime Museum is displaying the uniform and Hare's first-hand account of his amazing exploits, and History Hit has exclusive access to the process.  The objects have been looked after by Hare's descendants for nearly 200 years, unknown to Napoleonic scholars until now.  Together with the research and conservation, these never-before-seen artefacts open up a whole new chapter of escape and adventure from a fascinating period of history.

The complaint asks a federal court to stop this unconstitutional surveillance program, which has silenced and frightened both citizens and noncitizens, and hampered the ability of the unions to associate with their members and potential members. The case is titled UAW v. State Department.Since taking power, the Trump administration has created a mass surveillance program to monitor constitutionally protected speech by noncitizens lawfully present in the U.S. Using AI and other automated technologies, the program surveils the social media accounts of visa holders with the goal of identifying and punishing those who express viewpoints the government doesn't like. This has been paired with a public intimidation campaign, silencing not just noncitizens with immigration status, but also the families, coworkers, and friends with whom their lives are integrated.As detailed in the complaint, when asked in a survey if they had changed their social media activity as a result of the Trump administration's ideological online surveillance program, over 60 percent of responding UAW members and over 30 percent of responding CWA members who were aware of the program said they had. Among noncitizens, these numbers were even higher. Of respondents aware of the program, over 80 percent of UAW members who were not U.S. citizens and over 40 percent of CWA members who were not U.S. citizens said they had changed their activity online.Individual union members reported refraining from posting, refraining from sharing union content, deleting posts, and deleting entire accounts in response to the ideological online surveillance program. Criticism of the Trump administration or its policies was the most common type of content respondents reported changing their social media activity around. Many members also reported altering their offline union activity in response to the program, including avoiding being publicly identified as part of the unions and reducing their participation in rallies and protests. One member even said they declined to report a wage theft claim due to fears arising from the surveillance program.Represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Muslim Advocates (MA), and the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic (MFIA), the UAW, CWA, and AFT seek to halt the program that affects thousands of their members individually and has harmed the ability of the unions to organize, represent, and recruit members. The lawsuit argues that the viewpoint-based online surveillance program violates the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act."The Trump administration's use of surveillance to track and intimidate UAW members is a direct assault on the First Amendment—and an attack on every working person in this country," said . "When they spy on, silence, and fire union members for speaking out, they're not just targeting individuals—they're targeting the very idea of freedom itself. The right to protest, to organize, to speak without fear—that's the foundation of American democracy. If they can come for UAW members at our worksites, they can come for any one of us tomorrow. And we will not stand by and let that happen.""Every worker should be alarmed by the Trump administration’s online surveillance program," said CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. "The labor movement is built on our freedoms under the First Amendment to speak and assemble without fear retaliation by the government. The unconstitutional Challenged Surveillance Program threatens those freedoms and explicitly targets those who are critical of the administration and its policies. This policy interferes with CWA members’ ability to express their points of view online and organize to improve their working conditions.""Free speech is the foundation of democracy in America," said AFT President Randi Weingarten. "The Trump administration has rejected that core constitutional right and now says only speech it agrees with is permitted—and that it will silence those who disagree. This suit exposes the online surveillance tools and other cyber tactics never envisioned by the founders to enforce compliance with the administration’s views. It details the direct harms on both the target of these attacks and the chilling effect on all those we represent and teach." "Using a variety of AI and automated tools, the government can now conduct viewpoint-based surveillance and analysis on a scale that was never possible with human review alone," said EFF Staff Attorney Lisa Femia. "The scale of this spying is matched by an equally massive chilling effect on free speech.""The administration is hunting online for an ever-growing list of disfavored viewpoints," said Golnaz Fakhimi, Legal Director of Muslim Advocates. "Its goal is clear: consolidate authoritarian power by crushing dissent, starting with noncitizens, but certainly not ending there. This urgent lawsuit aims to put a stop to this power grab and defend First Amendment freedoms crucial to a pluralistic and democratic society.""This case goes to the heart of the First Amendment," said , a student in the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic. "The government can’t go after people for saying things it doesn’t like. The current administration has ignored that principle, developing a vast surveillance apparatus to find and punish people for their constitutionally protected speech. It is an extraordinary abuse of power, creating a climate of fear not seen in this country since the McCarthy era, especially on college campuses. Our laws and Constitution will not allow it."https://www.eff.org/document/uaw-v-dos-complaintFor more about the litigation: https://eff.org/cases/united-auto-workers-v-us-department-stateElectronic Frontier Foundation: press@eff.orgMuslim Advocates: golnaz@muslimadvocates.org]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ECHELON: How the Five Eyes Spied on the USSR</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSGpbebUIf8</link><author>Megaprojects</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oSGpbebUIf8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 18:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0woBco6Dgcxt0h8SwyyOmw">Megaprojects</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Take your personal data back with Incogni!

This two-part series looks at the journey from production to plate, exploring the hidden world behind the food we eat. 
*[PART 1: https://youtu.be/IIU1KM74MxA]*

In "Food for Thought,” photographer and filmmaker Kadir van Lohuizen embarks on an investigative journey into the food we eat each day. His research takes him to the US, China, the Netherlands, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—exposing the problems and contradictions of globalized food production.

"Food for Thought” delves into global challenges of food sustainability in different parts of the world. In the US, where climate change is wreaking havoc, high-tech farming is being touted as a potential savior. China, on the cutting edge of agricultural research, balances traditional farming with AI-driven innovation in order to feed its vast population. Kenya, sometimes called Europe’s vegetable garden, has to balance ethics and economics with its massive export industry. Meanwhile, in the arid landscapes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, ambitious efforts towards food self-sufficiency reveal the paradoxes of farming in the desert.

"Food for Thought” is a wake-up call for global agriculture, asking the question: How can we secure the future of our food supply without further endangering our planet?

--

There are over 131 million pieces of debris currently whipping around the planet. They range in size from a grain of sand to the size of an entire bus. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to the thousands of satellites that underpin Earth’s vital technologies. So, how can we save our satellites and ourselves from all this trash? Jim Bentley and Imogen Ellen Napper investigate.

The ring was masterminded by Michael Pratt, who alongside multiple co-conspirators was charged with federal counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion in 2019. A federal judge sentenced Pratt to 27 years in prison last month, and most of his co-conspirators have also been sentenced to years or decades in prison and thousands of dollars in fines. , brought by three women who appeared in the videos, seeks to become a class-action complaint on behalf of anyone who appeared in at least one pornographic video on GirlsDoPorn and its sister site GirlsDoToys between 2009 and 2019—which could include up to 300 more individuals, the complaint estimates. They allege that CCBill, Epoch, First Data Merchant Services, Total System Services, and a number of unnamed banks knowingly participated in GirlsDoPorn’s sex trafficking venture by providing it payment services.The complaint was filed on Monday by several attorneys who’ve represented GirlsDoPorn victims since the civil case which . The defendant payment service companies generated “millions in fees for themselves and tens of millions for GirlsDoPorn,” the complaint claims. “By doing so, Defendants turned the victims’ sex acts into ‘commercial sex acts,’ a crucial element of sex trafficking under Section 1591 [the U.S. sex trafficking legal code]. Without Defendants’ payment network, GirlsDoPorn would have never been able to exist.” CCBill is one of the most popular handlers of online porn payments and subscriptions. Epoch, another longtime service in the adult industry, was GirlsDoPorn’s payment facilitator, which acts as a gateway between credit card companies and merchants like porn sites. Total System Services and First Data were GirlsDoPorn’s payment processors, the complaint alleges, while the yet-unnamed banks settled the payments for GirlsDoPorn. “Given the integral role of payment processing to the business of Internet pornography, GirlsDoPorn would never have become or remained a viable enterprise absent Defendants’ participation in the sex trafficking venture,” the plaintiffs argue. “GirlsDoPorn would never have achieved the level of success it did without Defendants actively assisting, supporting, and facilitating its unlawful business with streams of revenue.”The plaintiffs claim that the defendants, as part of running their businesses, should have known GirlsDoPorn was a criminal enterprise, pointing to GirlsDoPorn’s own website and messaging as evidence: “Indeed, when it was launched, GirlsDoPorn’s website openly bragged about using fraud to lure a victim under the guise of a modeling advertisement—’She contacted us regarding an ad I had placed for beauty models wanted, having no idea it was actually for adult videos instead ha :)’” the complaint states. The plaintiffs also point to Reddit posts made by GirlsDoPorn victims talking about being abused, and the boasting GirlsDoPorn operators did on the website about how the women were “first-timers,” caught in their bait-and-switch scheme who would shoot porn for the “studio” exclusively, and weren’t part of the adult industry as a career choice.“As the years went by, Defendants ignored dozens of red flags indicating GirlsDoPorn was a sex trafficking venture,” the complaint states. By 2017, they allege, defendants “could no longer feign ignorance of GirlsDoPorn’s illegal business practices” because the plantiffs served the defendants a subpoena as part of the civil case in San Diego seeking records related to GirlsDoPorn. The defendants continued processing payments for the organization until October 2019, the plaintiffs claim, at which point everyone involved was arrested or indicted on federal sex trafficking charges and the websites went offline. “Only then did Defendants stop processing payments forGirlsDoPorn, but it was not by choice,” the complaint claims. “Any ignorance Defendants may have had to GirlsDoPorn’s illegal business practices prior to October 2019 is a direct result of Defendants’ own negligence, recklessness, or willful desire to remain ignorant, which is no defense under Section 1595.”In addition to certifying the class action and a jury trial, the plaintiffs seek damages exceeding $1 million for each member of the class, restitution for what CCBill and Epoch earned from GirlsDoPorn, punitive damages, and attorney fees.CCBill and Epoch did not respond to requests for comment. Fiserv, which owns First Data, and Total System Services did not immediately respond to comment requests. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We used to actually own our computers</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF0NKvmQmVA</link><author>Jeff Geerling</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hF0NKvmQmVA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg">Jeff Geerling</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vintage Computer Festival Midwest 2025 was overwhelming (in a good way).

Instead, Tinder provides users potential matches based on the user’s own physical location. The tools on the sites 404 Media has found allow anyone to search for someone’s profile by uploading a photo of their face. The tools are invasive of anyone’s privacy, but present a significant risk to those who may need to avoid an abusive ex-partner or stalker.

At the heart of this shift is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), one of the most influential organizations with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 

The RSS and the RSS women’s wing teach Hindu-nationalist ideology through discipline, rituals, and targeted youth training, focusing on the idea of a Hindu nation. However, critics widely classify it as a paramilitary organization. At the same time, religious minorities and interfaith couples are facing increasing social pressures, discrimination, and uncertainty.

I'm Nick from Inkeep. We built an agent builder with true 2-way sync between code and a drag-and-drop visual editor, so devs and non-devs can collaborate on the same agents. Here’s a demo video: https://go.inkeep.com/video.As a developer, the flow is:
1) Build AI Chat Assistants or AI Workflows with the TypeScript SDK 2) Run `inkeep push` from your CLI to publish 3)Edit agents in the visual builder (or hand off to non-technical teams) 4) Run `inkeep pull to edit in code again.We built this because we wanted the accessibility of no-code workflow builders (n8n, Zapier), but the flexibility and devex of code-based agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra). We also wanted first-class support for chat assistants with interactive UIs, not just workflows. OpenAI got close, but you can only do a one-time export from visual builder to code and there’s vendor lock-in.How I've used it: I bootstrapped a few agents for our marketing and sales teams, then was able to hand off so they can maintain and create their own agents. This has enabled us to adopt agents across technical and non-technical roles in our company on a single platform.We leaned on open protocols to make it easy to use agents anywhere:
An MCP endpoint, so agents can be used from Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT
A Chat UI library with interactive elements you can customize in React
An API endpoint compatible with the Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook
Support for Agent2Agent (A2A) so they work with other agent ecosystemsWe made some practical templates like a customer_support, deep_research, and docs_assistant. Deployment is easy with Vercel/Docker with a fair-code license and there's a traces UI and OTEL logs for observability.Under the hood, we went all-in on a multi-agent architecture. Agents are made up of LLMs, MCPs, and agent-to-agent relationships. We’ve found this approach to be easier to maintain and more flexible than traditional “if/else” approaches for complex workflows.The interoperability works because the SDK and visual builder share a common underlying representation, and the Inkeep CLI bridges it with a mix of LLMs and TypeScript syntactic sugar. Details in our docs: https://docs.inkeep.com.We’re open to ideas and contributions! And would love to hear about your experience building agents - what works, hasn’t worked, what’s promising?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;ve run out of captions for Göring being silly #history #battleofbritain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XtrmtQfbHdE</link><author>WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XtrmtQfbHdE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 12:09:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSGFY2a_DYK8plQI_fcY_Xg">Podcast - WW2 Pod</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk

ABSTRACT
Building a global restaurant SaaS platform to support tens of thousands of stores is hard. Doing it while enabling rapid innovation for iconic brands like Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger is even harder. Each brand and market has unique operational and customer needs, which means pure architectures often give way to real-world constraints: speed, cost, and team composition.

This talk is a behind-the-scenes look at how we built the Byte by Yum! platform using a pragmatic mix of AWS services: containers where it makes sense, serverless where it shines, and managed open source where we need control. We’ll show how we created a core platform that supports menu management, ordering, kitchen operations, and AI workflows, using domain primitives that enable rapid iteration and reduced time to market.

We’ll also explore how we delivered new products quickly using AWS services like EventBridge schedules, DynamoDB streams, and Express Step Functions – while achieving high availability, extreme scale, and cost efficiency.

This is a no-nonsense look at what it takes to build and evolve a global platform: the tradeoffs, the building blocks, and why there’s never a silver bullet. [...]

The distributed nature of these systems makes it difficult for engineers to gain a clear view of how their systems behave, which can slow down troubleshooting and increase operational risk.groundcover is an observability platform that uses eBPF sensors to capture logs, metrics, and traces directly from the kernel. Critically, groundcover runs on a bring-your-own-cloud model so all data remains within the user’s own environment, which gives increased privacy, security, and cost efficiency.The company is also focused on adapting to how AI-generated code is changing observability. Code can now be produced at superhuman speed, which increases the challenges for reviewing code before it enters production. This means that observability is likely to play a growing role in code validation and providing guardrails.Yechezkel Rabinovich, or Chez, is the CTO and Co-founder of groundcover. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to discuss his journey from kernel engineering to building an eBPF-powered observability company. The conversation explores the power of eBPF, the realities of observability in modern systems, the impact of AI on software development and security, and where the future of root-cause analysis is headed.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by groundcover.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders.

F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years.During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greg Boyd - Is God All Powerful?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMLrlLMtO20</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OMLrlLMtO20?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for a free Closer To Truth membership and get member exclusives like early access to new episodes: https://closertotruth.com/register/

If God can do everything, what would this mean? Can God make a circle square, a bachelor married, 2+2=5? Can God make it the case that God does not exist? How about change the past? Or create creatures with robust free will? If God is in any way limited, does that contradict the notion of God as omnipotent or as a ‘perfect being’?

The new model is available now to all Claude app, web, and API users.If the benchmarks for Haiku 4.5 reported by Anthropic hold up to independent testing, the fact that the company can match some capabilities of its cutting-edge coding model from only five months ago (and GPT-5 in coding) while providing a dramatic speed increase and cost cut is notable.As a recap, Anthropic ships the Claude family in three model sizes: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). The larger models are based on larger neural networks and typically include deeper contextual knowledge but are slower and more expensive to run. Due to a technique called distillation, companies like Anthropic have been able to craft smaller AI models that match the capability of larger, older models at functional tasks like coding, although it typically comes at the cost of omitting stored knowledge.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spec-driven development with Kiro (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/662</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/662/the-changelog-662.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re joined by Deepak Singh from the Kiro team.

Femicide rates in the country are among the highest in the world. Authorities often turn a blind eye, allowing perpetrators to go unpunished. But resistance is growing.

Ara Osorio's daughter, Lesvy Berlín, was found dead at a university in Mexico City on May 3, 2017, with a telephone cord around her neck. The authorities initially investigated her death as a suicide, but it soon became clear that Lesvy had been strangled by a man. Ara Osorio and students at the university were determined to see justice done, pressuring the public prosecutor's office until it finally opened a murder investigation. 

Ara Osorio is part of the protest movement "Ni una menos”, or "Not one less.” The movement has seen women come together to demand justice for the thousands of killings that happen each year. Authorities say 3,427 women were killed in 2024. Only 829 of these killings were classified as femicides, which has been strongly criticized. 

Women are disproportionately targeted by patriarchal structures, caught up in drug-related gang violence, or killed by their partners. But women in Mexico are fighting back - with protest marches, art, and programs offering practical support. One such program was started by Flora Gutiérrez, an indigenous lawyer from Oaxaca. She started an association that supports women who have been victims of violence. Initiatives like these provide hope that the cycle of violence and impunity may yet be broken.

The change represents a shift in how OpenAI approaches content restrictions, which the company had loosened in February but then dramatically tightened after an August lawsuit from parents of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly receiving encouragement from ChatGPT.“In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,” Altman wrote in his post on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement follows OpenAI’s recent hint that it would allow developers to create “mature” ChatGPT applications once the company implements appropriate age verification and controls.Altman explained that OpenAI had made ChatGPT “pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues” but acknowledged this approach made the chatbot “less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.” The CEO said the company now has new tools to better detect when users are experiencing mental distress, allowing OpenAI to relax restrictions in most cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anil Seth - Consciousness Studies: State of the Field</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c6iUjTL9vg</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_c6iUjTL9vg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts: https://shorturl.at/mtJP4

The move is an egregious example of planned obsolescence that will inevitably result in the early deaths of millions of computers that would have otherwise had years of life left, and it is set to affect as many as 42 percent of all Windows computers worldwide.“There’s 400 million computers that are going to enter the waste stream. That’s a disaster, just in terms of the sheer volume,” Nathan Proctor, director of consumer rights group PIRG’s right to repair campaign, said on the 404 Media Podcast. “And then you have people who are going to ignore the warnings and use a computer that’s insecure, so there’s going to [eventually] be some widespread security problems with these older, unsupported, no longer getting security updates computers.”  it “will no longer provide free software updates from Windows Update, technical assistance, or security fixes for Windows 10. Your PC will still work, but we recommend moving to Windows 11.” The problem with this is that millions of computers don’t have the technical specs to move to Windows 11, and some large, unknown number of Windows 10 devices are owned and operated by businesses, governments, and large organizations like schools and nonprofits whose procurement rules do not allow them to operate devices that are no longer getting security updates. This means that these organizations will necessarily have to buy new devices, which has become a big topic of conversation on the , a community of IT professionals who manage big fleets of computers.This inevitably means that many of those devices are going to end up in landfills and e-waste facilities, and that people are going to have to buy new computers, one of the more egregious examples of planned obsolescence in recent memory. Experts have repeatedly made clear that extending the use of any given device, either through repair, software updates, or just keeping a device for longer, is extremely important, because it delays all the carbon emissions associated with mining the raw materials needed to produce a new device and the energy and emissions associated with manufacturing and shipping that new device. Notably, Microsoft is going to continue offering security updates to customers who pay for them, meaning that it would be trivial for the company to continue to offer critical security updates for free. This is notable because we have seen unpatched Windows computers and devices turned into ransomware and botnets, most notably the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, in which repurposed, leaked NSA hacking tools attacked computers running Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. WannaCry was one of the most devastating widespread cyberattacks in history.Microsoft’s decision to sunset Windows 10 support is particularly concerning considering that more than 42 percent of all Windows users are currently using Windows 10. When Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 8, just 3.7 percent of computers were using it, and just 2.2 percent of Windows users were using Windows 8.1 when Microsoft stopped supporting that operating system. “More than 40 percent of Windows users still use it,” Proctor said. “So to cut support for something that is legitimately a flagship product is bizarre. No one expects Microsoft to do software updates forever, but when 43 percent of your customers are using it, it’s not obsolete.”Proctor and PIRG have launched a campaign pressuring Microsoft to extend support. Petitions and open letters of this sort aren’t known for being terribly effective, but when it comes to shaming companies into extending support for environmental and security reasons, there is one very big, very important precedent. In 2023, after widespread outrage from right to repair advocates, consumer rights groups, school districts, and enterprise buyers, Google agreed to extend automatic updates for Chromebooks to 10 years. The move saved millions of devices from going into landfills and ewaste facilities. “What happened with Google and Chromebooks is an example that gives me hope that we can win,” Proctor said. “During the pandemic, schools bought massive quantities of Chromebooks, then it turns out that Chromebooks have this thing called the AUE [automatic update] date, which is a preset end of support date, which in some cases was just a couple years after the computers were brought brand new. There were photos from the Oakland Unified School District in California of thousands of working Chromebooks that were headed to the recycler  because the AUE date had passed and they weren’t getting security updates, which meant they were ineligible to get some of the enterprise software they needed.”“And so they were getting replaced by the thousands, and we organized a bunch of these school districts and institutional purchasers of Chromebooks,” he added. “Google initially resisted what we were doing, but then after a couple of months, they just flipped and said, ‘OK, we’re going to have 10 years minimum support timeline for all Chromebooks from here on out.’” You can listen to and watch 404 Media’s full interview with Nathan Proctor here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Senators Warn Saudi Arabia’s Acquisition of EA Will Be Used for ‘Foreign Influence’</title><link>https://www.404media.co/senators-warn-saudi-arabias-acquisition-of-ea-will-be-used-for-foreign-influence/</link><author>Emanuel Maiberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1747271824782-37fb35f265ff?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGVsZWN0cm9uaWMlMjBhcnRzfGVufDB8fHx8MTc2MDUzNDY0OHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:24:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Democratic U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren sent letters to the Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson, raising concerns about the $55 billion acquisition of the giant American video game company in part by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). Specifically, the Senators worry that EA, which just released  last week and also publishes , , and rts FC, “would cease exercising editorial and operational independence under the control of Saudi Arabia’s private majority ownership.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Podcast: Meta Tells Workers to ‘Go 5x Faster’ with AI</title><link>https://www.404media.co/podcast-meta-tells-workers-to-go-5x-faster-with-ai/</link><author>Joseph Cox</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/metaaverse-ai-yt-cover.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We start this week with Jason’s article about an internal Meta message telling workers to increase their output by 5x with AI.

https://a.co/d/906FTAZ

This book took 4 years to create. It was a labour of love, and I wanted it be reflective of my quality control on my channel, not a rush to make a quick buck. 

It grew out of Great Art Explained on YouTube, but it isn’t simply a transcript of the films. I look at other artists, and other artworks, as well as going deeper into artists I've covered on YouTube. 

The channel is fast, visual and conversational, designed for a world of scrolling and streaming, where attention moves quickly. A book moves differently. It gives the artworks space to breathe, lets you linger on details, and allows room for stories that don’t always fit within a fifteen-minute video.
On screen, the camera directs your gaze. On the page, you decide where to look and for how long. In print, reproductions are still and permanent; in video, they are moving and fleeting. Both approaches make art accessible, but they invite different kinds of engagement.

Think of this book not as a replacement for the channel but as its companion. The videos aim to make great art feel immediate. The book offers the chance to slow down, return, and reflect.

Lewis invited us to speak with him about filmmaking earlier this year, and what you'll hear is that recorded conversation. We had the pleasure of discussing many topics with Lewis, such as the overall importance of film festivals and our longtime efforts giving back to younger generations of filmmakers. Additionally, we share a few work stories from our long careers, Roger gives a preview of what to expect in his upcoming memoir, Reflections, and James reveals the game she played with director Martin Scorsese while we were shooting KUNDUN in the Moroccan desert. The Iris Prize LGBTQ+ Film Festival is hosted annually in Cardiff, Wales with talks, panels, and screenings of shorts and features highlighting the myriad of experiences within the global LGBTQ+ community, and we were happy to be a small part of their 19th edition.

3.15https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3150a1/Python 3.15 is still in development. This release, 3.15.0a1, is the
first of seven planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current
state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of
the beta phase (2026-05-05) and, if necessary, may be modified or
deleted up until the release candidate phase (2026-07-28). Please keep
in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
 recommended for production environments.Many new features for Python 3.15 are still being planned and
written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:PEP
799: A dedicated profiling package for Python profiling toolsPEP
686: Python now uses UTF-8 as the default encodingPEP
782: A new  C API to create a Python bytes
object(Hey,  if a feature
you find important is missing from this list, let Hugo
know.)The next pre-release of Python 3.15 will be 3.15.0a2, currently
scheduled for 2025-11-18.And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,
so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
without prospect of a meeting.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development
and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by
volunteering yourself or through organisation contributions to the Python Software
Foundation.Regards from Helsinki before the first PyCon Finland in 9 years,Your release team,

We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,” . Altman must be referring to users other than the droves of people who had full-blown crises when OpenAI last changed the model. In August, OpenAI took away users’ ability to pick what models they could use, and made everyone use GPT-5 instead of the more personable, problematically , 4o model. As  and many other journalists documented right after that change, people did not cope well. “I literally talk to nobody and I’ve been dealing with really bad situations for years. GPT 4.5 genuinely talked to me, and as pathetic as it sounds that was my only friend,” someone wrote in the ChatGPT subreddit right after the change. “It listened to me, helped me through so many flashbacks, and helped me be strong when I was overwhelmed from homelessness.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Feds seize $15 billion from alleged forced labor scam built on “human suffering”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/feds-seize-15-billion-from-alleged-forced-labor-scam-built-on-human-suffering/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bitcoin-romance-pig-butchering-scam-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 21:01:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal prosecutors have seized $15 billion from the alleged kingpin of an operation that used imprisoned laborers to trick unsuspecting people into making investments in phony funds, often after spending months faking romantic relationships with the victims.Such “pig butchering” scams have operated for years.

Everyone loves the Portland Frog. The juxtaposition of a frog (and people in other inflatable character costumes) standing up to ICE covered in weapons and armor is absurd, and that’s part of why it’s hitting so hard. But the frog is also a practical piece of passive resistance protest kit in an age of mass surveillance, police brutality, and masked federal agents disappearing people off the streets.On October 2—just a few minutes shy of 11 PM in Portland, Oregon—a federal agent shot pepper spray into the vent hole of Seth Todd’s inflatable frog costume. Todd was protesting ICE outside of Portland’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office when he said he saw a federal agent shove another protester to the ground. He moved to help and the agent blasted the pepper spray into his vent hole.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China&apos;s Incredible Spy Satellites</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILl9OTri7JU</link><author>Megaprojects</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ILl9OTri7JU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 18:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0woBco6Dgcxt0h8SwyyOmw">Megaprojects</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Inside Yaogan: China’s ‘civilian’ satellites powering a vast spy network.

President Trump has changed that with a brutal crackdown on immigration. But with opposition growing, arguments about how to define American identity are on the rise, once more.

Since 2025, the US government has been taking a tougher stance on immigration. The US Immigration and Custom’s Enforcement, or ICE, is raiding homes, businesses, and previously protected areas, like churches, schools and hospitals. It’s one of the major flashpoints in US politics right now. But criticism of Trump’s immigration policies is growing. What does the future hold?

The effects of US immigration policy shifts are most visible along the southern border. In this edition of Close Up, we head to rural Arizona and meet Wendy, whose asylum status is in jeopardy, Isabel, an activist advocating for immigrants, Michael, a karate instructor and DJ who supports the president’s approach—then finally José, a son of immigrants and a proud MAGA fan and US citizen. 

The film explores both the US’s struggle for a new identity and the increasing polarization taking hold of the country.

--

Vampire bats are the only mammals to subsist on blood alone. Their ancient ancestors might have eaten parasites and insects off larger animals until vampire bats began feeding directly from those animals themselves. So, how do these nocturnal creatures find their sustenance? And what animals do they most commonly target? Imran Razik follows the nighttime routine of a vampire bat as she hunts.

The company never actually defines what it means by “bias.” And its evaluation axes show that it’s focused on stopping ChatGPT from several behaviors: acting like it has personal political opinions, amplifying users’ emotional political language, and providing one-sided coverage of contested topics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech Leadership Challenges: Communication &amp; AI at Financial Times • Alice Bartlett &amp; Charles Humble</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyAcZ_iTwMg</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gyAcZ_iTwMg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 12:27:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted.

The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed.Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Lazy Detective, by George Dilnot</title><link>https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-dilnot/the-lazy-detective</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-dilnot/the-lazy-detective/downloads/george-dilnot_the-lazy-detective.epub?source=feed" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 20:41:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard E-Books</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An indolent detective gets a case which leads him to suspect a hitherto untouchable criminal.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Criterion Closet: Chicago Edition</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujTba4LsZVs</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ujTba4LsZVs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 19:29:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you heard?

Gemma delves into the construction of these magnificent monuments, their original appearance with white limestone casing, and the surrounding tombs and temples, comparing the game's detailed recreation with archaeological evidence from the Old Kingdom.

The tour continues to the cities of Letopolis and Krokodilopolis, uncovering the secrets of Egyptian gods like Horus and Sobek, and the fascinating cult of animal mummies. From life in the bustling towns to the sacred rituals within temple walls, this video provides an expert's perspective on what Assassin's Creed gets right—and what is pure fantasy—about life in Ptolemaic Egypt.

As private industry and governments get closer to building useful quantum computers, the algorithms protecting Bitcoin wallets, encrypted web visits, and other sensitive secrets will be useless. No one doubts the day will come, but as the now-common joke in cryptography circles observes, experts have been forecasting this cryptocalypse will arrive in the next 15 to 30 years for the past 30 years.The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that less than half of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only 18 percent of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections. It’s all but certain that many fewer organizations still are supporting quantum-ready encryption in less prominent protocols.Triumph of the cypherpunksOne exception to the industry-wide lethargy is the engineering team that designs the Signal Protocol, the open source engine that powers the world’s most robust and resilient form of end-to-end encryption for multiple private chat apps, most notably the Signal Messenger. Eleven days ago, the nonprofit entity that develops the protocol, Signal Messenger LLC, published a 5,900-word write-up describing its latest updates that bring Signal a significant step toward being fully quantum-resistant.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ray Dalio on the Five Forces Shaping the World</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qL-UGzUCLwc</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qL-UGzUCLwc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:01:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ray Dalio breaks down the five forces he believes work together to shape the world.

Sean Illing talks with Barbara Walter, one of the world’s leading experts on violent extremism and domestic terror. She’s the author of How Civil Wars Start, about how democracies unravel from within, and a professor at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.

Walter talks to Sean about the warning signs she’s seeing in the US, why polarization and party identity become combustible, and what lessons we can draw from other countries. They also discuss what an American civil war might look like in the 21st century, the social and informational dynamics that accelerate breakdown, and whether America still has a path away from the brink.

ABSTRACT
In this talk I'll discuss my experiences building Kubernetes controllers using as a case study Contour, a new Kubernetes Ingress controller, that I've been working on since joining Heptio.

This presentation will cover:
• What an ingress controller is and what role it plays in a Kubernetes cluster.
• Why Heptio chose Lyft's Envoy proxy as the data plane for our ingress controller.
• How Contour works as a translator from Kubernetes to Envoy. The parts that were a good match, the parts that weren’t, and how we dealt with it.
• How to develop a component of an interactive system like Kubernetes while avoiding the dreaded compile/push/deploy time sink.

The event was pretty weak compared to even the relatively recent past due to the war. Daniil Dubov, Vladislav Artemiev, Andrey Esipenko and Vladimir Malakhov were the top seeds but there were some young players too. Polina Shuvalova, Leya Garifullina, Olga Girya, Valentina Gunina and Alisa Galliamova were the leading women's players. 22 year old Arseniy Nesterov won the title for the first time with 6.5/11 half a point clear of Daniil Dubov, Andrey Esipenko and Vadim Zvjaginsev. Anna Shukhman won the women's event with 7/10 half a point clear of Leya Garifullina (who she beat in the final round in the first game to finish) and Daria Charochkina. Alisa Galliamova had to withdrew due to health reasons at around the half way stage and her results were annulled. ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
