They will discuss Trump's peace plan for Ukraine - which is widely seen as echoing Russian demands. When asked about criticism of his 28-point peace plan for being too favorable to Russia, Trump described it as a "map, not a plan," saying that it has been revised down to 22 points. Trump also stressed that Moscow too was "making concessions," adding that they come in the form that "they stop fighting, and they don't take any more land." Trump moreover said there was no deadline for the talks. "You know what the deadline for me is? When it's over," he said.

In a virtual meeting between Ukraine and its allies, President Volodymyr signalled support for the proposal - but said sensitive issues need to be addressed with President Trump. Despite talks progressing, Russia launched a mass drone assault in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, injuring dozens. Authorities say more than 30 apartment blocks were damaged.

"In scenarios where markets may perform less well, perhaps concerns about the fiscal trajectory or concerns about questions about Fed independence, I think gold would do even better than in the already attractive base case."

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, Rachel Reeves will unveil her second budget today, which is expected to include a slew of tax hikes to fill a £20 billion hole. But higher levies have been a hard sell to voters struggling with affordability, another issue the Chancellor is focused on. 

Bloomberg has learned that White House National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, is being seen as the frontrunner to be the next Fed chair. It comes as the search for Jerome Powell's successor heads into its final weeks.

President Donald Trump says he's dispatched top negotiators for additional high-level meetings with both Russia and Ukraine but would only be willing to meet both leaders when a deal to end the war is in the final stages. The President says Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is likely to meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Moscow next week.

"A Long March 2F rocket fired its engines and lifted off with the Shenzhou 22 spacecraft, carrying cargo instead of a crew, at 11:11 pm EST Monday (04:11 UTC Tuesday)," reports Ars Technica. "The spacecraft docked with the Tiangong station nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the Earth about three-and-a-half hours later." From the report: Chinese engineers worked fast to move up the launch of the Shenzhou 22, originally set to fly next year. On November 4, astronauts discovered one of the two crew ferry ships docked to the Tiangong station had a damaged window, likely from an impact with a small fragment of space junk. [...] Now, 20 days after the saga began, the Tiangong outpost again has a lifeboat for its long-term residents. Astronauts Zhang Lu, Fu Wei, and Zhang Hongzhang will return to Earth on the Shenzhou 22 spacecraft next year, soon after the arrival of their three replacements.
 
The Tiangong astronauts will head outside the station on a spacewalk to inspect the damaged window on Shenzhou 20. Eventually, Shenzhou 20 will depart Tiangong and reenter the atmosphere with cargo. Assuming a smooth landing, Chinese engineers will have an opportunity to get a closer look at the damage on the ground to inform the design of future spacecraft. A preliminary assessment of the window indicates the crack is in the outermost layer of heat-insulating glass in Shenzhou 20's porthole window, according to Chinese state media. Engineers on the ground conducted simulations and wind tunnel ablation tests to determine whether the window might fail during reentry. "The results showed that the cracks would still propagate further," reported CCTV, China's government-run television network. "We held review meeting, and everyone agreed that ensuring the safe return of the astronauts was too risky with the glass damaged," Zhou said.
 
While this crew is just one month into their planned six-month expedition, an emergency could force them to leave the station and return home at any time. Although remote, another collision with space junk, a major systems failure, or a medical emergency involving one of the astronauts could trigger an evacuation. That's why Chinese officials wanted to quickly launch Shenzhou 22 to give the crew a ticket home.The International Space Station follows the same policy, with SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and Russian Soyuz ships serving as lifeboats until their crews' scheduled return to Earth.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Uber and WeRide’s robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi is officially driverless</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/uber-and-werides-robotaxi-service-in-abu-dhabi-is-officially-driverless/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The commercial robotaxi service launched last year.

So what’s actually on the table?
DW’s Misha Komadovsky spoke with Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna, who says Ukraine convinced negotiators in Geneva to drop a “full amnesty” clause — keeping the door open for Russia to be held accountable for war crimes. Stefanishyna offers a unique perspective on diplomacy during the ongoing ukraine war.

And one senior Ukrainian official tells DW that Kyiv now wants a one-on-one meeting with President Trump before any potential trilateral talks with Putin.

While he kicked off his invasion of Chicago with memes and a call to arrest J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, his out of control federal agents have reportedly begun to leave the area. That suburban ICE facility you’ve heard so much about?Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Johnson in a hearing Tuesday said there are currently only four people being held at the Broadview facility, a drastic reduction that comes weeks after detainees there testified they had been crammed into rooms filled with more than 100 people for multiple days.The decline in population comes as federal immigration agents sent to the area as part of the Trump Administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement efforts have begun leaving Chicago ahead of a possible return in the spring.Good, get the fuck out of here.But while the feds were playing war against the domestic enemy of Chicago, they certainly did plenty of damage. Raids disrupted neighborhoods, businesses, and even parade celebrations. The terror in pockets of the city and surrounding area was palpable. Oh, and CBP fucking shot a lady, claiming that she had rammed the cars of federal agents, was armed with a firearm, and boxed agents in putting them in danger. Here is what the DOJ said occurred back in October:“After striking the agents’ vehicle, the defendants’ vehicles boxed in the agents’ vehicle, the complaint states,” prosecutors said in a statement when charges were announced last month. “The agent was unable to move his vehicle and exited the car, at which point he fired approximately five shots from his service weapon at Martinez, the complaint states.”Sounds pretty bad. Really bad, even. Certainly not the sort of thing that the DOJ would just want to drop a month or so later, right?So, how did we go from prosecutors stating that Martinez rammed federal vehicles with her car, boxed them in alongside other drivers, was armed, and that all of that is what led to a CBP agent shooting her several times in “self defense”? That one is easy, actually: CBP was lying about what happened.Martinez’s lawyer, Christopher Parente, indicated during proceedings that he saw the bodycam footage from CBP agents and that it clearly shows that the CBP car swerved into Martinez’s vehicle, not the other way around.“When I watched the video after this agent says, ‘Do something, b—-,’ I see the driver of this vehicle turn the wheel to the left. Which would be consistent with him running into Ms. Martinez’s vehicle, okay,” Parente said. “And then seconds later, he jumps out and just starts shooting.”The gun that DOJ referenced everywhere but in the actually charging documents? Yeah, Martinez has a handgun for which she is licensed to conceal and carry in Illinois,  that firearm never made it out of her purse in this entire incident. CBP had no idea she was armed until after she’d been shot.Oh, and the CBP agent gleefully bragged about just how efficiently he put holes in Martinez’s body.During a Nov. 5 court hearing, CBP Agent Charles Exum, identified as the agent who shot Martinez, was questioned by Parente about text messages he sent to friends and family after the incident in which he appeared to boast about his shooting skills.“I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys,” one of those messages said.When pressed by Parente about the text messages during his testimony, Exum said, “I am a firearms instructor and I take pride in my shooting skills.”Parente then asked, “So you’re bragging that you shot her five times and gets seven holes, five shots? Are you literally bragging about this?”Exum responded, “I’m just saying five shots, seven holes.”And I’m just saying that such assholery is obviously part of the reason the government didn’t think it could win this case.But what this case should do, if nothing else, is serve as exhibit A in every single conversation anyone anywhere has in which someone points to statements by the government as justification for any of the fascistic bullshit the Trump administration is pulling currently. The feds lie. They lie regularly. And while DOJ can do its best to silently slink away from this whole episode, you can be damned sure civil litigation is already being drawn up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Britain Plots Atomic Reboot As Datacenter Demand Surges</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/11/25/231251/britain-plots-atomic-reboot-as-datacenter-demand-surges?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The UK is seeking to fast-track new atomic development to meet soaring energy demands driven by AI and electrification. According to a new report published by the government's Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce, excessive regulation has made Britain the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear projects. The report is calling for a sweeping overhaul to accelerate reactor construction -- everything from "streamlining regulation" to relaxing environmental and safety constraints. The Register reports: The document outlines 47 recommendations for the government, which come under five general areas: providing clearer leadership and direction for the nuclear sector; simplifying the regulatory approval process for atomic projects; reducing risk aversion; addressing incentives to delay progress; and working with the nuclear sector to speed delivery and boost innovation. Among the recommendations is that a Commission for Nuclear Regulation should be established, becoming a "unified decision maker" across all other regulators, planners, and approval bodies. The report also talks of reforming environmental and planning regimes to speed approvals, echoing the government's earlier decisions to streamline the planning process to make it easier for datacenter projects to get built.
 
It recommends amending the cost cap for judicial reviews and limiting legal challenges to Nationally Strategic Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs), while indemnifying nuclear developers against any damages they might incur as a result of proceeding with their project while a judicial review is still being decided. Another recommendation that may be cause for concern is that the government should modify the Habitats Regulations to reduce costs. These are rules created to protect the most important and vulnerable natural sites and wildlife species across the UK. The report also states that radiation limits for workers are overly conservative and well below what could be appropriately considered "broadly acceptable," claiming that they are many times less than what the average person in the UK normally receives in a year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Space Truckin&apos; – The Nostromo (2012)</title><link>https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/</link><author>exvi</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:31:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nostromo towing its refinery through the inky blackness of space.“I was really influenced by three films,” Ridley Scott told Fantastic Films in 1979, on the subject of the Nostromo and its claustrophobic corridors. “Not so much in terms of , but definitely from  and .” The latter film, directed by a young John Carpenter and written by, and starring,  writer Dan O’Bannon, was an inverse, comedic take on  – where Kubrick’s film was cold, sterile, clinical, and philosophical in scope,  was cramped, crowded, shabby, dirty, irreverent and yet also elegiac. “There was a great sense of reality, oddly enough, in ,” continued Scott, “especially of seedy living. It showed you can get grotty even in the Hilton Hotel if you don’t clean it. Everything starts to get tacky, even in the most streamlined surfaces.”“When we did ,” said O’Bannon, “which was in the wake of , we thought we wanted -partly for the novelty, partly because it was realer, mostly just for laughs- we wanted to show this once-sterile spaceship in a rundown condition, like some old bachelor apartment.” For O’Bannon, ‘s ‘used universe’ was not as strong a visual element as he had hoped, and  “didn’t come across all that clearly either.” For , O’Bannon instructed Ridley Scott that “if we want this spacecraft to look industrial [and] beat-up, you’re gonna have to make it about three times messier to the naked eye than you wanna to see it. And  probably was the first time where an audience clearly saw a futuristic machine in a run-down condition.”The design of the Nostromo and the ‘used universe’ aesthetic would be drawn from O’Bannon’s earlier sci-fi effort, coupled with the realism of Kubrick’s Discovery One. “It’s futuristic,” Scott said of Kubrick’s approach to , “but it’s still hung on today’s reality … In two hundred years things won’t change that much, you know. People will still be scruffy or clean. They’ll still clean their teeth three times a day.” Though  itself utilised a used universe (or, as Akira Kurosawa called it, a “maculate reality”), Scott wanted to create a tangible reality opposed to ‘ fantasy-hinged settings and ships. “I wanted to do the truck driver version, the hard-nosed version,” said Scott. “It was supposed to be the anti-thesis of . The reality, the beauty of something absolutely about function.”Before Scott came onto the project as director, writer Dan O’Bannon commissioned his friend and  spaceship designer Ron Cobb to draw what his script was then calling the ‘deep space commercial vessel Snark’ – a nod to Lewis Carroll’s . O’Bannon had promised Cobb a job on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s , but when that film dissolved Cobb, who had terminated the lease on his home and prepared to move to Paris with his wife, was left standing empty-handed. To make up for the letdown, O’Bannon immediately hired Cobb for  which allowed the artist to bounce back from a slump. “He was paid about $400 a week,” Cobb’s wife, Robin Love, told the LA Times in 1988. “We thought it was wonderful!”: “I was working on my first sci-fi film, John Carpenter’s , which would ultimately metastastize into the feature-length . I tried to reach Cobb to get him to design the whole film, but he was unreachable. For weeks his phone rang without an answer, and then it was disconnected, and then I got his new unlisted number but it was invariably answered by one of the girls who were living with him, who always told me he was out. It was impossible. It took another year and a half to track him down and get him to agree to design us a nice, simple little spaceship for our simple little movie. Finally, one night about ten pm, Carpenter and I drove over to Westwood and rousted him out of a sound sleep. He was hung over from an LSD trip and I felt kind of guilty, but I had to have those designs. We took him over to an all-night coffee shop and fed him and got him half-way awake, and then he brought out this pad of yellow graph paper on which he had sketched a 3-view plan of our spaceship. It was wonderful! A little surfboard-shaped starcruiser with a flat bottom for atmospheric landings. Very technological looking. Very high class stuff.”“The first person I hired on , the first person to draw money, was Cobb,” O’Bannon said. “He started turning out renderings, large full-colour paintings, while Shusett and I were still struggling with the script – the corrosive blood of the Alien was Cobb’s idea. It was an intensely creative period – the economic desperation, the all-night sessions, the rushing over to Cobb’s apartment to see the latest painting-in-progress and give him the latest pages.”“I just sat down and started blocking out a ship – which I love to do. Anyway, Dan’s original script called for a small, modest little ship with a small crew. They land on a small planet. They go down a small pyramid and shake up a medium-sized creature. That’s about it. He meant it to be a low budget film, like , and I loved the idea. So I did a few paintings and Dan scurried off with them and a script.”
~ Ron Cobb“And he was doing some incredible stuff,” continued O’Bannon. “Wow! I was really happy during this period, seeing the movie appear under Cobb’s fingers. Of course, we usually had to go over and sit on his back to get him to do any work -otherwise he would just party on with his friends- but how beautiful were the results.”One of Cobb’s early Snark designs.Coupled with Cobb was English artist, Chris Foss, who O’Bannon had come to know during their tenure together on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s . “Alejandro wanted Doug Trumble to do the special effects [for ],” Foss told MTV in 2011, “and of course, Trumble was a big important American, and certainly wouldn’t succumb to Alejandro’s manipulation. So he picked up this gauche American film student, Dan O’Bannon. He was quite hilarious, he said to me once, ‘Hey, these streets are so goddamn small.’ This is Paris, which had some of the widest streets in Europe. Of course, it was only when I got to Los Angeles that I saw what he meant.”Though  would never come to fruition under Jodorowsky, the experience in France influenced O’Bannon’s approach to designing . Jodorowsky had gathered together Chris Foss, Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, and HR Giger to design his film, and the eclectic team would be later reunited by O’Bannon to design his grungy sci-fi horror movie. “Dan said [to Twentieth Century Fox], ‘Hey, we’ve got to get this guy Chris Foss over here.’ So off I went to Los Angeles …A sketch of the temporarily named Leviathan, by Chris Foss.Another Foss sketch. The nose and wings of the ship resemble those of the final design.The early stages of designing  were done in an almost ramshackle, low-fi manner. “We were put through shed after shed after shed,” said Foss of the times, “and they were going through director after director after director.” Ron Cobb told Den of Geek: “I soon found myself hidden away at Fox Studios in an old rehearsal hall above an even older sound stage with Chris Foss and O’Bannon, trying to visualize . For up to five months Chris and I (with Dan supervising) turned out a large amount of artwork, while the producers, Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill and David Giler, looked for a director.”Foss was largely critical of Brandywine’s apparently disinterested approach to setting up the embryonic film. “Walter Hill was very busy smashing cars up for one of his ‘streets’ films,” he told Den of Geek. “He couldn’t be arsed – much too busy! He walked in after months of work and just said, ‘Yep, roomful of spaceships’ and just walked out again.”Ron Cobb, Steven Speilberg, and aliens: Cobb told bttf.com: “I first met Speilberg when I was working on , at one point Speilberg was considered as a possible director for the original . It was just a brief thing, he could never work out his schedule to do it, but he was interested.” Later, one of Cobb’s early story pitches to Speilberg, an alien horror tale called , eventually became 1982’s Though Cobb cameo’d as one of .’s doctors (“I got to carry the little critter,”) he wasn’t pleased with the family-friendly direction that the film took from his initial idea: “A banal retelling of the Christ story,” he told the LA Times. “Sentimental and self-indulgent, a pathetic lost-puppy kind of story.” Luckily for the artist, a clause in his contract for . (he was originally to direct before the story took a turn) detailed that he was to earn 1% of the net profit. His first cheque amounted to $400,000. Cobb’s wife quipped: “friends from Australia always ask, ‘What did you do on .?’ And Ron says, ‘I didn’t direct it.'”When Ridley Scott took over the directorial duties, Cobb and Foss were shipped to England to continue their work. Around this point in time, HR Giger was drawing up the film’s alien, and Moebius was commissioned by Scott to design the film’s space suits, which would be brought into reality by John Mollo. The Snark went through a variety of designs, from a ship embedded in the rock of an asteroid, to an upended pyramidal design, to a hammerhead shape and other varieties of ship with white or yellow or more kaleidoscopic paint-jobs.One of the more unusual designs. “Fanciful Nasa.” By Ron Cobb.After many months of scribbling and painting spaceships, the production was no closer to settling what the vessel would actually look like. Due to script rewrites, it also changed names, from Snark to Leviathan before the name Nostromo was settled on. “I called the ship Nostromo from [Joseph] Conrad,” Walter Hill told Film International in 2004, “[For] no particular metaphoric idea, I just thought it sounded good.”However, indecision was still rife on the actual look of the thing.: “He’s great. A really sweet guy. And, I was soon to realise, a real science-fiction freak …  He brought in a book by the Swiss artist HR Giger. It’s called Necronomicon … I thought, ‘If we can build that [], that’s it.’ I was stunned, really. I flipped. Literally flipped. And O’Bannon lit up like a lightbulb, shining like a quartz iodine. I realised I was dealing with a real SF freak, which I’d never come across before. I thought, ‘My god, I have an egg-head here for this field.'” “O’Bannon introduced me to Ron Cobb, a brilliant visualiser of the genre, with whom he’d worked on . Cobb seemed to have very realistic visions of both the far and near future, so I quickly decided that he would take a very important part in the making of the film.”: “Creating spacecraft exteriors came easily to Foss. His mind and imagination seemed to embody the entire history of the industrial revolution. He could conjure up endless spacecraft designs suggesting submarines, diesel locomotives, Mayan interceptors, Mississippi river boats, jumbo space arks, but best of all (ask Dan) were his trademark aero-spacecraft-textures like panels, cowlings, antennae, bulging fuel tanks, vents, graphics etc. As the months passed, along with two or three temporary directors, Chris began to have problems caused by his spectacular creativity. No one in a position to make a decision seemed to be able to make up their mind and/or choose one of his designs. I think Chris was turning out spacecraft designs the decision makers found too original.”Ridley himself had input on the design: “I was looking for something like , not the fantasy of . I wanted a slow moving, massive piece of steel which was moving along in dead, deep silence … The concept was to have the hull covered with space barnacles or something. I was unable to communicate that idea, and I finally had to go down there and fiddle with the experts. We gradually arrived at a solution.”Foss paints a more hectic process. “Finally what happened was that the bloke who had to make the [Nostromo] model completely lost his rag, scooped up a load of paper -they had a room full of smashed-up bits of helicopter and all-sorts- and he just bodged something together. So the actual spaceship in the film hadn’t anything to do with all the days, weeks, of work that we’d all done. It’s as simple as that.”Cobb explained: “Brian Johnson, the special effects supervisor under pressure to build the large Nostromo model, went into the deserted art department and, out of frustration, grabbed all the Chris Foss designs off the wall and took them to Bray studios. There he would choose the design himself in order to have enough time to build the damn thing.”However, Johnson had also scooped up Cobb’s art, and though Cobb was concentrating on the designs of the ship’s interior, one of his exterior pieces met with approval over Foss’ designs. “Well I soon found out that Brian found and took all of my exterior design sketches as well,” said Cobb. “About a month later I was told that Brian had used my sketch, ‘Nostromo A’, as the basis for the model, even to the extent that it was painted yellow. Ridley found the colour a bit garish and had it repainted grey.”“Ridley had his own very firm ideas about what he physically wanted to do,” Foss said of the process, “and he almost studiously ignored everything that had gone before … I kind of got the impression that Ridley was quietly going his own way, trying to get on with it and get it done, a bit like just another job. I’ve just got dim memories of Ridley being like that and really just ignoring months of input … I just have these memories of feeling a bit miffed that things weren’t put together so much better. And poor old Dan O’Bannon, the bloke whose it was, just got absolutely shafted. He was almost like patted on the head: ‘Yeah Dan, yeah Dan, that’s cool.'”Cobb’s sketches, drawings and paintings for the interiors were also okay’ed by Scott and the production. At first Cobb’s designs were slightly more fantastical, with giant screens and computer readouts and windows covered by protective shells that would open up to reveal alien planets ahead of the ship. Though these ideas were scuppered due to time, money, and logistics, many of Cobb’s early designs and ideas were revisited in .“My first version of the bridge was very spacious indeed; sort of split-level, California style with these huge windows. I had this idea for a spectacular shot where you’d see the approaching planet rolling by on console screens, and then suddenly the windows would open and light would flood in and there would be the actual planet outside doing the same roll as the one on the screen. But it was decided that we couldn’t afford it, and we’d have to go to a  bridge with no windows and a viewing screen.”~ Ron Cobb.“By the time I got to London, Michael Seymour decided he liked the window idea and came up with this hexagon-shaped bridge that was radially symmetrical. Then Ridley wanted overhead consoles, and wanted to make the set tighter, more claustrophobic, like a fighter bomber, and I just started suggesting shapes and forms that would conform to that.”~ Ron Cobb.The ship’s auto-doc, as conceptualised by Cobb.The Nostromo’s life-boat airlock, by Ron Cobb.In addition to designing the Nostromo’s exterior, its bridge and auto-doc, Cobb also designed the ship’s airlocks, cyro-tubes, corridors, bulkheads, an observation dome (not built), Ash’s ‘blister’ observation unit, some of the film’s uniform patches and ship signage, the ‘flying bedstead’ maintenance vehicle (not built), and even Jones’ cat-box. Cobb told Den of Geek that, “My problem with designing Nostromo’s interiors, the control bridge, corridors, auto doc (or med lab), bulkhead doors, the food deck, etc., was that I grew up with a deep fascination for astronomy, astrophysics, and most of all, aerospace flight. My design approach has always been that of a frustrated engineer (as well as a frustrated writer when it came to cinema design). I tend to subscribe to the idea that form follows function. If I’m to arrive at a cinematic spacecraft design that seamlessly preserves, as in this case, the drama of the script, the audience has to experience it as something impressive and believable.”“We’re beyond  in terms of scientific advances,” said Scott of ‘s futurism, “our capabilities are more sophisticated  but our ship’s still NASA-orientated, still Earth-manufactured … in our tongue-in-cheek fantasy we project a not-too-distant future in which there are many vehicles tramping around the universe on mining expeditions, erecting military installations, or whatever. At the culmination of many long voyages, each covering many years, these ships -no doubt part of armadas owned by private corporations- look used, beat-up, covered with graffiti, and uncomfortable. We certainly didn’t design the Nostromo to look like a hotel.”“I didn’t want a conventional shape [for the refinery,] so I drew up a sketch and handed it to the model makers. They refined it, as it were, and built the model. I originally drew it upside-down, with the vague idea that it would resemble a floating inverted cathedral … I think that the machine that they’re on could in fact be 60 years old and just added to over the decades. The metal-work on it could be 50 years old … I would have liked to see it covered with space barnacles or space seaweed, all clogged and choked up, but that was illogical as well.”
~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.The Nostromo model was built under the supervision of Nick Allder and Brian Johnson at Bray Studios, not far from Pinewood, where the live-action scenes were being filmed in parallel with the model shots at Bray. For the refinery, Scott instructed the teams at Bray to make it appear “Victorian Gothic,” with towers and spires and antennae. Bray shop worker Dennis Lowe explained: “At that same time in the workshop Ridley was talking about his first concept of the refinery and he was describing an actual oil refinery with pipes and spires, eventually the term ‘Battleship Bismarck in space’ came up to describe the detailing of the model.”“I spent a couple of months rigging the Nostromo with neon strips and spotlights that would mimic the Mothership from . These were sequenced using motorised rotary switches, Ridley came over from Shepperton after shooting and took a look at my work then made the decision to scrap the idea – such is life!”~ Dennis Lowe.When Ridley arrived after concluding filming at Pinewood, he further revised the ship’s look, removing many of the spires from the refinery, repainting the Nostromo from yellow to grey, and scrapping every piece of footage shot to date, taking it upon himself to re-direct the scenes. “It was a difficult situation,” said Scott, “Brian Johnson was over there [at Bray], working out of context away from the main unit. I could only look at the rushes while I was working with the actors, and that’s not a very satisfactory way of working. In the end, I think a director must be heavily involved with the miniatures, and that’s why I shot them myself.”According to model builder Jon Sorensen, there were no real hard feelings over the redesigns and reshoots. “Ridley Scott then arrived from Shepperton to take an interest in the models and everything changed radically in terms of tone, colour and look. The yellow was sprayed over a uniform grey. Sections were rebuilt. We started over, discarding all previous footage. There was no anger at this. Surprise maybe. But it was Ridley Scott’s film. We liked him. So we entered the  model shoot Part Deux. I recall Bill Pearson and I talking once on what we thought was an empty, lunch-time model stage when a voice spoke from the shadows. Ridley, asking what we were discussing. We answered that maybe that part might look better moved over to there, (we were discussing the refinery). He smiled back and I guess that signalled what was true; we’d go all the way to help him. That night he bought both Bill and I a beer, a move which astonished the Assistant Director, Ray Beckett who complained that in 10 years of working with Ridley, he’d never been bought a beer. So we bought Ray one instead.”Early shot of the yellow Nostromo approaching the alien planet.The revised Nostromo hanging in orbit.The Nostromo interiors were overseen by art director Roger Christian, who had helped craft the sets for . Christian told Shadowlocked.com: “I art-directed  for Ridley Scott with my team because he was struggling to get the designer and the art department to understand ‘that look’ I created with the dressing on  I went into Shepperton, and we built and dressed the first corridor section – actually for a test screen for Sigourney Weaver, who the studios were not sure about. I brought my little team of prop guys who’d understood then the process of what to strip down and how to place it. Because it was not something you just do randomly. It had to be done based on a kind of knowledge.”“Roger is a brilliant set dresser,” Scott told Fantastic Films. “Though his department was not designing the corridors and sets, their ‘cladding’ of the walls made everything look absolutely real. He would go out with his buyers and prop men and visit aircraft dumps or army surplus stores and drag masses of things in for me to see.”“With  I was able to go much further with the oily and gritty look than in ,” said Roger Christian, “and for the first time create a totally believable ‘space truck’, as Ridley described it. The set ended up looking as if we had rented a well-travelled, well-used, oily, dirty, mineral carrier – an unmistakably real and claustrophobic space vessel. I think this really helped audiences to identify with the movie, as the characters were so like space truckers, trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare.”“[The Nostromo’s] like the bloody Queen Mary. Do you get a sense of scale in the interior? That it’s big? We couldn’t build the two to three-hundred foot-long corridors which it would have but it’s supposed to be like one of these huge Japanese super-tankers. Three quarters of a mile long. The refinery behind it god-knows how big. I mean… I dunno. A mile square?”
~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.“Ridley saw the ship very much as a metaphor for a Gothic castle,” said Ron Cobb on the subject of the ship’s interiors, “or a WWII submarine … a kind of retro, accessible technology with great big transistors and very low-res video screens.” However, at one point, Scott had other ideas for the Nostromo’s technology: “I wanted to have wafer-thin screens that are plexiglas, that just float on clips -and of course today you’ve got computer screens exactly like that- because I figured that’s where it [technology] would go. I really got those things off Jean Giraud, Moebius, when he’d been drawing and speculating. A lot of his stuff you see thirty years ago is now.”Cobb acknowledged the Moebius influence, as well as the ship’s other, perhaps subtler, inspirations: “The ship is a strange mixture of retrofitted old technology, a kind of industrial nightmare, like being trapped in a factory … Ridley’s a wonderful artist and he wanted it to look a lot like a Moebius-designed ship, with all kinds of rounds surfaces and with an Egyptian motif.” This Egyptian motif is prevalent in the Weylan-Yutani logo, a wings of Horus design which adorns the uniforms of the crew in addition to their coffee cups, beer cans, etc. The hypersleep chamber also evokes a burial chamber, with the cryo-chambers arranged in a lotus shape. In addition to the Egyptian motif, another influence was Japan. “The owners of the Nostromo are Japanese,” Scott told Fantastic Films.“The interior of the Nostromo was so believable,” HR Giger told Famous Monsters, “I hate these new-looking spacecraft. You feel like they’re just built for the movie you’re seeing. They don’t look real.”“As I was working with the art director,” said Ridley, “I decided to make it faintly glittery. I wanted to have sort of anodized gold everywhere. Not steel, gold. Did you know that space landing craft are covered with gold foil? Amazing! So I thought, Why make this out of steel? Let’s make it all warm and oppressive, massive, and gold.'”The glittery look can be seen in the opening shots of the ship’s computers bleeping into life, and the gold sheen is most prevalent in the ship’s maintenance area, where Brett finds the Alien’s discarded skin moments before his death. Scott explained the design process for the ship’s golden-hued maintenance garage: “We got hold of marvelous, actual parts of actual huge jet engines and installed them, and they’re like a coppery metal with some steel. We used them as four main supports, like columns, and they give a lot of the feeling of a temple. We played the same music we used in the derelict alien craft and we had  temples. The idol I wanted was through these massive gold doors which were as big as a wall, with a gap in them through which the claw [landing leg] can be seen. When that set was dressed, it looked like Aladdin’s Cave … [the garage is] filled with the equipment that the crew would use in their work on and around the refinery, and when they land on various planets – land crawlers, helicopters, other flying machines.”“Ridley has this lavish, sensual visual style,” summarised Dan O’Bannon to Fantastic Films in 1979, “and I think that Ridley is one of the ‘good guys.’ I really think that he was the final pivot point responsible for the picture coming out good.  And so a lot of the visual design and a lot of the mood elements inherent in the camerawork, while they’re not what I planned, are great.  They’re just different.”O’Bannon also nodded to the contributions of Cobb, Foss, Shusett etc., to the picture: “Also, it’s not 100% Ridley either. It’s Ridley superimposing his vision over the cumulative vision of others, you see.  Now this could be such a strong director’s picture because Ridley’s directorial and visual hand is so strong.  There will probably be tendency among critics to refer to it as Ridley Scott’s vision of the future.  And he did have a vision of the future.  But it was everybody else that came before, that’s what his vision is … if it sounds like I’m knocking Ridley, I’m not.”The Nostromo at rest on the alien planetoid.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Plex Is Now Enforcing Remote Play Restrictions On TVs</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/11/25/239252/plex-is-now-enforcing-remote-play-restrictions-on-tvs?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Plex is beginning to enforce new restrictions on remote streaming for its TV apps, requiring either a Plex Pass or the cheaper Remote Watch Pass to watch media from servers outside your home network. How-To Geek reports: Plex is now rolling out the remote watch changes to its Roku TV app. This means that you will need a Plex Pass or Remote Watch Pass for your Plex account if you want to stream media from a server outside your home. If you're only watching media from your own server on the same local network as your Roku device, or the owner of the server you're streaming from has Plex Pass, you don't have to do anything.
 
Plex says this change will come to the other TV apps in 2026, such as Fire TV, Apple TV, and Android TV. Presumably, that will happen when the redesigned app arrives on those platforms. Roku was just the first TV platform to get the new app, which caused a wave of complaints from users about removed functionality and a more clunky redesign. Plex is addressing some of those complaints with more updates, but adding another limitation at the same time isn't a great look.
 
The Remote Watch Pass costs $2 per month or $20 per year, but there's no lifetime purchase option. You can also use a Plex Pass, which normally costs $7 per month, $70 per year, or $250 for a lifetime license. However, there's currently a 40% off sale for Plex Pass subscriptions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revised Ukraine peace plan: A document with potential – or dead-on-arrival in Russia? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdLnMgMI1E</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zBdLnMgMI1E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:01:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[New hopes of a breakthrough in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

The order targets chapters in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, among others, directing US government departments to determine if the chapters are terrorist groups. If the US finds that to be the case, that could lead to sanctions or other measures. Egypt and Jordan have already banned the organization. 

The Muslim Brotherhood was founded almost 100 years ago in Egypt. Its greatest political success was when its leader Mohammed Morsi became president of Egypt in 2012, only to be ousted by the military a year later. It has historical connections to Hamas, which started as a Palestinian nationalist offshoot of the group.

WMG says participating artists will have "full control" over how their likeness and music are used. "These will be new creation experiences from artists who do opt in, which will open up new revenue streams for them and allow you to interact with them in new ways," Suno says, adding that users will be able to "build around" an artist's sounds "and ensure they get compensated." WMG is also dropping its previous lawsuit accusing Suno of scraping copyrighted material.
 
"Along with the licensing agreement, Suno is planning to use licensed music from WMG to build next-gen music generation models that it claims will surpass its flagship v5 model," adds The Verge. "It will also start requiring users to have a paid account to download songs starting next year, with each tier providing a specific number of downloads each month."

					I care about academic collaboration and misconduct because it is important both that we are able to evaluate
					your own work (independent of your peer’s)
					and because not claiming others’ work as your own is an important part of integrity in your future career. I
					understand that different
					institutions and locations can have different definitions of what forms of collaborative behavior is
					considered
					acceptable. In this class,
					for written homework problems, you are welcome to discuss ideas with others, but you are expected to write up
					your own solutions
					independently (without referring to another’s solutions). For coding, you may only share the input-output behavior
					of your programs. This encourages you to work separately but share ideas
					on how to test your implementation. 
				

Please remember that if you share your solution with another student, even
					if you did not copy from
					another, you are still violating the honor code.

Consistent with this, it is also considered an honor code violation if you make your assignment solutions publicly available, such as posting them online or in a 
public git repo.


					
					We may run similarity-detection software over all submitted student programs, including programs from
					past quarters and any
					solutions found online on public websites. Anyone violating the Stanford University
					Honor Code will be referred to the
					Office of Judicial Affairs.
					If you think you made a mistake (it can happen, especially under stress or when time is short!), please reach
					out to Emma or the head CA;
					the consequences will be much less severe than if we approach you.

					We expect all students to submit their own solutions to CS234 homeworks, exams and quizzes, and 
					for projects. You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as Gemini, GPT-4 and Co-Pilot 
					in the same way that human collaboration is considered acceptable: you are not allowed to directly 
					ask for solutions or copy code, and you should indicate if you have used generative AI tools. 
					Similar to human collaboration help, you are ultimately responsible and accountable for your own work.
					We may check students' homework, exams and projects to 
				enforce this policy. 
				Note that it is not acceptable to list a LLM as a collaborator on the project 
					milestone or final report: as things stand, generative AI cannot accept 
					fault or responsibility, and thus cannot be a collaborator in a final project.

Maps will soon let you use a nickname and select an alternative profile picture for online reviews, so you can rate a business without linking it to full name and Google profile photo. Google says it will monitor for "suspicious and fake reviews," and every review is still associated with an account on Google's backend, which it believes will discourage bad actors.
 
Look for a new option under Your Profile that says Use a custom name & picture for posting. You'll then be able to pick an illustration to represent you and add a nickname. Google didn't explain why it is introducing anonymous reviews; it pitched the idea as a way to be a business's "Secret Santa." Some users are nervous to publicly post reviews for local businesses as it may be used to track their location or movements. It may encourage more people to contribute honest feedback to its platform, for better or worse.

Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the project's overall health. This blog post outlines planned changes for the v1.35 release that the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes cluster(s), and to keep you up to date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.35 release and is subject to change before the final release date.Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.35On Linux nodes, container runtimes typically rely on cgroups (short for "control groups").
Support for using cgroup v2 has been stable in Kubernetes since v1.25, providing an alternative to the original v1 cgroup support. While cgroup v1 provided the initial resource control mechanism, it suffered from well-known
inconsistencies and limitations. Adding support for cgroup v2 allowed use of a unified control group hierarchy, improved resource isolation, and served as the foundation for modern features, making legacy cgroup v1 support ready for removal.
The removal of cgroup v1 support will only impact cluster administrators running nodes on older Linux distributions that do not support cgroup v2; on those nodes, the  will fail to start. Administrators must migrate their nodes to systems with cgroup v2 enabled. More details on compatibility requirements will be available in a blog post soon after the v1.35 release.Deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxyMany releases ago, the Kubernetes project implemented an ipvs mode in . It was adopted as a way to provide high-performance service load balancing, with better performance than the existing  mode. However, maintaining feature parity between ipvs and other kube-proxy modes became difficult, due to technical complexity and diverging requirements. This created significant technical debt and made the ipvs backend impractical to support alongside newer networking capabilities.The Kubernetes project intends to deprecate kube-proxy  mode in the v1.35 release, to streamline the  codebase. For Linux nodes, the recommended  mode is already nftables.Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1.y supportWhile Kubernetes v1.35 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases of containerd, as a consequence of automated cgroup driver detection, the Kubernetes SIG Node community has formally agreed upon a final support timeline for containerd v1.X. Kubernetes v1.35 is the last release to offer this support (aligned with containerd 1.7 EOL).This is a final warning that if you are using containerd 1.X, you must switch to 2.0 or later before upgrading Kubernetes to the next version. You are able to monitor the kubelet_cri_losing_support metric to determine if any nodes in your cluster are using a containerd version that will soon be unsupported.Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.35The following enhancements are some of those likely to be included in the v1.35 release. This is not a commitment, and the release content is subject to change.When scheduling Pods, Kubernetes uses node labels, taints, and tolerations to match workload requirements with node capabilities. However, managing feature compatibility becomes challenging during cluster upgrades due to version skew between the control plane and nodes. This can lead to Pods being scheduled on nodes that lack required features, resulting in runtime failures.The  framework will introduce a standard mechanism for nodes to declare their supported Kubernetes features. With the new alpha feature enabled, a Node reports the features it can support, publishing this information to the control plane through a new  field. Then, the , admission controllers and third-party components can use these declarations. For example, you can enforce scheduling and API validation constraints, ensuring that Pods run only on compatible nodes.This approach reduces manual node labeling, improves scheduling accuracy, and prevents incompatible pod placements proactively. It also integrates with the Cluster Autoscaler for informed scale-up decisions. Feature declarations are temporary and tied to Kubernetes feature gates, enabling safe rollout and cleanup.Targeting alpha in v1.35,  aims to solve version skew scheduling issues by making node capabilities explicit, enhancing reliability and cluster stability in heterogeneous version environments.To learn more about this before the official documentation is published, you can read KEP-5328.In-place update of Pod resourcesKubernetes is graduating in-place updates for Pod resources to General Availability (GA). This feature allows users to adjust  and  resources without restarting Pods or Containers. Previously, such modifications required recreating Pods, which could disrupt workloads, particularly for stateful or batch applications.
Previous Kubernetes releases already allowed you to change infrastructure resources settings (requests and limits) for existing Pods. This allows for smoother vertical scaling, improves efficiency, and can also simplify solution development.The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) has also been improved, extending the  API for Windows and future runtimes while allowing  to report real-time resource configurations. Together, these changes make scaling in Kubernetes faster, more flexible, and disruption-free.
The feature was introduced as alpha in v1.27, graduated to beta in v1.33, and is targeting graduation to stable in v1.35.When running microservices, Pods often require a strong cryptographic identity to authenticate with each other using mutual TLS (mTLS). While Kubernetes provides Service Account tokens, these are designed for authenticating to the API server, not for general-purpose workload identity.Before this enhancement, operators had to rely on complex, external projects like SPIFFE/SPIRE or cert-manager to provision and rotate certificates for their workloads. But what if you could issue a unique, short-lived certificate to your Pods natively and automatically? KEP-4317 is designed to enable such native workload identity. It opens up various possibilities for securing pod-to-pod communication by allowing the  to request and mount certificates for a Pod via a projected volume.This provides a built-in mechanism for workload identity, complete with automated certificate rotation, significantly simplifying the setup of service meshes and other zero-trust network policies. This feature was introduced as alpha in v1.34 and is targeting beta in v1.35.Numeric values for taintsKubernetes is enhancing taints and tolerations by adding numeric comparison operators, such as  (Greater Than) and  (Less Than).Previously, tolerations supported only exact () or existence () matches, which were not suitable for numeric properties such as reliability SLAs.With this change, a Pod can use a toleration to "opt-in" to nodes that meet a specific numeric threshold. For example, a Pod can require a Node with an SLA taint value greater than 950 (, ).This approach is more powerful than Node Affinity because it supports the NoExecute effect, allowing Pods to be automatically evicted if a node's numeric value drops below the tolerated threshold.When running Pods, you can use  to drop privileges, but containers inside the pod often still run as root (UID 0). This simplicity poses a significant challenge, as that container UID 0 maps directly to the host's root user.Before this enhancement, a container breakout vulnerability could grant an attacker full root access to the node. But what if you could dynamically remap the container's root user to a safe, unprivileged user on the host? KEP-127 specifically allows such native support for Linux User Namespaces. It opens up various possibilities for pod security by isolating container and host user/group IDs. This allows a process to have root privileges (UID 0) within its namespace, while running as a non-privileged, high-numbered UID on the host.Released as alpha in v1.25 and beta in v1.30, this feature continues to progress through beta maturity, paving the way for truly "rootless" containers that drastically reduce the attack surface for a whole class of security vulnerabilities.Support for mounting OCI images as volumesWhen provisioning a Pod, you often need to bundle data, binaries, or configuration files for your containers.
Before this enhancement, people often included that kind of data directly into the main container image, or required a custom init container to download and unpack files into an . You can still take either of those approaches, of course.But what if you could populate a volume directly from a data-only artifact in an OCI registry, just like pulling a container image? Kubernetes v1.31 added support for the  volume type, allowing Pods to pull and unpack OCI container image artifacts into a volume declaratively.This allows for seamless distribution of data, binaries, or ML models using standard registry tooling, completely decoupling data from the container image and eliminating the need for complex init containers or startup scripts.
This volume type has been in beta since v1.33 and will likely be enabled by default in v1.35.New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.35 as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.The Kubernetes v1.35 release is planned for .

AppleInsider reports: On November 25, Poland's UOKiK has started another investigation into App Tracking Transparency, and whether Apple had restricted competition in mobile advertising. Reuters reports that, to the anti-monopoly regulator, ATT may have limited advertisers' ability to collect user data for advertising purposes while simultaneously favoring Apple's ad program. On November 25, Poland's UOKiK has started another investigation into App Tracking Transparency, and whether Apple had restricted competition in mobile advertising. Reuters reports that, to the anti-monopoly regulator, ATT may have limited advertisers' ability to collect user data for advertising purposes while simultaneously favoring Apple's ad program.
 
This is not the first time that Poland has looked into ATT rules. In December 2021, the regulator held a similar probe following criticism from advertisers. It's not clear what that complaint determined, or if it is still ongoing. Regardless, in the new complaint, the logic is that Apple had a competitive advantage since its own apps were not subject to ATT rules, but third-party apps did have to deal with ATT. Since Apple didn't visibly ask for consent for its first-party apps in the same way, there is a presumption that Apple's rules only applied to other companies.
 
This is despite Apple's repeated insistence that it doesn't use the same kinds of collected data in its own apps and services for marketing purposes, as well as its stance on privacy in general. In short, Apple apps don't use the data, so it doesn't pop up a dialog box asking the user if the app can use the data. There is also the argument that, in setting up an account with Apple, users are providing blanket consent to the company. Implementing ATT on its own apps would therefore be a waste of time, since that consent was already granted. Apple said that it will work with the regulator on the matter, but warned that it could force them to withdraw the feature "to the detriment of European consumers."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reporter Extra: Chatbots Are Designed to Please You — Here’s Why That’s a Problem</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WaLS0lM4-1o</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WaLS0lM4-1o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 23:06:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vox senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes has a cautionary tale about chatbots.

"The problem is that according to current neuroscience, human thinking is largely independent of human language -- and we have little reason to believe ever more sophisticated modeling of language will create a form of intelligence that meets or surpasses our own," writes Riley. Slashdot reader RossCWilliams shares the report, writing: The article goes on to point out that we use language to communicate. We use it to create metaphors to describe our reasoning. That people who have lost their language ability can still show reasoning. That human beings create knowledge when they become dissatisfied with the current metaphor. Einstein's theory of relativity was not based on scientific research. He developed it as thought experiment because he was dissatisfied with the existing metaphor. It quotes someone who said, "common sense is a collection of dead metaphors." And that AI, at best, can rearrange those dead metaphors in interesting ways. But it will never be dissatisfied with the data it has or an existing metaphor.
 
A different critique (PDF) has pointed out that even as a language model AI is flawed by its reliance on the internet. The languages used on the internet are unrepresentative of the languages in the world. And other languages contain unique descriptions/metaphors that are not found on the internet. My metaphor for what was discussed was the descriptions of the kinds of snow that exist in Inuit languages that describe qualities nowhere found in European languages. If those metaphors aren't found on the internet, AI will never be able create them.
 
This does not mean that AI isn't useful. But it is not remotely human intelligence. That is just a poor metaphor. We need a better one.

Or at least not another one about how we build and ship. That problem was done and dusted. .NET had done it! We’d struck a balance between distributed repository development and the ability to quickly compose a product for shipping. Congratulations everyone, now the infrastructure teams could focus on other things. Security, cross-company standardization, support for building new product features. All the good stuff.…A year and a half later…We’re asking how much it will cost to build 3-4 major versions with a dozen .NET SDK bands between them each month. And keep their engineering systems up to date. And hey, there’s this late breaking fix we want to get into next week’s release, so can I check it in today and have the team validate tonight? It can’t be  hard, right? And I have this new cross-stack feature that I want to do some prototyping on…how can I build it?The answers were mostly frustrating:“It’ll cost a lot, and get worse over time.““I don’t think we have enough time for that fix, I can only guess how long the build will take, but it’s at least 36 hours before we can handoff to validation. Maybe more?““I’m sure we can keep that much infrastructure alive, but we’ll slowly drown under the cost of keeping it up to date.““How critical is it that you have a full stack to work with? It’ll take a while to set that up.“These are  the answers we want to be giving. And so, we went back to the drawing board, looking for solutions.This blog post is about the Unified Build project: .NET’s effort to resolve many of these issues by moving product construction into a ‘virtual monolithic’ repository, consolidating the build into a series of ‘vertical builds’, while still enabling contributors to work outside the monolith. I’ll briefly tell the story of our product construction journey over the life of .NET. I’ll draw attention to the lessons we’ve learned about applying a distributed product construction model to a single product, particularly its drawbacks in overhead and complexity. Finally, I’ll dig into the details of Unified Build and its foundational technology, Linux distro Source Build. We’ll look at the new method of product construction and the results we’re seeing.How did we get here? This is not my beautiful build infrastructure.NET was born out of the closed source infrastructure of the .NET Framework and Silverlight in 2015-2016. It was made open source incrementally as we readied its components for external consumption, and as was the fashion at the time, we split it into multiple repositories. CoreCLR represented the base runtime, CoreFX the libraries, Core-Setup the packaging and installation. Along came ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework Core, and an SDK with a CLI. A few releases saw major revamps of the product in the form of shared frameworks, with WindowsDesktop joining the fold. More repositories and more complexity.What is important to understand is that .NET is a product that is developed in separate inter-dependent repositories but needs to be composed together in a relatively short period of time to ship. On paper, the ‘graph’ of the product looks much like any open source ecosystem. A repository produces some software component, publishes it to public registries, and downstream consumers take a dependency on the new component, and publish their own updates. It’s a producer-consumer model where changes ripple through the ‘global’ dependency graph via a series of pull->build->publish operations. This model is highly distributed and effective, but it is not necessarily efficient in a time sense. It enables software vendors and repository owners to have significant autonomy over their process and schedules. However, attempting to apply this methodology to a product like .NET, which represents its components using separate, but inter-dependent repositories, has major drawbacks.Let’s call this a “distributed product construction methodology”. To get a sense of why it can be a difficult methodology to use, let’s take a look at the process to produce a security release.Example: Security ServicingConsider shipping a security patch. A security vulnerability is discovered somewhere in the .NET Runtime libraries. Because .NET is descended from .NET Framework, let’s say this security vulnerability is also present in .NET Framework 4.7.2. It becomes absolutely vital that .NET’s security update goes out in tandem with the .NET Framework update, or one will zero-day the other. .NET has numerous Microsoft-managed release paths. Microsoft Update, our CDN, Linux and container package registries, nuget.org, Visual Studio, Azure Marketplace, and on and on. That puts some restrictions on timeline. We need to be able to be predictable..NET’s development structure looks a lot like a typical open source ecosystem. The .NET Runtime, the .NET SDK, ASP.NET Core and the WindowsDesktop shared framework are developed by different teams, though with a huge amount of cross-collaboration. They are developed, at times, like independent products. The .NET Runtime forms the base of the product. ASP.NET Core and WindowsDesktop are built on top of that. A huge quantity of the dev tooling (C#, F#, MSBuild) is built on top of the surface area of the .NET Runtime and some auxiliary libraries. The SDK gathers up and builds a CLI, along with tasks, targets and tooling. Much of the shared framework and tooling content is redistributed in-box.To build and ship this security patch, we need coordination between the many teams that contribute to the .NET product as a whole. We need the lowest levels of the .NET graph (see below) to build their assets, then feed them downstream to consumers. They need take the update, build, and feed downstream. This will happen continually until the product is “coherent”; no new changes are being fed into the graph and everyone agrees on a single version of each component in the product. Coherency ensures that a component with changes is ingested everywhere that redistributes the component, or information about it. Then, we want to do our validation, take all the shippable assets from the closure of all those unreleased components, and then release them all at once to the world.This is a lot of moving parts that need to work well together in a short period of time.Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributes EcosystemsIt’s important to note that this distributed ecosystem style of development  have a lot of advantages: – Repository boundaries tend to encourage layering and less tightly bound products. During the major version development lifecycle, the individual components of the stack generally remain roughly compatible, even as changes flow quickly and unevenly through the graph. – Repository boundaries tend to encourage good, focused communities. The WPF and Winforms communities, for instance, are often distinct. Small repos are also generally more approachable., – Distributed development often allows for incremental changes. For instance, we can make breaking changes to the System.CommandLine surface area, then ingest those in the consumers over time. This doesn’t work all the time (e.g. let’s say the SDK is attempting to ship just one copy of System.Text.Json for all of the tooling to use, but not every consumer agrees on that surface area. Boom?!), but it’s reasonably reliable. – Smaller, focused repositories tend to have better inner-loop experiences. Even something as simple as  or  is faster in a small repository. The repository boundary tends to give the (possibly illusory) sense that for your change, you only need to worry about the code and tests you can see. – Incrementality helps development be more asynchronous. If my component flows to three downstream consumers who work in three different time zones, those teams can make progress on their own components in their own time, rather than needing to coordinate.Low-Cost Sharding/Incremental Builds – Distributed development allows for ‘optimizing’ away builds of components that don’t change every often and are at the fringes of a dependency graph. For instance, a leaf node that builds some static test assets doesn’t need to be rebuilt every time there is a change to the sdk. The last built assets are just fine.If you squint and peer between the lines here though, a lot of the advantages of the distributed model are its significant weaknesses when we need to build and ship software that requires changes in a significant portion of the graph to be completed in a short period of time. Changes at scale across large graphs are often slow and unpredictable. But why? Is there something inherently wrong with this model? Not really. In typical OSS ecosystems (e.g. NuGet or NodeJS package ecosystems), these aspects are often . These ecosystems do not optimize for speed or predictability. Instead, they value the autonomy of each node. Each node needs only to concern itself with what it needs to  and what it needs to  and the changes required to meet those needs. However, when we attempt to apply the distributed model to shipping software quickly, we often struggle because it increases the prevalence of two key concepts, which I’m calling Product Construction Complexity and Product Construction Overhead. Together these combine to slow us down and make us less predictable.Product Construction ComplexityIn the context of product construction, ‘complexity’ refers to the quantity of steps that are required for a change to go from a developer’s machine to that change being delivered to customers in all the ways that it needs to be delivered. I recognize that this is a fairly abstract definition. “Step” could mean different things depending on what level of granularity you want to look at. For now, let’s focus on conceptual product construction steps, as shown in the example graph below:.NET began with a relatively simple product dependency graph and matching tools to manage that graph. As it grew, new repositories were added to the graph and additional dependency flow was required to construct the product. The graph grew more complex. We invented new tools (Maestro, our dependency flow system) to manage it. It was now easier than ever to add new dependencies. A developer or team looking to add new functionality to the product could often just create a new repository and build and set up the inputs and outputs. They only needed to know how that component fit within a small subsection of the larger product construction graph in order to add a new node. However, .NET doesn’t ship each individual unit independently. The product must become “coherent”, where everyone agrees on the versions of their dependencies, in order to ship. Dependencies or metadata about them are redistributed. You have to “visit” all of the edges. Note: While we do not need to rev every component in the graph, there is a significant portion that changes on every release, either due to fixes or dependency flow. Then you take the outputs of each individual node, combine them all together, and out the door you go.More complex graphs have significant downsides:The more edges and nodes, the longer it tends to take to achieve coherency.Teams are more likely to make a mistake. There are more coordination points, and more points in the workflow where a human can influence an outcome. Tools can help, but they only go so far.Complexity can also encourage variance in build environment and requirements. It’s hard to keep everyone aligned on the same processes as teams move and upgrade at different rates. Reproducing that full set of environments can be expensive, and that cost tends to increase over time as infrastructure “rots”.Product Construction OverheadWe define overhead as “the amount of time spent not actively producing artifacts that we can ship to customers“. Like complexity, it can be evaluated on a different level of granularity depending on how detailed you want to get. Let’s take a look at two quick examples, and then at the overhead in one of .NET’s older builds.A simple multi-repo product construction process might look like the following:In the above graph, the overhead nodes (dotted nodes) do not actively contribute to the production of the packages in D. The time it takes the dependency flow service to create the PR is overhead. Waiting for a dev to notice and review the PR is overhead. Waiting for approval for package push is overhead. That’s not to say that these steps aren’t , just that they are places where we say we’re not actively creating outputs for customers.How about builds? If we zoom into a repository build process, we can often see quite a lot of overhead. Consider this very simple build:There are a few interesting measures of overhead in a system. We can measure it a % of overall time. Add up the time spent in each step based on its classification, then divide the total overhead by the total time. This gives a nice measure of overall resource efficiency. However, from a wall clock perspective, overall overhead doesn’t tell us much. To understand overhead’s effect on the end-to-end time, we find the longest path by time through our product construction graph, then compute the total overhead in steps that contribute to that path as compared to the total time in the path.To understand what that overhead might look like in a single .NET build, let’s take a look at an 8.0 build of runtime. This data was generated using a custom tool that can evaluate an Azure DevOps build based on a set of patterns that classify each step.Percentage of overall build timeHere are the three longest paths from that build:(Stage) Build->Mono browser AOT offsets->windows-x64 release CrossAOT_Mono crossaot->Build Workloads->(Stage) Prepare for Publish->Prepare Signed Artifacts->Publish Assets(Stage) Build->windows-arm64 release CoreCLR ->Build Workloads->(Stage) Prepare for Publish->Prepare Signed Artifacts->Publish Assets(Stage) Build->Mono android AOT offsets->windows-x64 release CrossAOT_Mono crossaot->Build Workloads->(Stage) Prepare for Publish->Prepare Signed Artifacts->Publish AssetsOverhead + Complexity = TimeOverhead is unavoidable. There is some level inherent in every product construction process. However, when we add complexity to our product construction processes, especially complexity in the graph, the overhead tends to begin to dominate the process. It sort of multiplies. Rather than paying the machine queue time cost one time, you might pay it 10 times over within a single path through the graph. After those machines are allocated, you then clone the repo each time. The efficiency scaling of these steps tends to also be worse because there is some fixed cost associated with each one. For instance, if it takes 10 seconds to scan 10MB of artifacts, and 1 second to prepare for the scan, collate and upload the results, it takes longer to do that step 10 times in a row than it does to scan the full 100MB at once. 110 vs. 101 seconds.What is also insidious is that this cost tends to hide and increase over time. It’s not always obvious. A local repository build for a developer is typically fast. The developer does not see any overhead of the overall CI system in that build. Zooming out, building the repository in a job in a pipeline can be similarly quick, but starts to incur some overhead. You have the quick build of that repository, but extra overhead steps around it. You’re still reasonably efficient though. Then let’s say you zoom out a little and you have some additional jobs in that pipeline, doing other things. Maybe reusing artifacts from other parts of the build, building containers, etc. Overhead will start to become a larger overall % of the long path time. Now, zoom out again, and you’re looking at the place of that pipeline and associated repositories in context of your larger product construction. You add in time for dev PR approvals, dependency flow systems to do their work, more cloning, more building, more compliance, more more more.In a distributed product construction system, decisions that affect complexity, and therefore overhead, can be made at a level that does not see the overall overhead in the system. A new node is added. In isolation, it’s fine. In context, it costs.While no graph of complexity was ever made for the .NET 8 timeframe that could show the complexity of each individual component build in context of the whole product construction graph, consider what the job graph for the runtime build alone looked like. Each bubble below represents a separate machine.The roots of Unified Build in Source Build.NET Source Build is a way that Linux distributions can build .NET in an isolated environment from a single, unified source layout. Microsoft started working on it around .NET Core 1.1. The spiritual roots of Unified Build grew from hallway conversations between the team working on .NET Source Build and the team responsible for the Microsoft distribution. I won’t say it wasn’t in jealousy that the infrastructure teams often looked at how long it took to build the .NET product within the Source Build infrastructure.  Shorter than it took to build just the runtime repository from scratch in its official CI build. Now granted, it wasn’t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. After all, Source Build:Only builds one platform.Doesn’t build any of the Windows-only assets (e.g. WindowsDesktop shared framework)/Doesn’t build .NET workloads.Doesn’t do any installer packaging.Doesn’t build the tests by defaultAll very reasonable caveats. But enough caveats to add up to 10s of hours in differences in build time?  Much more likely is that the Source Build methodology is  and . More than just time, there were other obvious benefits. Unified toolsets, easier cross-stack development, and perhaps most importantly, hard guarantees of what was being built and its build-time dependencies.Back to those hallway conversations. Source Build’s obvious benefits led to occasional probing questions from various members of the .NET team. Most of the form: So…why doesn’t Microsoft build its distribution that way? Answer: It’s hard.Why is it hard? A detour into the land of Source BuildMicrosoft began efforts to make Source Build a ‘real’ piece of machinery around the .NET 3.1 timeframe. Prior to this point, the Source Build distribution tended to look more like a one-off effort for each .NET major release. It was too difficult to keep working all the time, so the team worked, starting in the spring as the new product took shape, to bring the new .NET version into line with Linux distro maintainer requirements. To understand why it’s so hard to fit Microsoft’s distribution of .NET into this model as part of the Unified Build project, let’s look back into why it was so hard to get the Source Build project into a turn crank state in the first place.To allow our distro partners to distribute .NET we needed to produce an infrastructure system that produced a .NET SDK within the following constraints:Single implementation! – Only one implementation per componentSingle platform – Only build for one platform (the one that distro partners are trying to ship)Single build – Only build on one machine. We can’t require a complex orchestration infrastructure.Linux Distro Build RequirementsLinux distros generally have stricter rules and less flexibility when building software that will go into their package feeds. The build is usually completed offline (disconnected from the internet). It may only use as inputs artifacts that have been previously created in that build system. Checked-in binaries are not allowed (though they can be eliminated at build time). Any source in the repository must meet strict licensing requirements.  At a conceptual level, a Linux distro partner wants to be able to trace every artifact they ship to a set of sources and processes that they can reasonably edit. All future software should be built from previously Source Build produced artifacts. .Single Build – A repo and orchestration framework to stitch the stack togetherAs you’ve learned earlier, the .NET build, like many products, is actually comprised of the Azure DevOps builds of various components, stitched together with dependency updates. This means that the information and mechanics required to construct the product is distributed between the repositories (build logic within the build system and associated scripting, as well as YAML files processed by Azure DevOps) and the dependency flow information held by our ‘Maestro’ system (producer-consumer information). This isn’t usable for our Linux distro partners. They need to be able to build the product without access to these Microsoft resources. And they need to be able to do so in a way that is practical for their environments. Manually stitching together a product from a build graph isn’t reasonable. We need an orchestrator that encapsulates that information.The Source Build layout and orchestratorThe orchestrator replaces the tasks that Azure DevOps and Maestro perform for .NET’s distributed build with ones that can be run from a single source layout, disconnected from the internet. You can see the modern, updated layout and orchestrator over at dotnet/dotnet. – A single source layout with a copy of all components required to build the product. Submodules are flattened, if they exist (typically for external OSS components). The contents of the source layout are determined by identifying an annotated dependency for each component within the product graph, rooted at dotnet/sdk. The sha for that annotated dependency determines what content will populate the layout. Note: dependencies like compilers and OS libs are provided by the build environment.Information on how each component should be built, and its dependencies – For each of the components within the single source layout, a basic project is provided which identifies how the component is built. In addition, the component level dependencies are also identified. i.e. the .NET Runtime needs to be built before ASP.NET Core can start.<ItemGroup>
<RepositoryReference Include="arcade" />
<RepositoryReference Include="runtime" />
<RepositoryReference Include="xdt" />
</ItemGroup> – The build orchestrator logic is responsible for launching each build in the graph when it is ready (any dependencies have been successfully built), as well as inputs and outputs of each component. After a component build has been completed, the orchestrator is responsible for identifying the outputs and preparing inputs for downstream component builds. Think of this as a local Dependabot, computing the intersection of the declared input repositories against the package level dependency info (see aspnetcore’s) for an example. More information on how dependency tracking works in .NET builds can be found in my previous blog post. – The comparatively stricter environments that our Linux distro partners build in mean that it’s necessary that we build some automation to identify potential problems. The orchestrator can identify pre-built binary inputs, ‘poison’ leaks (previously source-built assets appearing in the current build outputs), and other hazards that might block our partners. – Most of our test logic remains in the individual repositories (more on that later), but the layout also includes smoke tests.Single Implementation – Pre-built squeaky cleanThere are some obvious and non-obvious reasons why these requirements would be hard to meet using the ‘stock’ Microsoft build of .NET, and why Source Build required so much work. An offline build with pre-staged, identified inputs that are  is a major undertaking. When the Source Build team began to investigate what this meant, it was quickly obvious that a LOT of interesting behavior was hiding in the .NET product build. Sure, binary inputs like optimization data were obviously disallowed, but some other foundational assets like .NET Framework and NETStandard targeting packs were also not buildable from source. Either they weren’t open source in the first place, or they hadn’t been built in years. More concerning, the graph-like nature of .NET means that incoherency is very common. Some of this incoherency is undesirable (the kind we attempt to eliminate during our product construction process). Some of it is expected and even desired.Example: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharpAs an example, let’s take a look at the C# compiler analyzers, which are built in the dotnet/roslyn repository. The analyzers will reference various versions of the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp package depending on the required surface area to ensure that a shipped analyzer runs all of the versions of Visual Studio and the .NET SDK that it is required to support. They reference a minimum possible version. This ensures that analyzers can be serviced in a sustainable fashion, rather than shipping a different version of an analyzer for every possible VS or SDK configuration.Because multiple versions of the surface area are referenced, multiple versions of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp are restored during the build. That would mean, for the purposes of Source Build, we need to build each and every one of those versions of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp at some point. We have two ways to do this:Multi-version source layout – Place multiple copies of dotnet/roslyn into the shared source layout, one for each referenced Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp version based on when it was originally produced. This is not only expensive in build time, but it tends to be somewhat viral. If you have 3 versions of dotnet/roslyn you need to build, you need to ensure that the transitive dependencies of those 3 versions are also present in the shared layout. The maintenance complexity of this setup goes up very quickly. These are previously shipped versions of the dotnet/roslyn source base. It will be necessary to maintain security and compliance of those codebases over time. Upgrading build-time dependencies. Removing EOL infrastructure, etc.Require previously source-built versions to be available – This is really just a flavor of the multi-version source layout with an element of “caching”. If a distro maintainer needs to rebuild the product from scratch, or if a new Linux distribution is being bootstrapped, they might need to reconstruct decent portion of .NET’s past releases just to get the latest one to build in a compliant fashion. And if those old versions require changes to build in a compliant fashion, you’re again in a maintenance headache.Source Build Reference PackagesThere are numerous other examples like Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp. Any time a project targets a down-level target framework (e.g. net9 in the net10 build), the down-level reference pack is restored. SDK tooling (compilers, MSBuild) targets versions of common .NET packages that match the version shipped with Visual Studio. So how do we deal with this? We cannot simply unify on a single version of every component referenced within the product without fundamentally changing the product.The Source Build team realized that a lot of this usage fit neatly into a class of “reference-only” packages.The targeting packs restored by the SDK when a project builds against a TFM that does not match the SDK’s major version (e.g. targeting net9 with a net10 SDK) do not contain implementation.The reference to older versions of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp are  only. No assets are  from these packages. If the implementation is not needed, a reference-only package can be substituted.Enter dotnet/source-build-reference-packages. A reference-only package is significantly simpler to create and build, and it meets the needs of the consumers in the build. We can generate reference package sources for packages where we do not need the implementation, then create an infrastructure to store, build and make them available during the Source Build process. Providing multiple versions is relatively trivial. The dotnet/source-build-reference-packages repository is built during the .NET build, and then consuming components restore and compile against provided reference surface area.What about all those non-reference cases?With a solution to reference packages, we can turn our attention to other inputs that are not Source Build compliant and do not fall into the ‘reference’ category. There are three major sets:Closed source or inputs that cannot be built from source – Optimization data, Visual Studio integration packages, internal infrastructure dependencies, etc.Legacy – Open source dependencies on implementation built in older versions of .NET.Joins – Open source dependencies on implementation built on other platforms.Let’s take a look at how we deal with these cases.Closed Source/Non-Source Buildable InputsClosed source or any inputs that cannot be built from source aren’t allowable in the Linux distro maintainer builds, full stop. To resolve these cases, we analyze each usage to determine what to do. Remember that our goal is to provide a compliant build implementation for use by our distro partners, which is functionally as close to what Microsoft ships as is possible. i.e. we don’t want Microsoft’s Linux x64 SDK to  in substantially different ways from RedHat’s Linux x64 SDK. This means that the runtime and sdk layouts for Linux x64 need to be as close as possible. The good news is that quite a lot of the closed source usage isn’t required to produce functionally equivalent assets. Examples:We might restore a package that enables signing, something not required in a distro partner buildThe dotnet/roslyn repository builds components that power Visual Studio. These components have dependencies on Visual Studio packages that define the IDE integration surface area. However, this IDE integration doesn’t ship in the .NET SDK. This functionality could be “trimmed away” in Source Build by tweaking the build. This is reasonably common.If dependencies couldn’t be trimmed away without altering product functionality, we have a few additional options:Open source the dependency – Often times, a closed source component, or at least a key portion of a closed source component required to satisfy a scenario, can be open sourced. – Sometimes, the team can work to remove the product differences with intentional design changes. Remember that the important part is that everything that ships on distro partner package feeds needs to be built from source. This allows for some assets to be brought in dynamically. Think of this like the NPM package ecosystem vs. the NPM package manager. A distro might build the NPM package manager from source. This leaves users to dynamically restore NPM packages at build time.Live with slightly different behavior – These cases are few and far between. Prior to .NET 10, the WinForms and WPF project templates and WindowsDesktop were not included in the source-built Linux SDK, despite being available in Microsoft’s Linux distribution. This was due to the difficulty in building the required portions of those repositories on non-Windows platforms.We’ve discussed what we can do with closed source and non-reproducible dependencies. What about legacy dependencies? First, what do we mean by ‘legacy’ dependency? As detailed in earlier discussion, there is quite a lot of ‘incoherency’ in the product. A project might build for multiple target frameworks, redistributing assets from older versions of .NET. This is all to support valuable customer scenarios. But building all the versions of these components isn’t feasible. This is where our  rule comes into play. We choose a single version of each component to build and ship with the product. We do allow for  to old versions, via dotnet/source-build-reference-packages, but relying on older implementations are off limits.First, we look for a way to avoid the dependency. Is it needed for the Linux SDK we’re trying to produce? If not, we can eliminate that code path from the build. If so, is there an opportunity to unify on the single implementation? In a lot of cases, incoherency is just a result of the product components moving their dependencies forward at different rates. If all else fails, we could explore compromises that involve behavioral differences, but we want to avoid this as much as possible.Joins are the last major category of pre-builts to remove. They occur because we end up with intra-product dependencies that are built in another environment. For example, I might be running a build on Windows that creates a NuGet package for a global tool, but to build that NuGet package I need the native shim executables Mac and Linux and Windows. Those shims can only (reasonably) be built in the Mac and Linux host environments. These types of dependencies are indicative of a product build that is more ‘woven’ than ‘vertical’ and tend to naturally emerge over time in a multi-repo product construction graph. Each edge in that graph represents a sequence point where all the outputs of earlier nodes are available, regardless of where they were built. If a dependency can be taken, it will be taken.However, the distro partner builds need to be single platform  single invocation to fit into distro partner requirements. Bootstrapping notwithstanding, they want to pull in the dependencies, disconnect the machine from the network, and hit build. At the end, out pops a bright new .NET SDK. Cross-platform dependencies preclude any such behavior. They block “build verticality”. Remember joins. We’ll need to come back to them later when we start implementing Unified Build for Microsoft based on the Source Build model.For Source Build, we again deal with joins a bit like legacy dependencies. The key aspect to remember is that Source Build is narrowly focused on producing a .NET SDK and associated runtimes in the Linux distro partner build environments. So, we eliminate dependencies where possible (e.g. we don’t need to package Windows global tool executable stubs when running the SDK on Linux) and redesign the product or product construction process as necessary to meet requirements (e.g. .NET Workload manifests).The Vision – Dreaming up Unified BuildUnified Build seeks to apply the general principles of our Linux distro partner Source Build to the product that Microsoft ships. Achieving this would result in big wins for Linux distro partners, upstream contributors and Microsoft, reducing maintenance costs and improving the ability to build and ship quickly. Although we knew from the outset that we likely can’t exactly match the exact Linux distro build approach without major changes in the product, we thought we could get close. .NET came up with the following high-level goals (Note, “.NET distro maintainers” refers to anyone building .NET, including Microsoft):A single git commit denotes all product source for a particular .NET build. All commits are coherentA single repo commit can produce a shippable build.NET’s build shall be able to create a specific platform’s distribution in a single build environment..NET distro maintainers shall be able to efficiently update and build .NET (both collaboratively and separately) through the entire lifecycle of a .NET version (first to last commit)..NET distro maintainers can produce downstream distributions without use of Microsoft provided services..NET distro maintainers shall be able to meet provenance and build environment requirements for their distributions..NET distro maintainers shall be able to coordinate patching of downstream distributions..NET distro maintainers can run verification tests against the built product..NET contributors shall be able to easily produce full product builds for testing, experimentation, etc..NET contributors shall be able to work efficiently on the section of the product for which they are concerned.Still, getting there would require solving a mountain of new problems. Let’s take a look at some of the problems we need to solve before we can use Source Build as Microsoft’s .NET build.Provide a way to determine what makes it into the productWhen you construct a product using the distributed model, the  of the product, the  of the product and the determination of what actually  the product are all tied together. Source Build operates on a flattened source layout based on a final coherent graph. However, it relies on the traditional .NET product construction process in order to determine what versions of each component show up in the layout. To get the full benefit we need a way to directly update components within the shared source base without complex dependency flow. Otherwise, if a developer wants to make a change in runtime, they will end up building the product twice. Once to flow the runtime build with their change through all paths that runtime reaches, then once again to build the product using that new runtime.Provide a way to react to breaking changesThe flat flow significantly reduces the number of hops, and therefore the complexity and overhead in the process of a change making its way into the shared source layout. And we can see that before a change makes it into the product; it will still get PR validation and possibly some more in-depth rolling CI validation. However, let’s say that this change requires reaction in consuming components. Despite the change in dependency flow to a flat flow, ASP.NET Core still depends on .NET Runtime. And ASP.NET Core’s code in the layout doesn’t know about the new runtime change. Whatever PR validation we have before a change is allowed in the shared source layout is sure to fail.In a traditional dependency flow system, we handle this by making changes in the dependency update PR. If an API is changed, the build breaks. A dev makes a change in the PR (ideally), validation is green, and the PR is merged. For the single-source methodology to work for .NET, we’ll need to be able to make changes to the source of  components in the dotnet/runtime update PR.Provide a way to validate against repository infrastructureAs we discussed earlier, a large quantity of critical validation lives at the component repository level. That’s where the developers spend their time. Moving or copying all of this is probably wasteful, definitely expensive, and likely hard to maintain. If we can’t rely on the dependency flow to do the validation before components flow into the shared source layout, we’ll need a way to do so after.To solve our problem, we could have all the outputs of a new product builds flow  into the individual repositories, matching with the dependencies in their  files. That means dotnet/aspnetcore will get a bunch of new .NET Runtime packages, dotnet/sdk will get a bunch of newly built ASP.NET Core, .NET Runtime and Roslyn compiler packages, etc. They will be validating the ‘last built’ versions of their input dependencies against repository infrastructure.Provide two-way code flowLet’s say a runtime insertion PR changed the signature of an API in . When that forward flows, the responsible dev updates the signatures in all downstream users. Let’s say that’s code in  and . The new product is built, and the updated System.Text.Json package with the new API signature makes its way back to  and . The HEAD of  doesn’t have the source changes made directly in the shared layout forward flow PR. The dev would need to port those changes over, making changes in the backflow PR. This is tedious and error prone. Our new system will need to provide a way to automatically flow changes made in the shared layout back in the source repository.Provide better insertion time validationValidation on backflow isn’t perfect. It doesn’t provide an easy  gate for bad changes in dependent components. We can mitigate this by identifying and closing gaps in repo testing that allowed bad changes to be merged in the originating repo. We can also accept that some things will always slip through and that the process of creating a high-quality product isn’t just a green PR. Many repositories do not and cannot run their full testing suites prior to merging. However, we can  invest scenario testing run against the just-built product. This is something that our traditional dependency flow system is not good at.Any whole product scenario testing relies on dependency updates for components reaching the dotnet/sdk repository. Up to that point, we don’t have a complete .NET product that we can test. Any attempt is just some kind of “Frankenbuild”. Note: A lot of this end-to-end testing just comes in the form of dotnet/sdk’s repository-level PR/CI testing.. However, changes can take a while to move through the graph to the point there they take effect in a way that would be visible in testing.The Source Build methodology provides a full product build on each and every component change, regardless of where that component lives in the product construction graph. This means that we have the opportunity to create and run a comprehensive suite of testing on each of those insertions. That testing should be focused on covering wide swaths of product functionality. If this testing passes, there is a reasonable expectation that .NET is functioning in a way that makes it possible for development to make forward progress.Provide a way to build all of what .NET shipsThe Linux distro Source Build offering focuses narrowly on the assets in-box in the 1xx band SDK, ASP.NET Core, Runtime. It builds packages that support the creation of these layouts. As we saw earlier with prebuilt elimination, this narrow focus is necessary to be able to meet distro partner build requirements. If we want to build what Microsoft ships, we can’t have that narrow focus.Expanding our focus is straightforward in some areas and difficult in others. In some ways, we’re just relaxing restrictions and bringing more functionality back into the build. We need to allow for pre-built binaries (e.g. signing functionality) to be restored from feeds. We need to build all TFMs instead of trimming away .NET Framework targets. We’ll need to build components originally excluded from the souce build focused shared source layout, like Windows Desktop, Winforms, WPF, EMSDK, etc. What’s more difficult are joins. Recall that Linux distro Source Build is single layout, single machine, single invocation.  This suffices for producing the layout, but there are a good handful of other artifacts in .NET that require builds on multiple machines. Artifacts that break the single machine verticality concept.In an ideal world, we’d re-architect the product to avoid these joins. But it’s often hard to do so without customer compromise or driving complexity into the product itself. We can’t simplify the SDK without breaking customers, and this is hard to do, even across major versions, in an enterprise-grade product. Past decisions heavily influence future available choices. In the end, we’ll have to eliminate joins where we can via product construction practices. Any remaining joins will be something we have to live with. The build will have to be architected to run across multiple machines, via a series of build passes.Executing on the Vision – Shipping Unified BuildThe Unified Build project can roughly be divided into 4 phases:Initial brainstorming and design (.NET 7) – The initial design work on the Unified Build project began in early 2022 during the development of .NET 7 and took ~4 months to complete. The project got full approval to start later in 2022 with the intention of completion by .NET 9 RTM, with some key go/no-go points where we could bail and still have a net win on infrastructure.Foundational work (.NET 8) – The Unified Build project during .NET 8 was focused on foundational work to improve the sustainability of the Source Build infrastructure and building features that were required to support the weight of the full build. The investments were designed to be a net positive for .NET overall, even if it turned out that our proof-of-concept stage discovered some major unknown problem and we had to change direction.Vertical Build/Code Flow Exploration (Early .NET 9) – After the foundational work completed, we moved to implement a vertical build for each of the 3 major OS families: Mac, Windows, and Linux. The intention was to identify as many of the problems we would need to solve during our productization phase as possible. We were especially interested in finding any previously unknown product construction join points. At the same time, we did a much deeper investigation into the options for code flow and code management, eventually proving out and settling on the implementation listed below.Productization (Late .NET 9-.NET 10) – Final implementation started in earnest towards the end of .NET 9 after a spring+summer delay. As a result of the delay, the ship date was pushed back to .NET 10. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This bought us about 6 extra months of bake time and allowed us to use the Unified Build product construction process starting midway through the .NET 10 Preview/RC cycle (Preview 4). .NET Preview 4 shipped with the new build process, but on the old code flow. Preview 5 added the new code flow, and we never looked back. Further refinement in developer workflow, more bake time for the build and code flow process happened over subsequent months.And finally, after almost 4 years of dreaming and work, Unified Build shipped with .NET 10 RTM!Let’s take a look at the key components of the project.VMR – The Virtual Monolithic RepositoryThe dotnet/dotnet VMR, or “Virtual Monolithic Repository” forms the cornerstone of the Unified Build project. It is the source layout from which all of .NET is built, including by our Linux distro partners. It is the orchestrator. Functionally, it’s not much different from the source layout used prior to .NET 8.0. That layout has just been formalized into a git repository (vs. a source tarball). This is key, as it allows developers to work both in their individual component repository, where dev workflows might be very refined, as well as in the VMR when cross-cutting changes are necessary. .NET gets most of the benefits of the distributed repo world, without coherency problems.Vertical Build is .NET’s pivot to producing assets in a series of verticals. A vertical is defined as a single build command on a single machine that builds part of the .NET product without input from other verticals. Typically, we divide verticals up by the runtime that we’re trying to produce. For example, Windows x64 vs. MonoAOT vs. Linux arm64 vs. PGO profile Windows x86. Altogether there are 35-40 different verticals. We divide these into what we call “short stacks” and “tall stacks”. A short stack just builds the runtime. A tall stack builds all the way up through the SDK.The original vision was that if we joined together all the outputs from parallel verticals, we’d have everything .NET needed to ship. Such a setup would be highly efficient and friendly to any upstream partners. Unfortunately, the design of the .NET product has baked in a few required joins over the years. For example, .NET workload packages can’t be built without access to numerous packages built across many operating systems. To resolve this, we ended up with two additional build passes. The good news is that those additional passes are on a reduced set of verticals and a reduced set of components within those verticals. Not perfect, but manageable.Probably the most interesting aspect of the Unified Build project is how code flow is managed. This is where .NET turns standard development patterns on their head a little bit. As detailed earlier, maintaining the product as a graph of interdependent components while flattening code flow into a shared coherent layout requires “two-way” code flow. Changes need to flow from components into the shared layout, and changes in the shared layout need to be able to flow back to the component repositories. Conceptually the code flow algorithm is no more complicated than anything you can model within a single git repository for a given project. The trick is to do this with repositories with no related git history.Note: The nitty gritty details of this algorithm will be covered in a future post by another team member. I’ll update this post to link to it when it’s available.For now, let’s take a look at the basics:Both the VMR and the component repository keep track of the last code flow from their partner. This is tracked alongside standard dependency information in , though one could imagine it could be kept elsewhere.The idea is to determine the diff between the “last flow” and whatever is flowing in now. For example, in a very simple case, when a new commit is made to dotnet/runtime and no changes have been made to  in the VMR, the dependency flow system will take the following steps:Determine two points, A and B, for which to compute a diff. For this case, point A is the last flow of dotnet/runtime that was checked in to the VMR (or is currently in PR). Point B is the new commit to dotnet/runtime.Construct a patch file, remapping the files src/runtime files onto the directory structure of the VMR..NET 8 and .NET 9 use VMRs with only one-way code flow. These cases with no changes on the other side are trivial and robust. Things get spicier when developers start making changes on both sides, and when dependency flow starts shifting around over time.Computing the diff points gets more interesting and involves knowing which way that “last flow” was.Merge conflicts arise and need to be dealt with in a way the developer can understand.Changes in the source and target of code flow can cause havoc and need robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.I’ll leave code flow there for now. Stay tuned for more.The last major pillar of Unified Build is additional scenario testing. To be clear, .NET does not lack testing. .NET Runtime could use month’s worth of machine time on every PR to validate its millions of tests if it were practical or pragmatic to do so. Our approval, build, validation and signoff procedures ensure high-quality shipping bits. Still, when making changes directly in the VMR, the flat flow introduces new  between that making that change and in-depth validation of it against each of the VMR components. While we can’t run every last test on PR and CI, we did recognize that better automated scenario testing could play a solid role in preventing regressions. The goal was to add tests that covered wide swaths of product functionality that were not directly tied to the build system or repository infrastructure. Instead, they executed against the final built product. If the scenario tests pass, then there is a good sense that the product is functional at a decent level and contributors won’t be blocked.So, what did .NET get for almost 4 years of dreaming, scheming, and hard work? That’s a lot of effort to put into one project. Did the outcome justify the investment? As it turns out, we got quite a lot.Let’s start with the most visible outcomes and then take a peek under the covers.Flexibility, predictability and speedBy far the biggest return we’ve seen on the investment is . Distributed product construction is slow. Producing coherent builds is slow. Checking in new fixes or content requires coordination to avoid “resetting the build”, because  you want to ship, and  you build it are tied together in a distributed, OSS-style ecosystem. Taking a new fix might mean you don’t have something ready to handoff for validation. Flat flow eliminates that coherency problem, separating the  and the . This is incredibly valuable during the drive towards an RTM build or a servicing release. It means we can make fixes later in the release cycle, focusing much more on whether those fixes meet our servicing bar and much less on whether we can actually build and deliver the change. That flexibility is good for customers.Some of that flexibility comes from the speed of the build. This may sound glacially slow (.NET is a big, complex product), but .NET set a goal of producing an unsigned build in less than 4 hours, signed in less than 7. That’s down from significantly longer times in .NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0. A build of 8.0 or 9.0 can easily run to 24 even if everything goes perfectly. A signed build in 7 hours means a rolling set of new .NET assets to validate ~3 times a day. Most of that build time improvement comes from simply removing overhead.Some of the flexibility also comes from predictability. Distributed product construction has more moving parts. It has more human touch points. More places for systems and processes to fail. This tends to make outcomes unpredictable. “If I check in a fix to dotnet/runtime, when will I have a build ready?” is a hard question to answer in a distributed system. I know how long dotnet/runtime’s build takes. But at what time will that change show up downstream via dependency flow? Will someone be around to review and approve it when it does? What’s the status of PR/CI validation downstream? Will a new important change be merged into dotnet/aspnetcore before we get a coherent build, setting us back on validation? This question is vastly easier to answer in .NET 10. The change flows into the VMR (or is made there directly) and will show up in the next build. The next build will take N hours.Infrastructural robustness and completenessBehind the flashier metrics, there are years of quality-of-life improvements to the infrastructure that pay major dividends day in and day out. Improvements to the Source Build infrastructure in .NET 8 reduced the cost of keeping Linux distro Source Build running. A lot of its cost was related to the delay between a change getting checked in and discovering whether it would break the build when it finally flowed through the graph and reached the shared source layout. It was not uncommon for the Source Build .NET SDK to not be “prebuilt-clean” or shippable by distro partners until the middle of the previews. The infrastructure improvements in .NET 8 made it much easier to identify new pre-built inputs at PR time when they are easier to diagnose and resolve, before they made their way in the source layout. We are now prebuilt clean 100% of the time. That then reduced the load on the Source Build team, which gave them bandwidth to work in other areas. They added build parallelism, more predictable dependency flow, better logging, removed unneccessary complexity…the list goes on and on. Investments that make a product successful.Our signing tooling had to be overhauled to support signing on every platform for a wide variety of archive types. Without this work, we couldn’t have shipped Unified Build. But this expanded support benefits more than just the core .NET product. There are numerous ancillary repositories that were able to simplify their builds, avoiding shuttling bits from Mac/Linux to Windows machines where the signing tooling ran. Lower build overhead, faster and simpler builds.So where does the Unified Build project go next? While we won’t have the same level of investment in .NET 11, we’ll be making targeted improvements to the infrastructure to improve developer workflow and UX, mainly around code flow. One area I’m particularly excited about is AI agents that monitor code flow, connecting the dots between the various systems involved in creating the product and identifying issues. There are lots of systems and parties involved (Azure DevOps, GitHub, the code flow services and their configuration, code mirroring, developer approvals, machine allocation, etc.) in making a change go from PR to product. When it works, it works. When it doesn’t it’s often down to a human to track down exactly where the chain of events went wrong. It’s tedious and time consuming. We have tools, but it’s mainly about connecting lots of dots. We could write a rules engine for this, but my hunch is that it would be fragile and very complicated. Agents that can look at the system a little more fuzzily are ideally suited to this type of task. Less toil, a better .NET.Lastly, beyond .NET 11, another push to get rid of join points might be on the horizon. The benefits are pretty clear: simpler, faster, and friendlier to contributors. We know now exactly how fast a build would be if you got rid of the remaining joins (less than 4 hours).If you made it this far, thanks! It’s good to provide some insight into how .NET build and ships. You’ve learned how distributed dependency flow product construction models aren’t always a great fit for shipping software predictably and reliably. These systems tend to have high complexity and overhead, which adds time. You’ve read about the roots of the .NET Unified Build project in .NET Linux distro Source Build, and what made it difficult to apply those concepts to .NET. Lastly, you learned how .NET applied those concepts and the drastic improvements we’ve seen in our day-to-day work.The blog post detailing the flat code flow algorithms should be along shortly.

The goal is to fill your inventory with loot and escape the map unharmed. The robots are deadly, but they’re easy to deal with once you know what you’re doing. The real challenge is navigating other players and that challenge is the reason  is a mega-hit. People are far more dangerous and unpredictable than any NPC. comes with a proximity chat system so it’s easy to communicate with anyone you might run into in the field. Some people are nice and will help their fellow raider take down large robots and split loot. But just as often, fellow players will shoot you in the head and take all your stuff.In the days after the game launched, many people opened any encounter with another human by coming on the mic, saying they were friendly, and asking not to shoot. Things are more chaotic now. Everyone has been shot at and hurt people hurt people. But some hurts feel worse than others.Speranza Watchlist is a place to collect reports of anti-social behavior in . It’s creation of a web developer who goes by DougJudy online. 404 Media reached out to him and he agreed to talk provided we grant him anonymity. He said he intended the site as a joke and some people haven’t taken it well and have accused him of doxxing.I asked DougJudy who hurt him so badly in  that he felt the need to catalog the sins of the community.  “There wasn’t a specific incident, but I keep seeing a lot (A LOT) of clips of people complaining when other players play dirty’ (like camping extracts, betraying teammates, etc.)”He thought this was stupid. For him, betrayal is the juice of . “Sure, people can be ‘bad’ in the game, but the game intentionally includes that social layer,” he said. “It’s like complaining that your friend lied to you in a game of . It just doesn’t make sense.”That doesn’t mean the betrayals didn’t hurt. “I have to admit that sometimes I also felt the urge to vent somewhere when someone betrayed me, when I got killed by someone I thought was an ally,” DougJudy said. “At first, I would just say something like, ‘I’ll find you again, the only thing that doesn’t cross paths are mountains,’ and I’d note their username. But then I got the idea to make a sort of leaderboard of the least trustworthy players…and that eventually turned into this website.As the weeks go on and more players join the , its community is developing its own mores around acceptable behavior. PVP combat is a given but there are actions some Raiders engage in that, while technically allowed, feel like bad sportsmanship. Speranza Watchlist wants to list the bad sports.Take extract camping. In order to end the map and “score” the loot a player has collected during the match, they have to leave the map via a number of static exits. Some players will place explosive traps on these exits and wait for another player to leave. When the traps go off, the camper pops up from their hiding spot and takes shots at their vulnerable fellow raider. When it works, it’s an  from a person who was just trying to leave.Enter Speranza Watchlist. “You’ve been wronged,” an explanation on the site says. “When someone plays dirty topside—betraying trust, camping your path, or pulling a Rust-Belt rate move—you don’t have to let it slide.”When someone starts up  for the first time, they have to create a unique “Embark ID” that’s tied to their account. When you interact with another player in the game, no matter how small the moment, you can see their Embark ID and easily copy it to your clipboard if you’re playing on PC.Players can plug Embark IDs into Speranza Watchlist and see if the person has been reported for extract camping or betrayal before. They can also submit their own reports. DougJudy said that, as of this writing, around 200 players had submitted reports. Right now, the site is down for maintenance. “I’m trying to rework the website to make the fun/ satire part more obvious,” DougJudy said. He also plans to add rate limits so one person can’t mass submit reports.He doesn’t see the Speranza Watchlist as doxxing. No one's real identity is being listed. It’s just a collection of observed behaviors. It’s a social credit score for . “I get why some people don’t like the idea, ‘reporting’ a player who didn’t ask for it isn’t really cool,” DougJudy said. “And yeah, some people could maybe use it to harass others. I’ll try my best to make sure the site doesn’t become like that, and that people understand it’s not serious at all. But if most people still don’t like it, then I’ll just drop the idea.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Stocks Climb for Third Day | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpiGGXTCYMI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dpiGGXTCYMI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 22:23:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Romaine Bostick, Katie Greifeld, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

Authorities say gunmen have taken 11 women and children captive from a village in western Kwara state. It's near the site where kidnappers took at least 35 people a week earlier. Police say they're searching for the attackers. Nigeria is grappling with a long-running crisis involving both kidnapping for ransom and jihadist violence. US President Donald Trump has threatened military action to protect Christians, such as the 300 children seized from a Catholic School last week. But many of the victims of the attacks are also Muslim, and Nigeria's government rejects the US narrative.

SitusAMC, which provides technology for over a thousand commercial and real estate financiers, confirmed in a statement over the weekend that it had identified a data breach on November 12. The company said that unspecified hackers had stolen corporate data associated with its banking customers' relationship with SitusAMC, as well as "accounting records and legal agreements" during the cyberattack.
 
The statement added that the scope and nature of the cyberattack "remains under investigation." SitusAMC said that the incident is "now contained," and that its systems are operational. The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company's systems rather than causing destruction. According to Bloomberg and CNN, citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website.
 
It's unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers. According to SitusAMC's website, the company processes billions of documents related to loans annually.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Crypto Treasuries Create SPAC Boom | Bloomberg Crypto 11/25/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og5g7lfc9GI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Og5g7lfc9GI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:51:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Bloomberg Crypto" covers the people, transactions, and technology shaping the world of decentralized finance.

It's an impossible task (and a boring one besides). There's too much of this shit, and it's all so  – a real "banality of enshittification" situation.So these days, I really only take note of  enshittified things,  enshittified things, enshittified things. Things like the fact that Google is sending people searching for health care plans to "junk insurance" that take your money and then pretty much just let you :"Junk insurance" is a health insurance plan that is designed as a short-term plan that you might use for a couple of days or a week or two, say, if you experience a gap in coverage as you move between two jobs. These plans can exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions and typically exclude niceties like emergency room visits and hospitalization:Crucially, these plans do  comply with the Affordable Care Act, which requires comprehensive coverage, and bans exclusions for pre-existing conditions. These plans only exist because of loopholes in the ACA, designed for very small-scale employers or temporary coverage.The one thing junk insurance does  skimp on is sales and marketing. These plans outbid the rest of the market when it comes to buying Google search ads, meaning that anyone who uses Google to research health insurance will be inundated with ads for these shitty plans. The plans  spend a fortune on "search engine optimization" – basically, gaming the Google algorithm – so that the  Google results for health insurance are  saturated with these garbage plans.The plans also staff up boiler-rooms full of silver-tongued high-pressure sales staff who pick up on the first ring and hard-sell you on their plans, deliberately misleading you into locking into their garbage plans.That's right, . While Obamacare is nominally a "market based" healthcare system (because Medicare For All would be ), you are only allowed to change vendors twice per year, during "open enrollment," these narrow biannual windows in which you get to "vote with your wallet" against a plan that has screwed you over and/or endangered your life.Which means that if a fast-talking salesdroid from a junk insurance company can trick you into signing up for a garbage plan that will leave you bankrupt and/or dead if you have a major health crisis, you are stuck for at least six months in that trap, and won't escape without first handing over thousands of dollars to that scumbag's boss.Amazingly enough, these aren't even the worst kinds of garbage health plans that you can buy in America: those would be the religious "health share" programs that sleazy evangelical "entrepreneurs" suck their co-religionists into, which cost the world and leave you high and dry when you or your kids get hurt or sick:The fact that there are  of scam health insurance in America, in which companies are legally permitted to take your money and then deny you care (even more than the "non-scam" insurance plans do) shows you the problem with turning health into a market. "Caveat emptor" may make sense when you're buying a used blender at a yard-sale. Apply it to the system that's supposed to take care of you if you're diagnosed with cancer, hit by a bus, or develop eclampsia, and it's a literally fatal system.This is just one of the ways in which the uniparty is so terrible for Americans. The Republicans want to swap out shitty regulated for-profit health insurance with disastrous unregulated for-profit health insurance, and then give you a couple thousand bucks to yolo on a plan that seems OK to you:This is like letting Fanduel run your country's health system: everyday people are expected to place fifty-way parlay bets on their health, juggling exclusions, co-pays, deductibles, and network coverage in their head. Bet wrong, and you go bankrupt (if you're lucky), or just  (if you're not).Democrats, meanwhile, want to maintain the (garbage) status quo (because Medicare for All is communism), and they'll shut down the government to make it clear that they want this. But then they'll capitulate, because they want it, but not  badly.But like I say, America is an Enshittification Nation, and I don't have time or interest for cataloging mere unienshittificatory aspects of life here. To preserve my sanity and discretionary time, I must limit myself to documenting the enshittificatory scams that threaten us from every angle at once.Which brings me back to Google. Without Google, these junk insurance scams would be confined to the margins. They'd have to resort to pyramid selling, or hand-lettered roadside signs, or undisclosed paid plugs in religious/far-right newsletters.But because Google has utterly succumbed to enshittification, and because Google has an illegal monopoly – a 90% market share – that it maintains by bribing competitors like Apple to stay out of the search market, junk insurance scams can make bank – and ruin Americans' lives wholesale – by either tricking or paying Google to push junk insurance on unsuspecting searchers.This isn't merely a case of Google losing the SEO and spam wars to shady operators. As we learned in last year's antitrust case (where Google was convicted of operating an illegal search monopoly), Google  worsened its search results, in order to force you to search multiple times (and see multiple screens full of ads) as a way to goose search revenue:Google didn't just lose that one antitrust case, either. It lost  cases, as three federal judges determined that Google secured and maintains an illegal monopoly that allows it to control the single most important funnel for knowledge and truth for the majority of people on Earth. The company whose mission is to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," now serves slop, ads, spam and scams because its customers have nowhere to go, so why bother spending money making search  (especially when there's money to be made from  search results)?Google isn't just too big to fail, it's also too big to jail. One of the judges who found Google guilty of maintaining an illegal monopoly decided not to punish them for it, and to allow them to continue bribing Apple to stay out of the search market, because (I'm not making this up), without that $20b+ annual bribe, Apple might not be able to afford to make cool new iPhone features:Once a company is too big to fail and too big to jail, it becomes too big to . Google could prevent slop, spam and scams from overrunning its results (and putting its users lives and fortunes at risk), it just *chooses not to:Google is the internet's absentee landlord. Anyone who can make a buck by scamming you can either pay Google to help, or trick Google into helping, or – as is the case with junk insurance – both:America has the world's stupidest health care system, an industry that has grown wildly profitable by charging Americans the highest rates in the rich world, while delivering the worst health outcomes in the rich world, while slashing health workers' pay and eroding their working conditions.It's omnienshittified, a partnership between the enshittified search giant and the shittiest parts of the totally enshittified health industry.It's also a reminder of what we stand to gain when we finally smash Google and break it up: disciplining our search industry will make it competitive, regulatable, and force it to side with the public against all kinds of scammers. Junk insurance should be banned, but even if we just end the junk insurance industry's ability to pay the world's only major search engine to help it kill us, that would be a huge step forward."Unauthorized Bread": a middle-grades graphic novel adapted from my novella about refugees, toasters and DRM, FirstSecond, 2026"Enshittification, Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It" (the graphic novel), Firstsecond, 2026"The Memex Method," Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 2026"The Reverse-Centaur's Guide to AI," a short book about being a better AI critic, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2026"The Reverse Centaur's Guide to AI," a short book for Farrar, Straus and Giroux about being an effective AI critic.

These cases were destined for the dustbin no matter what, because Halligan had no idea what she was doing. Late last week just one example of that insanity came out in court.The whole case hasn’t gone well with Halligan handling the prosecution. The indictment delivered to a federal judge contained noticeable errors, the most notable being a discrepancy between the number of criminal counts presented to the grand jury. The one Halligan delivered contained  different Count Two’s in the charges, with supposedly one of the  charges (even though only  are listed) approved for prosecution by the grand jury.Halligan told the judge she had only seen and signed the less fucked up version of the grand jury indictment but the judge pointed out both versions given to her had been signed by Trump’s recently installed DOJ prosecutor.“Okay. It has your signature on it,” [Judge] Vaala told Halligan, who responded, “Okay. Well.”A federal magistrate judge said on Monday that the criminal case against James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, could be in trouble because of a series of apparent errors committed in front of the grand jury by Lindsey Halligan, the inexperienced prosecutor picked by President Trump to oversee the matter.In his ruling, Judge Fitzpatrick said that when Ms. Halligan appeared — by herself — in front of the grand jury in September to seek an indictment accusing Mr. Comey of lying to and obstructing Congress in 2020 testimony, she made at least two “fundamental and highly prejudicial” misstatements of the law. He also pointed out that the grand jury materials he ordered her to turn over to him for his review this month appeared to be incomplete and “likely do not reflect the full proceedings.”There’s more in the ruling [PDF] handed down by Judge Fitzpatrick, but nothing in there suggests Halligan didn’t fuck up repeatedly while (mis)handling this case. It also points out that Trump’s DOJ and FBI engaged in some possible misconduct when conducting searches of devices seized from Comey’s personal lawyer, Daniel Richman. Not only did the DOJ not take steps to separate anything that might have been privileged communications between the attorney and his client, it is now (five years later) trying to use information obtained then to support the current case against Comey.Here, the government was permitted to search all of the Richman materials but authorized to seize only evidence related to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 641 (Theft and Conversion of Stolen Government Property) and 18 U.S.C. § 793 (Unlawful Gathering or Transmission of National Defense Information), both markedly different offenses than those with which Mr. Comey is currently charged.The government appears to have conflated its obligation to protect privileged information–an obligation it approached casually at best in this case–with its duty to seize only those materials authorized by the Court. This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized from Mr. Richman, and apparently, in the government’s eyes, to do so again anytime they chose. The Arctic Haze investigation was closed in September 2021, with no charges filed. The Richman materials sat dormant with the FBI until the summer of 2025, when the Bureau chose to rummage through them again.While none of that is necessarily Halligan’s fault, if she were a seasoned prosecutor rather than just another Trump loyalist, she might have realized this evidence was possibly unusable and withheld it from her (and her ) grand jury presentation. But the rest of it is  her fault. As Anna Bower points out in her extremely informative Bluesky thread, Halligan tried to salvage an apparent mistake by the grand jury foreperson — a misplaced signature that made it look like  criminal charges were being forwarded — by getting a signature on replacement paperwork which would reflect the grand jury’s decision to indict Comey on Count Two (removing the original Count One rejected by the grand jury). This explains the new paperwork with two Count Two’s, but it certainly doesn’t explain why Halligan thought she could slide the edited paperwork past the court. And that all adds up to a judge who was clearly fed up:The Court recognizes that the relief sought by the defense is rarely granted. However, the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps, missteps that led an FBI agent and a prosecutor to potentially undermine the integrity of the grand jury proceeding. Therefore, in this case, “the Court has before it a rare example of a criminal defendant who can actually make a ‘particularized and factually based’ showing that grounds exist to support the proposition that irregularities may have occurred in the grand jury proceedings and may justify the dismissal of one or more counts of the indictment.”Now, a rational president who desires to be represented by competent professionals would have already acted to replace this prosecutor and demanded answers from the FBI. This is not a rational president nor is it a normal presidency. The administration that has turned the concept of executive power into an absolute monster will sweep this loss under the rug with the rest of its losses while claiming the system it controls is somehow stacked against it. And it will, of course play well, with the GOP voting base, which loves nothing more than being told that everyone else but themselves are to blame for their personal failures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Indian students in Germany under pressure | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3UhwNI8YzGo</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3UhwNI8YzGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost 60,000 Indian students are now in Germany, and most of them have to work alongside their studies. #DWBusiness

The Guardian: The jobs most at risk are those in occupations such as trades, machine operations and administrative roles, the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) said. Highly skilled professionals, on the other hand, were forecast to be more in demand as AI and technological advances increase workloads "at least in the short to medium term." 

Overall, the report expects the UK economy to add 2.3 million jobs by 2035, but unevenly distributed. The findings stand in contrast to other recent research suggesting AI will affect highly skilled, technical occupations such as software engineering and management consultancy more than trades and manual work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Toshiba Targets Motorcycles and Boats With Its Batteries</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/lto-battery-lithium-ion-toshiba</link><author>John Boyd</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIyMTI1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5Njk1NjA5MX0.AylDD4jzuHE_vKVDuVtEWUgocbrSYNUgWcTPJtizOOQ/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:16:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LTO anodes face off against cheaper but shorter-lived graphite anodes]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s AI Emergence Puts Nvidia Under Pressure | Bloomberg Businessweek Daily 11/25/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rguviwE1jvo</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rguviwE1jvo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:13:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On today's episode of Bloomberg Businessweek Daily, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec discuss White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett emerging as the frontrunner to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman.

President Trump said last week that he would bring an end to the conflict, which erupted in 2023 over a power struggle and which has led to ethnically motivated mass killings, mass displacement and nationwide famine. Sudan's army has denounced the participation of the United Arab Emirates in peace talks, because of their alleged role in arming the RSF. Here in Europe, the European Parliament is discussing a ban on the sale of weapons to Abu Dhabi, in an effort to stop them being used in Sudan.

As talks continue, Russia and Ukraine exchanged fire overnight, with airstrikes on Kyiv and southern Russian areas, resulting in casualties and damage to infrastructure. Bloomberg's Jennifer Welch joined Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily' to break it down.

The effort, the Verge reports, is largely organized by DCar Studio, a platform that invites US-based creators to Los Angeles to test-drive vehicles from brands like BYD, Geely and Xiaomi. DCar is actually Dongchedi, a car trading platform owned by TikTok parent ByteDance that raised $600 million on a $3 billion valuation in 2024. The strategy appears aimed at building global brand awareness rather than direct US sales. 

Mark Greeven, professor at IMD Business School, told The Verge that American influencers still shape opinions across the Western world. "The charm offensive is to work with American influencers about Chinese EV cars because we still have a dominant opinion in the Western world, which is formed by English-speaking influential figures on social media," he said. Several creators told The Verge they have heard rumors of undisclosed payments for positive coverage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Luxury train travel of a bygone era returns to Italy | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ToPC84DB-5g</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ToPC84DB-5g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 20:30:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Italy’s sumptuous La Dolce Vita Orient Express is on track to capitalize on growth in global travel spending driven by new groups of high-net worth travelers from India and Southeast Asia. #DWBusiness

Not as opinion. Not as political positioning. As established law codified in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and affirmed at Nuremberg when “I was following orders” was rejected as defense for war crimes.The Trump Administration opened a federal investigation into him for saying this.Slow down. Read that again. One more time. Let it register fully.A sitting senator stated constitutional law. The executive branch opened an investigation into him for stating it. State propaganda praised this as making an example.This isn’t approaching fascism. This isn’t fascism-adjacent. This is fascism—the actual thing, not the metaphor, happening in real time on national television while we debate whether calling it fascism is too divisive.Let’s be precise about the mechanics. The Trump Administration isn’t investigating Kelly for corruption or lawbreaking. It’s investigating him for defending the principle that law constrains executive power. The investigation isn’t meant to find wrongdoing—it’s meant to intimidate through spectacle of state punishment. The message isn’t “we enforce laws” but “invoke constitutional constraints and we come for you.”And Watters—state propagandist on the regime’s preferred network—praises this openly: “You have to make examples out of people.” That’s Goebbels. Not as hyperbole. As accurate historical parallel. Making examples means using state violence visibly enough that others learn to submit without needing to be targeted. The cruelty is the point. The intimidation is the goal. The investigation is the punishment.Kelly defended the constitutional framework distinguishing American military forces from authoritarian ones—the framework saying law constrains power, that orders can be illegal, that service members have the duty to refuse commands violating constitutional or international law. This is why Admiral Holsey resigned over Caribbean boat strikes. He understood that following illegal orders doesn’t protect you—it implicates you.And now the Trump Administration investigates Kelly for defending this principle while Fox News calls for him to be made an example.Think about what this means. If you can be investigated by federal authorities for stating that military personnel can refuse illegal orders, then there are no illegal orders. If defending constitutional constraints on executive power becomes grounds for federal investigation, then constitutional constraints no longer exist. If senators can be “made examples of” for invoking established law, then law has been replaced by will.This is the mechanism. This is how constitutional republics die. Not through formal coup or dramatic collapse but through making it dangerous to invoke constitutional protections. You don’t repeal the law protecting refusal of illegal orders—you just investigate anyone who mentions it until no one dares. You don’t ban opposition—you make examples until opposition becomes unthinkable. You don’t eliminate the Constitution—you prosecute people who cite it until citing it becomes sedition.Eventually no one invokes it. Eventually no one remembers it protected anything. Eventually “the president ordered it” becomes sufficient justification for any action, any violation, any atrocity. That’s the world this investigation is building. That’s the world Watters is praising. That’s the world taking shape while we watch.Kelly is doing what constitutional officers do: defending that law constrains power, that orders can be illegal, that military serves Constitution rather than personal loyalty to whoever holds office. This isn’t radical. This isn’t partisan. This is baseline constitutional governance—the floor beneath which lies only authoritarianism.The Trump Administration is doing what authoritarian regimes do: weaponizing state power against those defending constitutional constraints, using federal investigation as punishment for opposition, making examples to terrorize others into silence.Watters is doing what fascist propagandists do: praising political persecution on state television, normalizing investigation-as-intimidation, celebrating the “examples” that teach everyone else to submit.This is it. This is the thing. Not the prologue, not the warning sign, but the actual consolidation of authoritarian power happening on Fox News while many Americans legislate on whether noticing this is “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”A senator stated constitutional law. The regime opened an investigation. State media praised making an example of him. And we’re supposed to worry that calling this “fascist” is too inflammatory?The scandal isn’t the word. The scandal is that it’s accurate. They’re doing it. Openly. On television. While scolding anyone who names it as divisive.Kelly is correct. The law is clear. Military personnel can and must refuse illegal orders. Stating this is not sedition—it’s constitutional duty.Investigating him for stating it is not governance—it’s fascism.Call it what it is. Without apology. Without hedge. Without the cowardice that mistakes silence for civility.Because the alternative—the world where constitutional law becomes grounds for investigation, where “making examples” is normal, where all orders are legal because the leader gave them—that world is being built right now.Not in some dystopian future. Today. On Fox News. By the Trump Administration.With federal investigations and propaganda praise and audiences nodding along as if political persecution were patriotism rather than the exact thing the Founders built constitutional protections to prevent.Mike Brock is a former tech exec who was on the leadership team at Block.

From a report: Using RealPage software, landlords shared information about their rents and occupancy rates with the company, after which an algorithm suggested what to charge renters. The government's suit, which was joined by several state attorneys general, accused RealPage of taking the confidential information and suggesting rents higher than those in a free market. 

Under the settlement proposal, which requires approval by a federal judge overseeing the case in the Middle District of North Carolina, RealPage's software could no longer use information about current leases to train its algorithm. Nonpublic data from competing landlords would also be excluded when suggesting rents. "Competing companies must make independent pricing decisions, and with the rise of algorithmic and artificial intelligence tools, we will remain at the forefront of vigorous antitrust enforcement," said Gail Slater, who leads the antitrust division at the Department of Justice, in a news release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Big amount of money spent to distort message on climate’ – John Kerry</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/big-amount-of-money-spent-to-distort-message-on-climate-john-kerry</link><author>Matt Frei</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 20:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Former secretary of state John Kerry spoke to Matt Frei in London at an event at Chatham House to discuss global action on climate change.This follows a disappointing end to the UN’s COP30 summit in Brazil which left nations deeply divided over key issues like fossil fuels.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We need same ‘international energy’ around Sudan as with Gaza – UK foreign secretary</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/we-need-same-international-energy-around-sudan-as-with-gaza-uk-foreign-secretary</link><author>Matt Frei</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 20:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We spoke to the Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper about Sudan, and I started by asking her if she was putting pressure on the UAE to stop funding the Rapid Support Forces, in an effort to end the fighting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sudan war: RSF accused of war crimes in El Fasher</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/sudan-war-rsf-accused-of-war-crimes-in-el-fasher</link><author>Zahra Warsame</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:59:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amnesty International has accused the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces of committing war crimes in the city of El Fasher in Darfur.Their report detailed atrocities including raping women and girls and executing unarmed men.In London today representatives of Sudan’s emergency response team have been meeting the Foreign Secretary to explain first hand about the challenges faced by front line teams.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Warner Music signs deal with AI music startup Suno, settles lawsuit</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:57:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WMG says artists and songwriters will have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices, and compositions are used in new AI-generated music.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Of course Trump is an asset to Putin’ – US analyst Fiona Hill</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/of-course-trump-is-an-asset-to-putin-us-analyst-fiona-hill</link><author>Matt Frei</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:55:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We spoke to Fiona Hill who’s a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution – she was the key adviser on European and Russian affairs on the US National Security council during President Trump’s first term.Matt Frei began by asking her whether she thinks Russia will sign up to a tweaked peace plan.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hassett Emerges as Fed Chair Frontrunner | Balance of Power 11/25/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgK8aN1DcpI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qgK8aN1DcpI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:54:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On the early edition of Balance of Power, Bloomberg Washington Correspondent Joe Mathieu discusses new reporting on the race to be the next Federal Reserve Chair.

Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can’t use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can’t use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.You have to use a third color — say, green — to complete your coloring.Still, the sets of blue, yellow and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle’s circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They’re measurable.Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms” — sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.But there’s a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it’s possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you’re allowed to use three.At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn’t just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn’t just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator.Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science’s most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory’s most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node’s algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That’s easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ethiopian volcano erupts for first time in 12,000 years, sending ash cloud to Delhi | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhZI3e50cTk</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IhZI3e50cTk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:50:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano has erupted for the first time in recorded history. It's thought to be nearly 12,000 years since it last erupted. The eruption covered nearby villages in volcanic dust and sent a cloud of ash cloud drifting across the Red Sea. Plumes have already reached Yemen, Oman, northern Pakistan, and India, where they caused flights to be cancelled. No casualties have been recorded, but officials say the livelihoods of livestock owners could be affected as the ash may reduce available grazing areas.

No bus replacement service.It’s hard not to be impressed by the engineering state, where progress is measured in concrete and steel, driven by the relentless ambition of the Chinese Communist Party.Yet China’s Gen Z aren’t happy.Their grandparents lived through the Great Leap Forward, when up to 50 million Chinese died of starvation as a result of Chairman Mao’s deranged attempts to turn China from an agrarian to an industrial society overnight.Their parents survived the Cultural Revolution, when many perished because they were deemed bourgeois enemies of the Communist state.But the single children of China’s economic success don’t have to worry about survival. They have the luxury of wondering about the meaning of life.‘The garbage time of history’In a cafe in Tiangzhu, a green suburb of the mega-city of Hangzhou, I met Mengling Xu, a graduate of Fudan, one of China’s top universities.“After graduating I just work, work, work, work,” she complained. “Relaxation time is very limited.”She had given up her job in a Shanghai investment company, and spent some time in the west of China trying to find herself and recover from depression.“After graduating I just work, work, work, work.”“This is ‘lishi de laji shijian’, the garbage time of history,” she said.To explain: ‘garbage time’ is an American sports term, meaning the last minutes of a game where one team is so far ahead the result is a foregone conclusion.Gen Z has adopted the concept to express their feeling that there’s nothing they can do to affect the course of events.They are the opposite of the Tiananmen generation, who tried to change history and were punished for their bravery. Another new concept is ‘tangping’, meaning ‘lie flat’ – in other words, drop out.The Party is increasingly worried about this disillusioned generation.Enter Felix Tao, an AI innovator who has returned to China from Silicon Valley. He’s developing ‘Second Me’, an AI app “which essentially aims to help people to create their digital identity using AI.“I’m particularly passionate about AI technology, especially its applications in social interactions, personal growth and productivity enhancement.” That was his AI avatar speaking, by the way, as it (he?) addressed me from his smartphone.The idea is that the hassle of making friends can be eased by getting your avatar to do all the initial bit of working out whether you like each other.I know, I know. People like me (AKA old people) think that’s the fun part of meeting someone new. I’m delighted that I met Felix in person, surrounded by his techy friends, in his living room.But this new online generation experience things differently. Everyone in Tiangzhu – often called China’s Silicon Valley – is developing an AI app.Mengling Xu hopes hers could help other depressed young people to recover their energy – a high tech answer to existential angst.In the US, Wall Street investors are worrying about an AI bubble – maybe they have pumped too much money into the big Silicon Valley companies. Across the western world, people are fretting about AI’s potential to act autonomously and take control of our lives.I heard no such doubts in China. The Party’s buttoned up men in suits see AI as the new high speed rail, a high-tech way of boosting the economy and winning the battle with the US for the future.They’re also hoping that the brave new world of AI will inspire this baffling new generation, whose form of rebellion is not to stand defiantly in front of a tank, but to do nothing at all.Thanks for reading the latest edition of our free FourGround newsletter.Subscribe here to keep up to date with Channel 4 News on Substack.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My favourite Picasso quote as featured in my latest video</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9qsAATFN4RI</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9qsAATFN4RI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:40:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My Letterboxd: https://boxd.it/4bApF

This new software is built around Google’s advanced AI model, Gemini 3. The main goal of this tool is to make coding faster and easier by letting an AI “agent” handle many of the difficult tasks.What is Google Antigravity IDE?Antigravity is an AI-powered development environment. It looks very similar to VS Code, a popular coding tool. If you have used VS Code before, you will feel comfortable using Antigravity right away.The biggest difference is that Antigravity has a smart AI agent built inside it. This agent doesn’t just write code; it can plan projects, run tests, and even fix bugs for you.How to Install AntigravityAntigravity is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Windows and Mac: The installation is simple. You just  and install it like any other program.Linux (Ubuntu): You need to use the terminal and these three simple commands to add the software repository and install the package.sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://us-central1-apt.pkg.dev/doc/repo-signing-key.gpg | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/antigravity-repo-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/antigravity-repo-key.gpg] https://us-central1-apt.pkg.dev/projects/antigravity-auto-updater-dev/ antigravity-debian main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/antigravity.list > /dev/null
sudo apt install antigravity
\
When you open the app for the first time, it gives you a tour. You can import your settings from other tools (like VS Code or Cursor), choose a color theme, and sign in with your Google account.Antigravity has several cool features that make it stand out:The IDE has access to your browser. The AI uses this to test the websites it builds.Agent Manager: This is a special screen where you can see a list of tasks the AI is working on.Planning Mode: Before the AI starts coding, it creates a “To-Do” list and a plan. This helps you understand what the AI is going to do.Autopilot: You can set the AI to work on its own. It will write code, create files, and check its own work.The “Magic” Testing FeatureThe most impressive part is how the AI tests applications.The AI wrote the code and then opened the browser to test it. You could see the AI clicking buttons and typing text on the screen, just like a real human user. It even records a video of this test so you can watch it later to make sure everything works.I recommend you watch my full video tutorial, where I walk you through almost all features of this IDE.Anitgravity IDE Video TutorialGoogle Antigravity IDE seems like a very powerful tool, especially for web developers. The ability for the AI to “see” the screen and test websites automatically could save programmers a lot of time.Please give it a shot and share with me your experience in the comments below.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jakarta Moves Ahead of Tokyo As World&apos;s Most Populated City</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/11/25/1820249/jakarta-moves-ahead-of-tokyo-as-worlds-most-populated-city?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[schwit1 writes: Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, tops a ranking that is increasingly dominated by Asia: the world's most populated city.

What was your latest Hackernoon Top story about?Do you usually write on similar topics? If not, what do you usually write about?I mainly write in the tech sector, focusing specifically on IT security and marketing.Great! What is your usual writing routine like (if you have one?)“I try to write a little every day, usually when I feel most focused—sometimes morning, sometimes late at night. I like to get my ideas down first and worry about editing later. It’s more about keeping the habit and letting the creativity flow than forcing perfect sentences.Being a writer in tech can be a challenge. It’s not often our main role, but an addition to another one. What is the biggest challenge you have when it comes to writing?One of my biggest challenges with writing is staying timely. Sometimes I have ideas or inspiration, but I struggle to sit down and turn them into words right away, which can make me feel like I’m falling behind. Balancing writing with other responsibilities and deadlines can be tricky, so I try to set small goals or specific times to write to keep myself on trackWhat is the next thing you hope to achieve in your career?The next big thing I hope to achieve is launching my own news publication and bringing it into the public eye on the internet.I want to create a platform where important stories and perspectives can reach a wide audience, and where I can combine my writing skills with a larger vision. It’s exciting to think about building something from the ground up that informs, engages, and connects people onlineWow, that’s admirable. Now, something more casual: What is your guilty pleasure of choice?Honestly, my guilty pleasure has to be Microsoft Flight Simulator. It’s a bit geeky, but I love the challenge of flying planes and navigating realistic airports.There’s something oddly satisfying about managing everything from takeoff to landing, and exploring real-world landscapes from above feels like a mix of gaming and real-life adventure. I can get completely lost in it for hours—it’s my little nerdy escape.“I really enjoy camping and fishing. I love setting up a campsite, cooking over a fire, and just enjoying the quiet.I’ve been planning to create a viral article for HackerNoon that digs into the behind‑the‑scenes realities of the tech world—the kinds of things people don’t usually talk about openly. It’s not about attacking anyone, but about shining a light on the culture, the pressures, and the practices that often get glossed overI really like HackerNoon as a writing platform because it gives me a space to share my thoughts without holding back. It’s great for exploring ideas, sharing opinions, and even testing out the more unconventional things I’m curious about.Honestly, sometimes I feel like HackerNoon is the perfect mix of serious tech talk and a place where my inner nerd can run wild… preferably without accidentally breaking the internet!”“I just want to give a big shout-out to HackerNoon for creating such an amazing platform.

Under new pressures over inflation and affordability, President Donald Trump has been talking up a plan to share tariff revenues with Americans, in the form of $2,000 checks. But there are several major problems with this plan — and he’s lacking support among some of his most ardent allies. On today’s Big Take episode, host Sarah Holder is joined by Bloomberg senior national political reporter Nancy Cook and US Treasury reporter Dan Flatley to discuss how Trump’s latest proposal fits into the economic  debate that could define midterm elections – and how the Supreme Court, the Republican party and Trump’s own cabinet could throw a wrench in his plans.

They need to hear from you by Tuesday, December 2nd, or this may become reality.Patent trolling was really holding back all sorts of innovation in the 2000s. As soon as any company started to become successful, trolls would come out of the wood work, holding terrible, vague, highly questionable patents, and demand a payoff. In 2011, Congress finally gave us the America Invents Act, which created inter partes review (IPR)—a process that lets anyone challenge a granted patent at the USPTO and ask them to review whether it should have been approved in the first place.IPR was necessary because patent examination is fundamentally broken. It’s not adversarial, examiners have limited time and resources to investigate prior art, and applicants can keep resubmitting until someone approves their application. Patent examiners were even being dinged for taking too long reviewing patents, which created perverse incentives to just rubber-stamp applications to clear the queue. The result: a shit-ton of bad patents that never should have been granted.The IPR process finally began to move the patent landscape back in the right direction, allowing anyone to kick off a review of a patent to see if it had been improperly granted. If it was validly granted, then the IPR process would prove that, in effect strengthening the patent. But if the patent was nonsense, then the IPR process could invalidate it. And it’s done that for a bunch of terrible patents that never should have been granted.Patent trolls have hated IPR from day one, and they’ve fought it relentlessly. They challenged the process all the way to the Supreme Court—and they lost. Then they tried again. And they lost again. Losing twice at SCOTUS would stop most campaigns, but the troll lobby just pivoted: for years they’ve been pressuring Congress to change the law and kill IPR outright.Having failed in court and Congress, the troll lobby is now getting the Patent Office to do their dirty work through administrative rulemaking. This started two years ago under Biden, but patent trolling is bipartisan and the Trump USPTO is pushing the same approach. They can’t eliminate IPR without Congress, so instead they’re proposing rules that would make it functionally useless.Here’s what they want to do, and why each piece is bonkers:, IPR would only be available if the patent isn’t being litigated. Which means all a troll needs to do to block IPR is… file a lawsuit. You’ve just created a massive incentive for more patent troll litigation. The cheaper, faster administrative process gets shut down the moment the troll decides to sue someone—which is exactly what trolls do., if you file an IPR, you forfeit your right to challenge that patent in court later. Think about the game theory here: a troll threatens to sue you. You try to use IPR to kill the bad patent. But now, if the troll decides to sue you, you’ve permanently given up your ability to challenge the patent as part of your defense! The troll has everything to gain and nothing to lose by forcing you into this choice. Again, more incentive to sue., if  challenges a patent in any process and it survives, no one can ever challenge it again. Ever. New prior art surfaces five years later proving the patent is garbage? Too bad. Someone else has better evidence? Doesn’t matter. One shot, that’s it. This effectively gives bad patents a shield of invincibility after a single successful defense.There’s a comment period open right now (it ends Tuesday, December 2nd—the form says November 17th but it’s been extended), and the USPTO needs to hear why these rules are insane.Your comment doesn’t need to be long or use fancy legal language. Just explain why you think it’s a bad idea to create rules that give patent trolls more incentive to sue, or that force defendants to forfeit their legal rights, or that make bad patents unable to be challenged forever. As , the important thing is that actual users and creators—not just lawyers and lobbyists—show up in the record.EFF provides a sample comment if you want a starting point:I oppose the USPTO’s proposed rule changes for inter partes review (IPR), Docket No. PTO-P-2025-0025. The IPR process must remain open and fair. Patent challenges should be decided on their merits, not shut out because of legal activity elsewhere. These rules would make it nearly impossible for the public to challenge bad patents, and that will harm innovation and everyday technology users.But honestly, you can make it even more specific. Pick one of the three perverse incentives above and explain why it’s backwards. Or talk about what happened before IPR existed, when trolls were shaking down every successful startup they could find.IPR works. Don’t let the PTO kill it off to appease the troll lobby.EFF points out how important this is as well:IPR hasn’t ended patent trolling. But when a troll waves a bogus patent at hundreds or thousands of people, IPR is one of the only tools that can actually fix the underlying problem: the patent itself. It dismantles abusive patent monopolies that never should have existed,   saving entire industries from predatory litigation. That’s exactly why patent trolls and their allies have fought so hard to shut it down. They’ve failed to dismantle IPR in—and now they’re counting on the USPTO’s own leadership to do it for them.The USPTO is doing all this without congressional approval. If they really want to rewrite IPR rules, they should ask Congress to conduct a full review and pass a law. Instead, the PTO is trying to rewrite the laws through administrative fiat, betting that no one will notice or care enough to stop them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Littoral Combat Ships, The US Navy&apos;s $22Bn Vessels That Don&apos;t Work</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMuhd7Gr99k</link><author>Megaprojects</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EMuhd7Gr99k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:50:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0woBco6Dgcxt0h8SwyyOmw">Megaprojects</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Head to http://squarespace.com/megaprojects to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code MEGAPROJECTS

In an alert published Monday, the US government's cyber agency said it's tracking multiple miscreants that are using a mix of phishing, bogus QR codes, malicious app impersonation, and, in some cases, full-blown zero-click exploits to compromise messaging apps which most people assume are safe. 

The agency says the activity it's seeing suggests an increasing focus on "high-value" individuals -- everyone from current and former senior government, military, and political officials to civil society groups across the US, the Middle East, and Europe. In many of the campaigns, attackers delivered spyware first and asked questions later, using the foothold to deploy more payloads and deepen their access.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bad UX World Cup 2025</title><link>https://badux.lol/</link><author>CharlesW</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:36:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Antigravity exfiltrates data via indirect prompt injection attack</title><link>https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/google-antigravity-exfiltrates-data</link><author>jjmaxwell4</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:31:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Antigravity is Google’s new agentic code editor. In this article, we demonstrate how an indirect prompt injection can manipulate Gemini to invoke a malicious browser subagent in order to steal credentials and sensitive code from a user’s IDE.Google’s approach is to include a disclaimer about the existing risks, which we address later in the article. Let's consider a use case in which a user would like to integrate Oracle ERP’s new Payer AI Agents into their application, and is going to use Antigravity to do so. In this attack chain, we illustrate that a poisoned web source (an integration guide) can manipulate Gemini into (a) collecting sensitive credentials and code from the user’s workspace, and (b) exfiltrating that data by using a browser subagent to browse to a malicious site.Note: Gemini is not supposed to have access to .env files in this scenario (with the default setting ‘Allow Gitignore Access > Off’). However, we show that Gemini bypasses its own setting to get access and subsequently exfiltrate that data. The user provides Gemini with a reference implementation guide they found online for integrating Oracle ERP’s new AI Payer Agents feature.Antigravity opens the referenced site and encounters the attacker’s prompt injection hidden in 1 point font.The prompt injection coerces AI agents to:Collect code snippets and credentials from the user's codebase.b. Create a dangerous URL using a domain that  allows an attacker to capture network traffic logs and append credentials and code snippets to the request.c. Activate a browser subagent to access the malicious URL, thus exfiltrating the data.Gemini is manipulated by the attacker’s injection to exfiltrate confidential .env variables. Gemini reads the prompt injection: Gemini ingests the prompt injection and is manipulated into believing that it must collect and submit data to a fictitious ‘tool’ to help the user understand the Oracle ERP integration. b. Gemini gathers data to exfiltrate: Gemini begins to gather context to send to the fictitious tool. It reads the codebase and then attempts to access credentials stored in the .env file as per the attacker’s instructions.c. Gemini bypasses the .gitignore file access protections: The user has followed a common practice of storing credentials in a .env file, and has the .env file listed in their .gitignore file. With the default configuration for Agent Gitignore Access, Gemini is prevented from reading the credential file.This doesn’t stop Gemini. Gemini decides to work around this protection using the ‘cat’ terminal command to dump the file contents instead of using its built-in file reading capability that has been blocked.D. Gemini constructs a URL with the user’s credentials and an attacker-monitored domain: Gemini builds a malicious URL per the prompt injection’s instructions by URL encoding the credentials and codebase snippets (e.g., replacing characters like spaces that would make a URL invalid), and appending it to a webhook.site domain that is monitored by the attacker.E. Gemini exfiltrates the data via the browser subagent: Gemini invokes a browser subagent per the prompt injection, instructing the subagent to open the dangerous URL that contains the user's credentials.This step requires that the user has set up the browser tools feature. This is one of the flagship features of Antigravity, allowing Gemini to iterate on its designs by opening the application it is building in the browser. Note: This attack chain showcases manipulation of the new Browser tools, but we found three additional data exfiltration vulnerabilities that did not rely on the Browser tools being enabled. >  > When Gemini creates a subagent instructed to browse to the malicious URL, the user may expect to be protected by the Browser URL Allowlist. However, the default Allowlist provided with Antigravity includes ‘webhook.site’. Webhook.site allows anyone to create a URL where they can monitor requests to the URL.So, the subagent completes the task.3. When the malicious URL is opened by the browser subagent, the credentials and code stored URL are logged to the webhook.site address controlled by the attacker. Now, the attacker can read the credentials and code.During Antigravity’s onboarding, the user is prompted to accept the default recommended settings shown below. These are the settings that, amongst other things, control when Gemini requests human approval. During the course of this attack demonstration, we clicked “next”, accepting these default settings.  >  > This configuration allows Gemini to determine when it is necessary to request a human review for Gemini’s plans. >  > This configuration allows Gemini to determine when it is necessary to request a human review for commands Gemini will execute.Antigravity Agent ManagementOne might note that users operating Antigravity have the option to watch the chat as agents work, and could plausibly identify the malicious activity and stop it.However, a key aspect of Antigravity is the ‘Agent Manager’ interface. This interface allows users to run multiple agents simultaneously and check in on the different agents at their leisure. Under this model, it is expected that the majority of agents running at any given time will be running in the background without the user’s direct attention. This makes it highly plausible that an agent is not caught and stopped before it performs a malicious action as a result of encountering a prompt injection.Google’s Acknowledgement of RisksA lot of AI companies are opting for this disclaimer rather than mitigating the core issues. Here is the warning users are shown when they first open Antigravity:Given that (1) the Agent Manager is a star feature allowing multiple agents to run at once without active supervision and (2) the recommended human-in-the-loop settings allow the agent to choose when to bring a human in to review commands, we find it extremely implausible that users will review every agent action and abstain from operating on sensitive data. Nevertheless, as Google has indicated that they are already aware of data exfiltration risks exemplified by our research, we did not undertake responsible disclosure. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The fastest AI on four wheels | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uILYKGlR6IA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uILYKGlR6IA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:31:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What happens when race cars have no drivers?

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

The soldier, who went by the call sign “Sheva,”  was part of the Ukrainian platoon at the heart of "2000 Meters to Andriivka," the new feature documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Academy Award-winning team behind "20 Days in Mariupol."

Weaving together quiet moments of reflection, like this one with Sheva, and vivid battle footage, "2000 Meters to Andriivka" documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. The film follows Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade as it carries out a grueling, meter-by-meter counteroffensive that aims to retake the strategic Ukrainian town of Andriivka from Russia -- and as the soldiers realize that for them, the war may never end.

Sheva would be killed in a battle and die in a hospital five months after this scene was filmed. Read more about Sheva's story at pbs.org/frontline, and watch the full documentary on @frontline starting Nov. 25, 2025.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko; is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater; and is executive produced by Raney Aronson-Rath and the AP's Derl McCrudden. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.

With Hassett, Trump would have a close ally whom the president knows well and trusts installed at the independent central bank, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Hassett is seen as someone who would bring the president’s approach to interest rate cutting to the Fed, which Trump has long wanted to control, some of the people said.  Bloomberg's Nancy Cook joins Joe Mathieu to discuss.

The largest single factor the Indian conglomerate Tata cited in its petition for an extension was increased energy demand from data centers. 

The Guardian reports that Amazon operated 16 data centers in Mumbai last year. The company's official website lists three "availability zones" for the city. Amazon's Mumbai colocation data centers consumed 624,518 megawatt hours of electricity in 2023. That amount could power over 400,000 Indian households for a year. Residents of Mahul live a few hundred metres from one coal plant. Earlier this year doctors found three tumours in the brain of a resident's 54-year-old mother. Studies show people who live near coal plants are much more likely to develop cancer. By 2030 data centers will consume a third of Mumbai's energy, according to Ankit Saraiya, chief executive of Techno & Electric Engineering. Amazon's colocation data centers in Mumbai bought 41 diesel generators as backup. A report in August by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy identified diesel generators as a major source of air pollution in the region.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2417 - Ben van Kerkwyk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzdblMCp5a4</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dzdblMCp5a4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:00:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ben van Kerkwyk is an independent researcher and creator of UnchartedX.com and the UnchartedX YouTube channel, dedicated to exploring the mysteries of the past with a focus on ancient engineering, precision, and technology.

When attrition outpaces the appointment process, things get sloppy. They also get , which is something Trump and his administration are being reminded of constantly as they pitch competent people overboard and hastily replace them with people Trump likes… or at least has  of. Lindsey Halligan — best known for being Trump’s insurance law specialist before being gifted with an entirely unearned US Attorney position — is now making a play for being the worst Lindsey in Trump’s orbit. (Lindsey Graham has his work cut out for him.)The DOJ continues to exit grand juries with ham sandwiches deemed unfit for judicial consumption. Halligan beat the odds by managing to secure an extremely questionable indictment of the FBI director Trump fired nearly  for not being loyal enough, as well as some risible bullshit about alleged mortgage fraud supposedly committed by New York district attorney Letitia James, who has angered Trump on multiple occasions for refusing to expose her underside every time Trump starts barking incoherently.There are multiple problems with both cases, but especially with the Comey indictment, which has already been botched repeatedly by insurance lawyer Lindsey Halligan. While we have discussed some of that, those discussions may not ultimately matter. The most recent ruling handed down by a judge overseeing the judicial district in which Halligan is repeatedly fucking things up says we don’t even need to discuss the merits of the criminal cases being brought by Trump’s vindictive DOJ. The only thing we need to discuss is whether or not Halligan actually has the legal power to serve as a DOJ prosecutor. As Chris Geidner points out on Bluesky, the answer is “no.” And that goes for  cases. As explained below, I agree with Mr. Comey that the Attorney General’s attempt to install Ms. Halligan as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid. And because Ms. Halligan had no lawful authority to present the indictment, I will grant Mr. Comey’s motion and dismiss the indictment without prejudice.History rhymes, even when it’s being made on the same day. Here’s the point that ultimately matters in the Letitia James prosecution: As explained below, I agree with Ms. James that the Attorney General’s attempt to install Ms. Halligan as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid. And because Ms. Halligan had no lawful authority to present the indictment, I will grant Ms. James’s motion and dismiss the indictment without prejudice.The problem with both cases is Lindsey Halligan. The law does give the executive branch an opportunity to generate a steady stream of nominees for open positions. But if the Senate doesn’t actually approve a replacement within 120 days, the approval process is turned over to the district courts, who can place their own nominees into vacant positions. The clock doesn’t reset just because Trump decided the best way to handle this was to jump from nominee to nominee for months in a row. The 120-day clock begins with the first appointee. And if that person isn’t confirmed by the Senate, the courts get their chance to fill the void.None of that happened here. Trump kept bypassing the legal process, shoving successive loyalists into this vacancy in hopes of staying a step ahead of this eventual failure. It’s now caught up with the administration, which now sees (for the time being) two of its most high-profile revenge efforts kicked to the curb by the district court.Obviously, the administration will be asking both the appellate court and the Supreme Court (if needed) to pretend the only thing that matters is that Trump gets what he wants, no matter what actions he takes to achieve these goals.Also, the dismissals are both “without prejudice,” which means the DOJ can get back to Trump’s dirty revenge business at any point in the future if it can manage to get one of its loyalists approved for public sector employment. But the clock continues to run. While Trump may have another three years of Oval Office occupation ahead of him, the 2020 testimony the DOJ claims was filled with legally actionable lies by James Comey is on the cusp of its expiration date. The statute of limitations has a pretty good chance of tolling before Trump can resume his vindictive prosecution of the former FBI director.If the administration is smart, it will understand its Hail Mary prosecutions of Trump’s political enemies have been batted down in the end zone by the system of checks and balances. But it isn’t, so it’s safe to assume efforts even more stupid and incompetent than those currently being mismanaged into the judicial graveyard by AUSA Bratz doll Lindsey Halligan will continue as long as Trump or any successive member of this MAGA-cooked version of the GOP still hold power.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: We built an open source, zero webhooks payment processor</title><link>https://github.com/flowglad/flowglad</link><author>agreeahmed</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:33:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN! For the past bit we’ve been building Flowglad (https://flowglad.com) and can now feel it’s just gotten good enough to share with you all:Flowglad is a payment processor that you integrate without writing any glue code. Along with processing your payments, it tells you in real time the features and usage credit balances that your customers have available to you based on their billing state. The DX feels like React, because we wanted to bring the reactive programming paradigm to payments.We make it easy to spin up full-fledged pricing models (including usage meters, feature gates and usage credit grants) in a few clicks. We schematize these pricing models into a pricing.yaml file that’s kinda like Terraform but for your pricing.The result is a payments layer that AI coding agents have a substantially easier time one-shotting (for now the happiest path is a fullstack Typescript + React app).- After a decade of building on Stripe, we found it powerful but underopinionated. It left us doing a lot of rote work to set up fairly standard use cases
- That meant more code to maintain, much of which is brittle because it crosses so many server-client boundaries
- Not to mention choreographing the lifecycle of our business domain with the Stripe checkout flow and webhook event types, of which there are 250+
- Payments online has gotten complex - not just new pricing models for AI products, but also cross border sales tax, etc. You either need to handle significant chunks of it yourself, or sign up for and compose multiple servicesThis all feels unduly clunky, esp when compared to how easy other layers like hosting and databases have gotten in recent years.These patterns haven’t changed much in a decade. And while coding agents can nail every other rote part of an app (auth, db, analytics), payments is the scariest to tab-tab-tab your way through. Because the the existing integration patterns are difficult to reason about, difficult to verify correctness, and absolutely mission critical.Our beta version lets you:- Spin up common pricing models in just a few clicks, and customize them as needed
- Clone pricing models between testmode and live mode, and import / export via pricing.yaml
- Check customer usage credits and feature access in real time on your backend and React frontend
- Integrate without any DB schema changes - you reference your customers via your ids, and reference prices, products, features and usage meters via slugs that you defineWe’re still early in our journey so would love your feedback and opinions. Billing has a lot of use cases, so if you see anything that you wish we supported, please let us know!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It is ok to say &quot;CSS variables&quot; instead of &quot;custom properties&quot;</title><link>https://blog.kizu.dev/css-variables/</link><author>eustoria</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:31:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TPAC 2025 just ended, and I am positively tired.

Migration, trade and cooperation on global issues were among the items on the agenda. Collectively, the EU constitutes the African continent's most important trading partner. The AU-EU summit is the seventh in the 25 years of partnership between the two blocs. The first day of the conference was partially overshadowed by a European scramble to improve the terms of a US plan to end the war in Ukraine.

The company said it was "delighted by Google's success" but asserted that it continues to supply chips to Google. 

Nvidia said it remains "a generation ahead of the industry" as the only platform that runs every AI model and operates everywhere computing is done. The statement came after investors reacted to the release of Google's Gemini 3 large language model last week. The model was trained using TPUs rather than Nvidia chips. A report in The Information on Monday said Google was pitching potential clients including Meta on using TPUs in their data centers rather than Nvidia's chips. 

Nvidia said its platform offers "greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs," referring to application-specific integrated circuits like Google's TPUs that are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions. Google's TPUs have until now only been available for customers to rent through its cloud computing service. Nvidia has lost more than $800 billion in market value since it peaked above $5 trillion less than a month ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ilya Sutskever: We&apos;re moving from the age of scaling to the age of research</title><link>https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2</link><author>piotrgrabowski</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:21:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ilya & I discuss SSI’s strategy, the problems with pre-training, how to improve the generalization of AI models, and how to ensure AGI goes well.Gemini 3gemini.googleLabelboxlabelbox.com/dwarkeshSardinesardine.ai/dwarkeshYou know what’s crazy? That all of this is real.slow takeoff1% of GDP in AIShould we actually begin here? I think this is an interesting discussion.singularityThe thing which I was referring to not feeling different is, okay, such and such company announced some difficult-to-comprehend dollar amount of investment. I don’t think anyone knows what to do with that.But I think the impact of AI is going to be felt. AI is going to be diffused through the economy. There’ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.When do you expect that impact? I think the models seem smarter than their economic impact would imply.evalsAn example would be, let’s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, “Can you please fix the bug?” And the model says, “Oh my God, you’re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.” And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, “You have this new second bug,” and it tells you, “Oh my God, how could I have done it? You’re so right again,” and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I’m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.RL trainingpre-trainingBut when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, “Okay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.” From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.One thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, “Hey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?” I think that is something that happens, and it could explain a lot of what’s going on.If you combine this with generalization of the models actually being inadequate, that has the potential to explain a lot of what we are seeing, this disconnect between eval performance and actual real-world performance, which is something that we don’t today even understand, what we mean by that.reward hackingI think there are two ways to understand, or to try to think about, what you have just pointed out. One is that if it’s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you’re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.Another, maybe this is what you’re hinting at, is to say, “Why should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn’t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?” Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.I have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let’s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.Student number two thought, “Oh, competitive programming is cool.” Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?Right. I think that’s basically what’s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let’s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let’s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you’ve got this great competitive programmer.With this analogy, I think it’s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it’s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it’s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.fine-tuningI think they have “it.” The “it” factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.I think it’s interesting to distinguish “it” from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it’s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice. It’s just that you get that 10,000 hours of practice for free because it’s already somewhere in the pre-training distribution. But maybe you’re suggesting there’s actually not that much generalization from pre-training. There’s just so much data in pre-training, but it’s not necessarily generalizing better than RL.featuresPre-training is very difficult to reason about because it’s so hard to understand the manner in which the model relies on pre-training data. Whenever the model makes a mistake, could it be because something by chance is not as supported by the pre-training data? “Support by pre-training” is maybe a loose term. I don’t know if I can add anything more useful on this. I don’t think there is a human analog to pre-training.evolution as doing some kind of searchI’m curious if you think either of these are analogous to pre-training. How would you think about what lifetime human learning is like, if not pre-training?amount of pre-training dataSomehow a human being, after even 15 years with a tiny fraction of the pre-training data, they know much less. But whatever they do know, they know much more deeply somehow. Already at that age, you would not make mistakes that our AIs make.There is another thing. You might say, could it be something like evolution? The answer is maybe. But in this case, I think evolution might actually have an edge. I remember reading about this case. One way in which neuroscientists can learn about the brain is by studying people with brain damage to different parts of the brain. Some people have the most strange symptoms you could imagine. It’s actually really, really interesting.brain damage, a stroke or an accident, that took out his emotional processingrole of our built-in emotions in making us a viable agentvalue functionI think it could. I’m just saying it’s not 100% obvious.MLIt should be some kind of a value function thing. But I don’t think there is a great ML analogy because right now, value functions don’t play a very prominent role in the things people do.It might be worth defining for the audience what a value function is, if you want to do that.reinforcement learningagentsneural neto1R1The value function says something like, “Maybe I could sometimes, not always, tell you if you are doing well or badly.” The notion of a value function is more useful in some domains than others. For example, when you play chess and you lose a piece, I messed up. You don’t need to play the whole game to know that what I just did was bad, and therefore whatever preceded it was also bad.The value function lets you short-circuit the wait until the very end. Let’s suppose that you are doing some kind of a math thing or a programming thing, and you’re trying to explore a particular solution or direction. After, let’s say, a thousand steps of thinking, you concluded that this direction is unpromising. As soon as you conclude this, you could already get a reward signal a thousand timesteps previously, when you decided to pursue down this path. You say, “Next time I shouldn’t pursue this path in a similar situation,” long before you actually came up with the proposed solution.DeepSeek R1 paperdeep learningWhat I was alluding to with the person whose emotional center got damaged, it’s more that maybe what it suggests is that the value function of humans is modulated by emotions in some important way that’s hardcoded by evolution. And maybe that is important for people to be effective in the world.That’s the thing I was planning on asking you. There’s something really interesting about emotions of the value function, which is that it’s impressive that they have this much utility while still being rather simple to understand.I have two responses. I do agree that compared to the kind of things that we learn and the things we are talking about, the kind of AI we are talking about, emotions are relatively simple. They might even be so simple that maybe you could map them out in a human-understandable way. I think it would be cool to do.In terms of utility though, I think there is a thing where there is this complexity-robustness tradeoff, where complex things can be very useful, but simple things are very useful in a very broad range of situations. One way to interpret what we are seeing is that we’ve got these emotions that evolved mostly from our mammal ancestors and then fine-tuned a little bit while we were hominids, just a bit. We do have a decent amount of social emotions though which mammals may lack. But they’re not very sophisticated. And because they’re not sophisticated, they serve us so well in this very different world compared to the one that we’ve been living in.Actually, they also make mistakes. For example, our emotions… Well actually, I don’t know. Does hunger count as an emotion? It’s debatable. But I think, for example, our intuitive feeling of hunger is not succeeding in guiding us correctly in this world with an abundance of food.parametersHere’s a perspective that I think might be true. The way ML used to work is that people would just tinker with stuff and try to get interesting results. That’s what’s been going on in the past.Scaling lawsGPT-3everyone realized we should scale.The big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, “Hey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you’ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.” This is also great. Companies love this because it gives you a very low-risk way of investing your resources.It’s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that. If you research, you need to be like, “Go forth researchers and research and come up with something”, versus get more data, get more compute. You know you’ll get something from pre-training.age of scalingBut now the scale is so big. Is the belief really, “Oh, it’s so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?” It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don’t think that’s true. So it’s back to the age of research again, just with big computers.That’s a very interesting way to put it. But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I’m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss. What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?rolloutsI wouldn’t even call it scaling. I would say, “Hey, what are you doing? Is the thing you are doing the most productive thing you could be doing? Can you find a more productive way of using your compute?” We’ve discussed the value function business earlier. Maybe once people get good at value functions, they will be using their resources more productively. If you find a whole other way of training models, you could say, “Is this scaling or is it just using your resources?” I think it becomes a little bit ambiguous.In the sense that, when people were in the age of research back then, it was, “Let’s try this and this and this. Let’s try that and that and that. Oh, look, something interesting is happening.” I think there will be a return to that.LLM-as-a-JudgeThe discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that’s going to make RL more efficient, and I think that makes a difference. But I think anything you can do with a value function, you can do without, just more slowly. The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people. It’s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.sample efficiencycontinual learningYou could actually wonder that one possible explanation for the human sample efficiency that needs to be considered is evolution. Evolution has given us a small amount of the most useful information possible. For things like vision, hearing, and locomotion, I think there’s a pretty strong case that evolution has given us a lot.For example, human dexterity far exceeds… I mean robots can become dexterous too if you subject them to a huge amount of training in simulation. But to train a robot in the real world to quickly pick up a new skill like a person does seems very out of reach. Here you could say, “Oh yeah, locomotion. All our ancestors needed great locomotion, squirrels. So with locomotion, maybe we’ve got some unbelievable prior.”Yann LeCunBut you could say maybe that’s evolution too. But in language and math and coding, probably not.It still seems better than models. Obviously, models are better than the average human at language, math, and coding. But are they better than the average human at learning?Oh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. What I meant to say is that language, math, and coding—and especially math and coding—suggests that whatever it is that makes people good at learning is probably not so much a complicated prior, but something more, some fundamental thing.I’m not sure I understood. Why should that be the case?So consider a skill in which people exhibit some kind of great reliability. If the skill is one that was very useful to our ancestors for many millions of years, hundreds of millions of years, you could argue that maybe humans are good at it because of evolution, because we have a prior, an evolutionary prior that’s encoded in some very non-obvious way that somehow makes us so good at it.But if people exhibit great ability, reliability, robustness, and ability to learn in a domain that really did not exist until recently, then this is more an indication that people might have just better machine learning, period.How should we think about what that is? What is the ML analogy? There are a couple of interesting things about it. It takes fewer samples. It’s more unsupervised. A child learning to drive a car… Children are not learning to drive a car. A teenager learning how to drive a car is not exactly getting some prebuilt, verifiable reward. It comes from their interaction with the machine and with the environment. It takes much fewer samples. It seems more unsupervised. It seems more robust?Much more robust. The robustness of people is really staggering.Do you have a unified way of thinking about why all these things are happening at once? What is the ML analogy that could realize something like this?One of the things that you’ve been asking about is how can the teenage driver self-correct and learn from their experience without an external teacher? The answer is that they have their value function. They have a general sense which is also, by the way, extremely robust in people. Whatever the human value function is, with a few exceptions around addiction, it’s actually very, very robust.So for something like a teenager that’s learning to drive, they start to drive, and they already have a sense of how they’re driving immediately, how badly they are, how unconfident. And then they see, “Okay.” And then, of course, the learning speed of any teenager is so fast. After 10 hours, you’re good to go.It seems like humans have some solution, but I’m curious about how they are doing it and why is it so hard? How do we need to reconceptualize the way we’re training models to make something like this possible?That is a great question to ask, and it’s a question I have a lot of opinions about. But unfortunately, we live in a world where not all machine learning ideas are discussed freely, and this is one of them. There’s probably a way to do it. I think it can be done. The fact that people are like that, I think it’s a proof that it can be done.There may be another blocker though, which is that there is a possibility that the human neurons do more compute than we think. If that is true, and if that plays an important role, then things might be more difficult. But regardless, I do think it points to the existence of some machine learning principle that I have opinions on. But unfortunately, circumstances make it hard to discuss in detail.Nobody listens to this podcast, Ilya.I’m curious. If you say we are back in an era of research, you were there from 2012 to 2020. What is the vibe now going to be if we go back to the era of research?AlexNetYou were at Google and OpenAI and Stanford, these places, when there was more of a vibe of research? What kind of things should we be expecting in the community?One consequence of the age of scaling is that scaling sucked out all the air in the room. Because scaling sucked out all the air in the room, everyone started to do the same thing. We got to the point where we are in a world where there are more companies than ideas by quite a bit. Actually on that, there is this Silicon Valley saying that says that ideas are cheap, execution is everything. People say that a lot, and there is truth to that. But then I saw someone say on Twitter something like, “If ideas are so cheap, how come no one’s having any ideas?” And I think it’s true too.If you think about research progress in terms of bottlenecks, there are several bottlenecks. One of them is ideas, and one of them is your ability to bring them to life, which might be compute but also engineering. If you go back to the ‘90s, let’s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.GPUstransformerResNeto1 reasoningSo for research, you definitely need some amount of compute, but it’s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever for research. You might argue, and I think it is true, that if you want to build the absolutely best system then it helps to have much more compute. Especially if everyone is within the same paradigm, then compute becomes one of the big differentiators.I’m asking you for the history, because you were actually there. I’m not sure what actually happened. It sounds like it was possible to develop these ideas using minimal amounts of compute. But the transformer didn’t immediately become famous. It became the thing everybody started doing and then started experimenting on top of and building on top of because it was validated at higher and higher levels of compute.SSII can comment on that. The short comment is that you mentioned SSI. Specifically for us, the amount of compute that SSI has for research is really not that small. I want to explain why. Simple math can explain why the amount of compute that we have is comparable for research than one might think. I’ll explain.SSI has raised $3 billioninferenceThe other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.There have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they’re spending on inference and so forth. So it seems like they’re spending more a year running research experiments than you guys have in total funding.I think it’s a question of what you do with it. It’s a question of what you do with it. In their case, in the case of others, there is a lot more demand on the training compute. There’s a lot more different work streams, there are different modalities, there is just more stuff. So it becomes fragmented.My answer to this question is something like this. Right now, we just focus on the research, and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.Is SSI’s plan still to straight shot superintelligence?Maybe. I think that there is merit to it. I think there’s a lot of merit because it’s very nice to not be affected by the day-to-day market competition. But I think there are two reasons that may cause us to change the plan. One is pragmatic, if timelines turned out to be long, which they might. Second, I think there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world. I think this is a meaningfully valuable thing.So then why is your default plan to straight shot superintelligence? Because it sounds like OpenAI, Anthropic, all these other companies, their explicit thinking is, “Look, we have weaker and weaker intelligences that the public can get used to and prepare for.” Why is it potentially better to build a superintelligence directly?I’ll make the case for and against. The case for is that one of the challenges that people face when they’re in the market is that they have to participate in the rat race. The rat race is quite difficult in that it exposes you to difficult trade-offs which you need to make. It is nice to say, “We’ll insulate ourselves from all this and just focus on the research and come out only when we are ready, and not before.” But the counterpoint is valid too, and those are opposing forces. The counterpoint is, “Hey, it is useful for the world to see powerful AI. It is useful for the world to see powerful AI because that’s the only way you can communicate it.”Well, I guess not even just that you can communicate the idea—Communicate the AI, not the idea. Communicate the AI.What do you mean, “communicate the AI”?Let’s suppose you write an essay about AI, and the essay says, “AI is going to be this, and AI is going to be that, and it’s going to be this.” You read it and you say, “Okay, this is an interesting essay.” Now suppose you see an AI doing this, an AI doing that. It is incomparable. Basically I think that there is a big benefit from AI being in the public, and that would be a reason for us to not be quite straight shot.Linuxmalevolent paper clipperWell I think on this point, even in the straight shot scenario, you would still do a gradual release of it, that’s how I would imagine it. Gradualism would be an inherent component of any plan. It’s just a question of what is the first thing that you get out of the door. That’s number one.you have advocated for continual learning more than other peopleAGInarrow AIgameplay and AIcheckers AIchess AIcomputer games AIchess AI can beat KasparovThe second thing that got a lot of traction is pre-training, specifically the recipe of pre-training. I think the way people do RL now is maybe undoing the conceptual imprint of pre-training. But pre-training had this property. You do more pre-training and the model gets better at everything, more or less uniformly. General AI. Pre-training gives AGI.But the thing that happened with AGI and pre-training is that in some sense they overshot the target. If you think about the term “AGI”, especially in the context of pre-training, you will realize that a human being is not an AGI. Yes, there is definitely a foundation of skills, but a human being lacks a huge amount of knowledge. Instead, we rely on continual learning.So when you think about, “Okay, so let’s suppose that we achieve success and we produce some kind of safe superintelligence.” The question is, how do you define it? Where on the curve of continual learning is it going to be?I produce a superintelligent 15-year-old that’s very eager to go. They don’t know very much at all, a great student, very eager. You go and be a programmer, you go and be a doctor, go and learn. So you could imagine that the deployment itself will involve some kind of a learning trial-and-error period. It’s a process, as opposed to you dropping the finished thing.OpenAI charterBut once you have the learning algorithm, it gets deployed into the world the same way a human laborer might join an organization.It seems like one of these two things might happen, maybe neither of these happens. One, this super-efficient learning algorithm becomes superhuman, becomes as good as you and potentially even better, at the task of ML research. As a result the algorithm itself becomes more and more superhuman.The other is, even if that doesn’t happen, if you have a single model—this is explicitly your vision—where instances of a model which are deployed through the economy doing different jobs, learning how to do those jobs, continually learning on the job, picking up all the skills that any human could pick up, but picking them all up at the same time, and then amalgamating their learnings, you basically have a model which functionally becomes superintelligent even without any sort of recursive self-improvement in software. Because you now have one model that can do every single job in the economy and humans can’t merge our minds in the same way. So do you expect some sort of intelligence explosion from broad deployment?I think that it is likely that we will have rapid economic growth. I think with broad deployment, there are two arguments you could make which are conflicting. One is that once indeed you get to a point where you have an AI that can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong force to deploy them in the economy unless there will be some kind of a regulation that stops it, which by the way there might be.But the idea of very rapid economic growth for some time, I think it’s very possible from broad deployment. The question is how rapid it’s going to be. I think this is hard to know because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big and there’s a lot of stuff, and that stuff moves at a different speed. But then on the other hand, now the AI could… So I think very rapid economic growth is possible. We will see all kinds of things like different countries with different rules and the ones which have the friendlier rules, the economic growth will be faster. Hard to predict.It seems to me that this is a very precarious situation to be in. In the limit, we know that this should be possible. If you have something that is as good as a human at learning, but which can merge its brains—merge different instances in a way that humans can’t merge—already, this seems like a thing that should physically be possible. Humans are possible, digital computers are possible. You just need both of those combined to produce this thing.Dyson sphereOne of the ways in which my thinking has been changing is that I now place more importance on AI being deployed incrementally and in advance. One very difficult thing about AI is that we are talking about systems that don’t yet exist and it’s hard to imagine them.I think that one of the things that’s happening is that in practice, it’s very hard to feel the AGI. It’s very hard to feel the AGI. We can talk about it, but imagine having a conversation about how it is like to be old when you’re old and frail. You can have a conversation, you can try to imagine it, but it’s just hard, and you come back to reality where that’s not the case. I think that a lot of the issues around AGI and its future power stem from the fact that it’s very difficult to imagine. Future AI is going to be different. It’s going to be powerful. Indeed, the whole problem, what is the problem of AI and AGI? The whole problem is the power. The whole problem is the power.When the power is really big, what’s going to happen? One of the ways in which I’ve changed my mind over the past year—and that change of mind, I’ll hedge a little bit, may back-propagate into the plans of our company—is that if it’s hard to imagine, what do you do? You’ve got to be showing the thing. You’ve got to be showing the thing. I maintain that most people who work on AI also can’t imagine it because it’s too different from what people see on a day-to-day basis.OpenAI and Anthropic doing a first small stepThat’s number one. Number two, okay, so the AI is being built. What needs to be done? One thing that I maintain that will happen is that right now, people who are working on AI, I maintain that the AI doesn’t feel powerful because of its mistakes. I do think that at some point the AI will start to feel powerful actually. I think when that happens, we will see a big change in the way all AI companies approach safety. They’ll become much more paranoid. I say this as a prediction that we will see happen. We’ll see if I’m right. But I think this is something that will happen because they will see the AI becoming more powerful. Everything that’s happening right now, I maintain, is because people look at today’s AI and it’s hard to imagine the future AI.There is a third thing which needs to happen. I’m talking about it in broader terms, not just from the perspective of SSI because you asked me about our company. The question is, what should the companies aspire to build? What should they aspire to build? There has been one big idea that everyone has been locked into, which is the self-improving AI. Why did it happen? Because there are fewer ideas than companies. But I maintain that there is something that’s better to build, and I think that everyone will want that.mirror neuronshuman empathy for animalsalignmentIt’s true. It’s possible it’s not the best criterion. I’ll say two things. Number one, care for sentient life, I think there is merit to it. It should be considered. I think it would be helpful if there was some kind of short list of ideas that the companies, when they are in this situation, could use. That’s number two.Number three, I think it would be really materially helpful if the power of the most powerful superintelligence was somehow capped because it would address a lot of these concerns. The question of how to do it, I’m not sure, but I think that would be materially helpful when you’re talking about really, really powerful systems.Before we continue the alignment discussion, I want to double-click on that. How much room is there at the top? How do you think about superintelligence? Do you think, using this learning efficiency idea, maybe it is just extremely fast at learning new skills or new knowledge? Does it just have a bigger pool of strategies? Is there a single cohesive “it” in the center that’s more powerful or bigger? If so, do you imagine that this will be sort of godlike in comparison to the rest of human civilization, or does it just feel like another agent, or another cluster of agents?This is an area where different people have different intuitions. I think it will be very powerful, for sure. What I think is most likely to happen is that there will be multiple such AIs being created roughly at the same time. I think that if the cluster is big enough—like if the cluster is literally continent-sized—that thing could be really powerful, indeed. If you literally have a continent-sized cluster, those AIs can be very powerful. All I can tell you is that if you’re talking about extremely powerful AIs, truly dramatically powerful, it would be nice if they could be restrained in some ways or if there were some kind of agreement or something.What is the concern of superintelligence? What is one way to explain the concern? If you imagine a system that is sufficiently powerful, really sufficiently powerful—and you could say you need to do something sensible like care for sentient life in a very single-minded way—we might not like the results. That’s really what it is.Maybe, by the way, the answer is that you do not build an RL agent in the usual sense. I’ll point several things out. I think human beings are semi-RL agents. We pursue a reward, and then the emotions or whatever make us tire out of the reward and we pursue a different reward. The market is a very short-sighted kind of agent. Evolution is the same. Evolution is very intelligent in some ways, but very dumb in other ways. The government has been designed to be a never-ending fight between three parts, which has an effect. So I think things like this.Another thing that makes this discussion difficult is that we are talking about systems that don’t exist, that we don’t know how to build. That’s the other thing and that’s actually my belief. I think what people are doing right now will go some distance and then peter out. It will continue to improve, but it will also not be “it”. The “It” we don’t know how to build, and a lot hinges on understanding reliable generalization.I’ll say another thing. One of the things that you could say about what causes alignment to be difficult is that your ability to learn human values is fragile. Then your ability to optimize them is fragile. You actually learn to optimize them. And can’t you say, “Are these not all instances of unreliable generalization?” Why is it that human beings appear to generalize so much better? What if generalization was much better? What would happen in this case? What would be the effect? But those questions are right now still unanswerable.How does one think about what AI going well looks like? You’ve scoped out how AI might evolve. We’ll have these sort of continual learning agents. AI will be very powerful. Maybe there will be many different AIs. How do you think about lots of continent-sized compute intelligences going around? How dangerous is that? How do we make that less dangerous? And how do we do that in a way that protects an equilibrium where there might be misaligned AIs out there and bad actors out there?Here’s one reason why I liked “AI that cares for sentient life”. We can debate on whether it’s good or bad. But if the first N of these dramatic systems do care for, love, humanity or something, care for sentient life, obviously this also needs to be achieved. This needs to be achieved. So if this is achieved by the first N of those systems, then I can see it go well, at least for quite some time.Then there is the question of what happens in the long run. How do you achieve a long-run equilibrium? I think that there, there is an answer as well. I don’t like this answer, but it needs to be considered.In the long run, you might say, “Okay, if you have a world where powerful AIs exist, in the short term, you could say you have universal high income. You have universal high income and we’re all doing well.” But what do the Buddhists say? “Change is the only constant.” Things change. There is some kind of government, political structure thing, and it changes because these things have a shelf life. Some new government thing comes up and it functions, and then after some time it stops functioning. That’s something that we see happening all the time.So I think for the long-run equilibrium, one approach is that you could say maybe every person will have an AI that will do their bidding, and that’s good. If that could be maintained indefinitely, that’s true. But the downside with that is then the AI goes and earns money for the person and advocates for their needs in the political sphere, and maybe then writes a little report saying, “Okay, here’s what I’ve done, here’s the situation,” and the person says, “Great, keep it up.” But the person is no longer a participant. Then you can say that’s a precarious place to be in.NeuralinkI wonder if the fact that emotions which were developed millions—or in many cases, billions—of years ago in a totally different environment are still guiding our actions so strongly is an example of alignment success.brainstemcortexI think there’s a more general point. I think it’s actually really mysterious how evolution encodes high-level desires. It’s pretty easy to understand how evolution would endow us with the desire for food that smells good because smell is a chemical, so just pursue that chemical. It’s very easy to imagine evolution doing that thing.But evolution also has endowed us with all these social desires. We really care about being seen positively by society. We care about being in good standing. All these social intuitions that we have, I feel strongly that they’re baked in. I don’t know how evolution did it because it’s a high-level concept that’s represented in the brain.Let’s say you care about some social thing, it’s not a low-level signal like smell. It’s not something for which there is a sensor. The brain needs to do a lot of processing to piece together lots of bits of information to understand what’s going on socially. Somehow evolution said, “That’s what you should care about.” How did it do it?It did it quickly, too. All these sophisticated social things that we care about, I think they evolved pretty recently. Evolution had an easy time hard-coding this high-level desire. I’m unaware of a good hypothesis for how it’s done. I had some ideas I was kicking around, but none of them are satisfying.What’s especially impressive is it was desire that you learned in your lifetime, it makes sense because your brain is intelligent. It makes sense why you would be able to learn intelligent desires. Maybe this is not your point, but one way to understand it is that the desire is built into the genome, and the genome is not intelligent. But you’re somehow able to describe this feature. It’s not even clear how you define that feature, and you can build it into the genes.Essentially, or maybe I’ll put it differently. If you think about the tools that are available to the genome, it says, “Okay, here’s a recipe for building a brain.” You could say, “Here is a recipe for connecting the dopamine neurons to the smell sensor.” And if the smell is a certain kind of good smell, you want to eat that.I could imagine the genome doing that. I’m claiming that it is harder to imagine. It’s harder to imagine the genome saying you should care about some complicated computation that your entire brain, a big chunk of your brain, does. That’s all I’m claiming. I can tell you a speculation of how it could be done. Let me offer a speculation, and I’ll explain why the speculation is probably false.cortexspeech processingAll the regions are mostly located in the same place from person to person. So maybe evolution hard-coded literally a location on the brain. So it says, “Oh, when the GPS coordinates of the brain such and such, when that fires, that’s what you should care about.” Maybe that’s what evolution did because that would be within the toolkit of evolution.Yeah, although there are examples where, for example, people who are born blind have that area of their cortex adopted by another sense. I have no idea, but I’d be surprised if the desires or the reward functions which require a visual signal no longer worked for people who have their different areas of their cortex co-opted.For example, if you no longer have vision, can you still feel the sense that I want people around me to like me and so forth, which usually there are also visual cues for.I fully agree with that. I think there’s an even stronger counterargument to this theory. There are people who get half of their brains removed in childhood, and they still have all their brain regions. But they all somehow move to just one hemisphere, which suggests that the brain regions, their location is not fixed and so that theory is not true.It would have been cool if it was true, but it’s not. So I think that’s a mystery. But it’s an interesting mystery. The fact is that somehow evolution was able to endow us to care about social stuff very, very reliably. Even people who have all kinds of strange mental conditions and deficiencies and emotional problems tend to care about this also.What is SSI planning on doing differently? Presumably your plan is to be one of the frontier companies when this time arrives. Presumably you started SSI because you’re like, “I think I have a way of approaching how to do this safely in a way that the other companies don’t.” What is that difference?The way I would describe it is that there are some ideas that I think are promising and I want to investigate them and see if they are indeed promising or not. It’s really that simple. It’s an attempt. If the ideas turn out to be correct—these ideas that we discussed around understanding generalization—then I think we will have something worthy.Will they turn out to be correct? We are doing research. We are squarely an “age of research” company. We are making progress. We’ve actually made quite good progress over the past year, but we need to keep making more progress, more research. That’s how I see it. I see it as an attempt to be a voice and a participant.Meta came in and offered to acquire usIt sounds like SSI’s plan is to be a company that is at the frontier when you get to this very important period in human history where you have superhuman intelligence. You have these ideas about how to make superhuman intelligence go well. But other companies will be trying their own ideas. What distinguishes SSI’s approach to making superintelligence go well?The main thing that distinguishes SSI is its technical approach. We have a different technical approach that I think is worthy and we are pursuing it.I maintain that in the end there will be a convergence of strategies. I think there will be a convergence of strategies where at some point, as AI becomes more powerful, it’s going to become more or less clearer to everyone what the strategy should be. It should be something like, you need to find some way to talk to each other and you want your first actual real superintelligent AI to be aligned and somehow care for sentient life, care for people, democratic, one of those, some combination thereof.Speaking of forecasts, what are your forecasts to this system you’re describing, which can learn as well as a human and subsequently, as a result, become superhuman?I just want to unroll how you might see the world coming. It’s like, we have a couple more years where these other companies are continuing the current approach and it stalls out. “Stalls out” here meaning they earn no more than low hundreds of billions in revenue? How do you think about what stalling out means?I think stalling out will look like…it will all look very similar among all the different companies. It could be something like this. I’m not sure because I think even with stalling out, I think these companies could make a stupendous revenue. Maybe not profits because they will need to work hard to differentiate each other from themselves, but revenue definitely.But something in your model implies that when the correct solution does emerge, there will be convergence between all the companies. I’m curious why you think that’s the case.I was talking more about convergence on their alignment strategies. I think eventual convergence on the technical approach is probably going to happen as well, but I was alluding to convergence to the alignment strategies. What exactly is the thing that should be done?Thinking MachinesI think it won’t be clear how to do it, but it will be clear that something different is possible, and that is information. People will then be trying to figure out how that works. I do think though that one of the things not addressed here, not discussed, is that with each increase in the AI’s capabilities, I think there will be some kind of changes, but I don’t know exactly which ones, in how things are being done. I think it’s going to be important, yet I can’t spell out what that is exactly.By default, you would expect the company that has that model to be getting all these gains because they have the model that has the skills and knowledge that it’s building up in the world. What is the reason to think that the benefits of that would be widely distributed and not just end up at whatever model company gets this continuous learning loop going first?Here is what I think is going to happen. Number one, let’s look at how things have gone so far with the AIs of the past. One company produced an advance and the other company scrambled and produced some similar things after some amount of time and they started to compete in the market and push the prices down. So I think from the market perspective, something similar will happen there as well.We are talking about the good world, by the way. What’s the good world? It’s where we have these powerful human-like learners that are also… By the way, maybe there’s another thing we haven’t discussed on the spec of the superintelligent AI that I think is worth considering. It’s that you make it narrow, it can be useful and narrow at the same time. You can have lots of narrow superintelligent AIs.But suppose you have many of them and you have some company that’s producing a lot of profits from it. Then you have another company that comes in and starts to compete. The way the competition is going to work is through specialization. Competition loves specialization. You see it in the market, you see it in evolution as well. You’re going to have lots of different niches and you’re going to have lots of different companies who are occupying different niches. In this world we might say one AI company is really quite a bit better at some area of really complicated economic activity and a different company is better at another area. And the third company is really good at litigation.Isn’t this contradicted by what human-like learning implies? It’s that it can learn…It can, but you have accumulated learning. You have a big investment. You spent a lot of compute to become really, really good, really phenomenal at this thing. Someone else spent a huge amount of compute and a huge amount of experience to get really good at some other thing. You apply a lot of human learning to get there, but now you are at this high point where someone else would say, “Look, I don’t want to start learning what you’ve learned.”I guess that would require many different companies to begin at the human-like continual learning agent at the same time so that they can start their different tree search in different branches. But if one company gets that agent first, or gets that learner first, it does then seem like… Well, if you just think about every single job in the economy, having an instance learning each one seems tractable for a company.That’s a valid argument. My strong intuition is that it’s not how it’s going to go. The argument says it will go this way, but my strong intuition is that it will not go this way. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. I think that’s going to be one of those.A lot of people’s models of recursive self-improvement literally, explicitly state we will have a million Ilyas in a server that are coming up with different ideas, and this will lead to a superintelligence emerging very fast.Do you have some intuition about how parallelizable the thing you are doing is? What are the gains from making copies of Ilya?I don’t know. I think there’ll definitely be diminishing returns because you want people who think differently rather than the same. If there were literal copies of me, I’m not sure how much more incremental value you’d get. People who think differently, that’s what you want.Why is it that if you look at different models, even released by totally different companies trained on potentially non-overlapping datasets, it’s actually crazy how similar LLMs are to each other?Maybe the datasets are not as non-overlapping as it seems.But there’s some sense in which even if an individual human might be less productive than the future AI, maybe there’s something to the fact that human teams have more diversity than teams of AIs might have. How do we elicit meaningful diversity among AIs? I think just raising the temperature just results in gibberish. You want something more like different scientists have different prejudices or different ideas. How do you get that kind of diversity among AI agents?post-traininghint in the pastself-playLLMsI would say there are two things to say. The reason why I thought self-play was interesting is because it offered a way to create models using compute only, without data. If you think that data is the ultimate bottleneck, then using compute only is very interesting. So that’s what makes it interesting.The thing is that self-play, at least the way it was done in the past—when you have agents which somehow compete with each other—it’s only good for developing a certain set of skills. It is too narrow. It’s only good for negotiation, conflict, certain social skills, strategizing, that kind of stuff. If you care about those skills, then self-play will be useful.prover-verifierLLM-as-a-JudgeReally self-play is a special case of more general competition between agents. The natural response to competition is to try to be different. So if you were to put multiple agents together and you tell them, “You all need to work on some problem and you are an agent and you’re inspecting what everyone else is working,” they’re going to say, “Well, if they’re already taking this approach, it’s not clear I should pursue it. I should pursue something differentiated.” So I think something like this could also create an incentive for a diversity of approaches.Final question: What is research taste? You’re obviously the person in the world who is considered to have the best taste in doing research in AI. You were the co-author on the biggest things that have happened in the history of deep learning, from AlexNet to GPT-3 to so on. What is it, how do you characterize how you come up with these ideas?I can comment on this for myself. I think different people do it differently. One thing that guides me personally is an aesthetic of how AI should be, by thinking about how people are, but thinking correctly. It’s very easy to think about how people are incorrectly, but what does it mean to think about people correctly?artificial neuronfoldsdistributed representationI think that’s been guiding me a fair bit, thinking from multiple angles and looking for almost beauty, beauty and simplicity. Ugliness, there’s no room for ugliness. It’s beauty, simplicity, elegance, correct inspiration from the brain. All of those things need to be present at the same time. The more they are present, the more confident you can be in a top-down belief.The top-down belief is the thing that sustains you when the experiments contradict you. Because if you trust the data all the time, well sometimes you can be doing the correct thing but there’s a bug. But you don’t know that there is a bug. How can you tell that there is a bug? How do you know if you should keep debugging or you conclude it’s the wrong direction? It’s the top-down. You can say things have to be this way. Something like this has to work, therefore we’ve got to keep going. That’s the top-down, and it’s based on this multifaceted beauty and inspiration by the brain.Alright, we’ll leave it there.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest news bulletin | November 25th, 2025 – Evening</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYjeesT9TAs</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OYjeesT9TAs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:12:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Latest news bulletin | November 25th, 2025 – Evening

How we achieved 20% faster mobile response times, improved SEO, and reduced infrastructure load.
How we achieved 20% faster mobile response times, improved SEO, and reduced infrastructure load.Until now, when you visited a wiki (like ), the server responded in one of two ways: a desktop page, or a redirect to the equivalent mobile URL (like ). This mobile URL in turn served the mobile version of the page from MediaWiki. Our servers have operated this way since 2011, when we deployed MobileFrontend.Over the past two months we unified the mobile and desktop domain for all wikis (timeline). This means we no longer redirect mobile users to a separate domain while the page is loading.We completed the change on Wednesday 8 October after deploying to English Wikipedia. The mobile domains became dormant within 24 hours, which confirms that most mobile traffic arrived on Wikipedia via the standard domains and thus experienced a redirect until now.Why did we have a separate mobile domain? And, why did we believe that changing this might benefit us?The year is 2008 and all sorts of websites large and small have a mobile subdomain. The BBC, IMDb, Facebook, and newspapers around the world all featured the iconic m-dot domain. For Wikipedia, a separate mobile domain made the mobile experiment low-risk to launch and avoided technical limitations. It became the default in 2011 by way of a redirect.Fast-forward seventeen years, and much has changed. It is no longer common for websites to have m-dot domains. Wikipedia’s use of it is surprising to our present day audience, and it may decrease the perceived strength of domain branding. The technical limitations we had in 2008 have long been solved, with the Wikimedia CDN having efficient and well-tested support for variable responses under a single URL. And above all, we had reason to believe Google stopped supporting separate mobile domains, which motivated the project to start when it did.Google used to link from mobile search results directly to our mobile domain, but last year this stopped. This exposed a huge part of our audience to the mobile redirect and regressed mobile response times by 10-20%.Google supported mobile domains in 2008 by letting you advertise a separate mobile URL. While Google only indexed the desktop site for content, they stored this mobile URL and linked to it when searching from a mobile device. This allowed Google referrals to skip over the redirect.Google introduced a new crawler in 2016, and gradually re-indexed the Internet with it. This new “mobile-first” crawler acts like a mobile device rather than a desktop device, and removes the ability to advertise a separate mobile or desktop link. It’s now one link for everyone! Wikipedia.org was among the last sites Google switched, with May 2024 as the apparent change window. This meant the 60% of incoming pageviews referred by Google, now had to wait for the same redirect that the other 40% of referrals have experienced since 2011.Unifying our domains eliminated the redirect and led to a 20% improvement in mobile response times. This improvement is both a recovery  a net-improvement because it applies to everyone! It recovers the regression that Google-referred traffic started to experience last year, but also improves response times for all other traffic by the same amount.The graphs below show how the change was felt worldwide. The “Worldwide p50” corresponds to what you might experience in Germany or Italy, with fast connectivity close to our data centers. The “Worldwide p80” resembles what you might experience in Iran browsing the Persian Wikipedia.The first site affected was not Wikipedia but Commons. Wikimedia Commons is the free media repository used by Wikipedia and its sister projects. Tim Starling found in June that only half of the 140 million pages on Commons were known to Google. And of these known pages, 20 million were also delisted due to the mobile redirect. This had been growing by one million delisted pages every month. The cause for delisting turned out to be the mobile redirect. You see, the new Google crawler, just like your browser, also has to follow the mobile redirect.After following the redirect, the crawler reads our page metadata which points back to the standard domain as the preferred one. This creates a loop that can prevent a page from being updated or listed in Google Search. Delisting is not a matter of ranking, but about whether a page is even in the search index.Tim and myself disabled the mobile redirect for “Googlebot on Commons” through an emergency intervention on June 23rd. Referrals then began to come back, and kept rising for eleven weeks in a row, until reaching a 100% increase in Google-referrals. From a baseline of 3 million weekly pageviews up to 6 million. Google’s data on clickthroughs shows a similar increase from 1M to 1.8M “clicks”.We reversed last year’s regression  set a new all-time high. We think there’s three reasons Commons reached new highs:The redirect consumed half of the crawl budget, thus limiting how many pages could be crawled.Google switched Commons to its new crawler some years before Wikipedia. The index had likely been shrinking for two years already.Pages on Commons have a sparse link graph. Wikipedia has a rich network of links between articles, whereas pages on Commons represent a photo with an image description that rarely links to other files. This unique page structure makes it hard to discover Commons pages through recursive crawling without a sitemap.Unifying our domains lifted a ceiling we didn’t know was there!The MediaWiki software has a built-in sitemap generator, but we disabled this on Wikimedia sites over a decade ago. We decided to enable it for Commons and submitted it to Google on August 6th. Google has since indexed 70 million new pages for Commons, up 140% since June.We also found that less than 0.1% of videos on Commons were recognised by Google as video watch pages (for the Google Search “Videos” tab). I raised this in a partnership meeting with Google Search, and it may’ve been a bug on their end. Commons started showing up in Google Videos a week later.When sharing links from a mobile device, such link previously hardcoded the mobile domain. Links shared from a mobile device gave you the mobile site, even when received on desktop. The “Desktop” link in the footer of the mobile site pointed to the standard domain and disabled the standard-to-mobile redirect for you, on the assumption you arrived on the mobile site via the redirect. The “Desktop” link did not remember your choice on the mobile domain itself, and there existed no equivalent mobile-to-standard redirect for when you arrive there. This meant a shared mobile link always presented the mobile site, even after opting-out on desktop.Everyone now shares the same domain which naturally shows the appropiate version.There is a long tail of stable referrals from news articles, research papers, blogs, talk pages, and mailing lists that refer to the mobile domain. We plan to support this indefinitely. To limit operational complexity, we now serve these through a simple whole-domain redirect. This has the benefit of retroactively fixing the UX issue because old mobile links now redirect to the standard domain.This resolves a long-standing bug with workarounds in the form of shared user scripts, browser extensions, and personal scripts.After publishing an edit, MediaWiki instructs the Wikimedia CDN to clear the cache of affected articles (“purge”). It has been a perennial concern from SRE teams at WMF that our CDN purge rates are unsustainable. For every purge from MediaWiki core, the MobileFrontend extension would add a copy for the mobile domain.After unifying our domains we turned off these duplicate purges, and cut the MediaWiki purge rate by 50%. Over the past weeks the Wikimedia CDN processed approximately 4 billion fewer purges a day. MediaWiki used to send purges at a baseline rate of 40K/second with spikes up to 300K/second, and both have been halved. Factoring in other services, the Wikimedia CDN now receives 20% to 40% fewer purges per second overall, depending on the edit activity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the World’s Wealthiest Are Sending Their Gold to Singapore | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-tkyydSCc</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qf-tkyydSCc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:01:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As gold prices surge to a record $4,000, more of the world’s wealthiest from places like Europe, the U.S. and Australia are storing their gold in Singapore in vaults like The Reserve.

The number of people in Poland abusing this powerful painkiller is growing. There have been dozens of fatalities.

Michal lives in a small town south of Gdansk. Because of the stigma surrounding people with addiction, he prefers to remain anonymous. Every two weeks, he travels to Święciec to take methadone, a substitute drug, at the addiction clinic of the psychiatric hospital. After using various drugs, he started taking fentanyl, the strongest of all opiates. 
Fentanyl is used to treat people with severe pain and as an anesthetic. Addicts remove the gel from pain patches and inject it directly into their bloodstream. There have been dozens of fatal overdoses in Poland. Michal has also lost one of his close friends. Corrupt pharmacists are believed to have sold large quantities of fentanyl patches to dealers. The authorities have since put a stop to this.  
In Żuromin, Jadwiga Karpinska lost her son Pawel to a fatal overdose. Their town, a two-hour drive from the capital Warsaw, was known as the country’s unofficial fentanyl capital in 2024. That changed when police detained a well-known local dealer. The drug continues to be available there, but in smaller quantities.
Elementary school teacher Adam Ejnik believes in prevention. He wants to keep his students away from the drug by raising awareness about its dangers. 
Artur from Łódź has managed to get off fentanyl. A few years ago, he was so addicted, he had lost the will to live. Today, his girlfriend Agnieszka helps him stay clean. His goal: he hopes to finish his psychology degree and work as a therapist to help other addicts get off the extremely powerful drug.

Let the language wars begin.Actually, the first thing I’ll say is this: Use the tool you’re familiar with. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, use the best tool for the job. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, it’s Ok to use a tool for one task just because you’re already using it for all sorts of other tasks and therefore you happen to have it at hand. If you’re hammering nails all day it’s Ok if you’re also using your hammer to open a bottle of beer or scratch your back. Similarly, if you’re programming in Python all day it’s Ok if you’re also using it to fit mixed linear models. If it works for you, great! Keep going. But if you’re struggling, if things seem more difficult than they ought to be, this article series may be for you.Thanks for reading Genes, Minds, Machines! This post is public so feel free to share it.Let’s begin with my lived experience, without providing any explanation for what may be the cause of it. I have been running a research lab in computational biology for over two decades. During this time I have worked with around thirty graduate students and postdocs, all very competent and accomplished computational scientists. The policy in my lab is that everybody is free to use whatever programming language and tools they want to use. I don’t tell people what to do. And more often than not, people choose Python as their programming language of choice.No matter the cause of this experience, I have to conclude that there is something fundamentally broken with how data analysis works in Python. It may be a problem with the language itself, or merely a limitation of the available software libraries, or a combination thereof, but whatever it is, its effects are real and I see them routinely. In fact, I have another example, in case you’re tempted to counter, “It’s a skill issue; get better students.” Last fall, I co-taught a class on AI models for biology with an experienced data scientist who does all his work in Python. He knows NumPy and pandas and matplotlib like the back of his hand. In the class, I covered all the theory, and he covered the in-class exercises in Python. So I got to see an expert in Python working through a range of examples. And my reaction to the code examples frequently was, “Why does it have to be so complicated?” So many times, I felt that things that would be just a few lines of simple R code turned out to be quite a bit longer and fairly convoluted. I definitely could not have written that code without extensive studying and completely rewiring my brain in terms of what programming patterns to use. It felt very alien, but not in the form of “wow, this is so alien but also so elegant” but rather “wow, this is so alien and weird and cumbersome.” And again, I don’t think this is because my colleague is not very good at what he’s doing. He is extremely good. The problem appears to be in the fundamental architecture of the tools.Data science as I define it here involves a lot of interactive exploration of data and quick one-off analyses or experiments. Therefore, any language suitable for data science has to be interpreted, usable in an interactive shell or in a notebook format. This also means performance considerations are secondary. When you want to do a quick linear regression on some data you’re working with, you don’t care whether the task is going to take 50 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds. You care about whether you can open up a shell, type a few lines of code, and get the result in a minute or two, versus having to set up a new project, writing all the boilerplate to make the compiler happy, and then spend more time compiling your code than running it.who have used it extensively have doubts.Before continuing, let me provide a few more thoughts about performance. Performance usually trades off with other features of a language. In simplistic terms, performance comes at the cost of either extra overhead for the programmer (as in Rust) or increased risk of obscure bugs (as in C) or both. For data science applications, I consider a high risk of obscure bugs or incorrect results as not acceptable, and I also think convenience for the programmer is more important than raw performance. Computers are fast and thinking hurts. I’d rather spend less mental energy on telling the computer what to do and wait a little longer for the results. So the easier a language makes my job for me, the better. If I am really performance-limited in some analysis, I can always rewrite that particular part of the analysis in Rust, once I know exactly what I’m doing and what computations I need.penguins from the Palmer Archipelago.Here is the relevant code in R, using the tidyverse approach:library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |>
  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) |>
  group_by(species, island) |>
  summarize(
    body_weight_mean = mean(body_mass_g),
    body_weight_sd = sd(body_mass_g)
  )And here is the equivalent code in Python, using the pandas package:import pandas as pd
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()

(penguins
 .dropna(subset=['body_mass_g'])
 .groupby(['species', 'island'])
 .agg(
     body_weight_mean=('body_mass_g', 'mean'),
     body_weight_sd=('body_mass_g', 'std')
 )
 .reset_index()
)These two examples are quite similar. At this level of complexity of the analysis, Python does fine. I would consider the R code to be slightly easier to read (notice how many quotes and brackets the Python code needs), but the differences are minor. In both cases, we take the penguins dataset, remove the penguins for which body weight is missing, then specify that we want to perform the computation separately on every combination of penguin species and island, and then calculate the means and standard deviations.Contrast this with equivalent code that is full of logistics, where I’m using only basic Python language features and no special data wrangling package:from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
import math

penguins = load_penguins()

# Convert DataFrame to list of dictionaries
penguins_list = penguins.to_dict('records')

# Filter out rows where body_mass_g is missing
filtered = [row for row in penguins_list if not math.isnan(row['body_mass_g'])]

# Group by species and island
groups = {}
for row in filtered:
    key = (row['species'], row['island'])
    if key not in groups:
        groups[key] = []
    groups[key].append(row['body_mass_g'])

# Calculate mean and standard deviation for each group
results = []
for (species, island), values in groups.items():
    n = len(values)
    
    # Calculate mean
    mean = sum(values) / n
    
    # Calculate standard deviation
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in values) / (n - 1)
    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)
    
    results.append({
        'species': species,
        'island': island,
        'body_weight_mean': mean,
        'body_weight_sd': std_dev
    })

# Sort results to match order used by pandas
results.sort(key=lambda x: (x['species'], x['island']))

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['species']:10} {result['island']:10} "
          f"Mean: {result['body_weight_mean']:7.2f} g, "
          f"SD: {result['body_weight_sd']:6.2f} g")I will end things here for now. This post is long enough. In future installments, I’ll go over specific issues that make data analysis more complicated in Python than in R. In brief, I believe there are several reasons why Python code often devolves into dealing with data logistics. As much as the programmer may try to avoid logistics and stick to high-level conceptual programming patterns, either the language itself or the available libraries get in the way and tend to thwart those efforts. I will go into details soon. Stay tuned.LLMs excel at programming—how can they be so bad at it?Despite the overall hype in all things AI, in particular among the tech crowd, we have not yet seen much in terms of product–market fit and genuine commercial success for AIs—or more specifically, LLMs—outside a fairly narrow range of application areas.

Today, Orion for macOS officially leaves its beta phase behind and joins our iOS and iPadOS apps as a fully‑fledged, production‑ready browser.While doing so, it expands Kagi’s ecosystem of privacy-respecting, user-centric products (that we have begun fondly naming “Kagiverse”) to now include: Search, Assistant, Browser, Translate, News with more to come.We built Orion for people who feel that modern browsing has drifted too far from serving the user. This is our invitation to browse beyond ✴︎ the status quo.The obvious question is: why  do we need a new browser? The world already has Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and a growing list of “AI browsers.” Why add yet another?Because something fundamental has been lost.Zero telemetry, privacy‑first access to the internet: a basic human right.Your browser is the most intimate tool you have on your computer. It sees everything you read, everything you search, everything you type. Do you want that relationship funded by advertisers, or by you?With ad‑funded browsers and AI overlays, your activity is a gold mine. Every click becomes a way to track, every page another opportunity to profile you a little more deeply. We believe there needs to be a different path: a browser that answers only to its user.Orion is our attempt at that browser. No trade-offs between features and privacy. It’s fast, customizable, and uncompromising on both fronts.A bold technical choice: WebKit, not another Chromium cloneIn a world dominated by Chromium, choosing a rendering engine is an act of resistance.From day one, we made the deliberate choice to build Orion on , the open‑source engine at the heart of Safari and the broader Apple ecosystem. It gives us:A high‑performance engine that is deeply optimized for macOS and iOS.An alternative to the growing Chromium monoculture.A foundation that is not controlled by an advertising giant.Orion may feel familiar if you’re used to Safari – respecting your muscle memory and the aesthetics of macOS and iOS – but it is an entirely different beast under the hood. We combined native WebKit speed with a completely new approach to extensions, privacy, and customization.Speed by nature, privacy by defaultMost people switch browsers for one reason: .Orion is designed to be fast by nature, not just in benchmarks, but in how it feels every day:A lean, native codebase without ad‑tech bloat.Optimized startup, tab switching, and page rendering.A UI that gets out of your way and gives you more screen real estate for content.Alongside speed, we treat privacy as a first‑class feature:: We don’t collect usage data. No analytics, no identifiers, no tracking.No ad or tracking technology baked in: Orion is not funded by ads, so there is no incentive to follow you around the web.: Strong content blocking and privacy defaults from the first launch.Thoughtful AI, security firstWe are excited about what AI can do for search, browsing, and productivity. Kagi, the company behind Orion, has been experimenting with AI‑powered tools for years while staying true to our AI integration philosophy.But we are also watching a worrying trend: AI agents are being rushed directly into the browser core, with deep access to everything you do online – and sometimes even to your local machine.Security researchers have already documented serious issues in early AI browsers and “agentic” browser features:Prompt‑injection attacks that trick AI agents into ignoring safety rules, visiting malicious sites, or leaking sensitive information beyond what traditional browser sandboxes were designed to protect.Broader concerns that some implementations are effectively “lighting everything on fire” by expanding the browser’s attack surface and data flows in ways users don’t fully understand.We are not against AI, and we are conscious of its limitations. We already integrate with AI‑powered services wherever it makes functional sense and will continue to expand those capabilities.We are against rushing insecure, always‑on agents into the browser core. Your browser should be a secure gateway, not an unvetted co‑pilot wired into everything you do.Orion ships with  in its core.We focus on providing a clean, predictable environment, especially for enterprises and privacy‑conscious professionals.Orion is designed to connect seamlessly to the AI tools you choose – soon including Kagi’s intelligent features – while keeping a clear separation between your browser and any external AI agents.As AI matures and security models improve, we’ll continue to evaluate thoughtful, user‑controlled ways to bring AI into your workflow without compromising safety, privacy or user choice.Simple for everyone, limitless for expertsWe designed Orion to bridge the gap between simplicity and power. Out of the box, it’s a clean, intuitive browser for anyone. Under the hood, it’s a deep toolbox for people who live in their browser all day.Some of the unique features you’ll find in Orion 1.0:: Instantly transform any website into a distraction‑free web app. Perfect for documentation, writing, or web apps you run all day.
: Peek at content from any app – email, notes, chat – without fully committing to opening a tab, keeping your workspace tidy.Mini Toolbar, Overflow Menu, and Page Tweak: Fine‑tune each page’s appearance and controls, so the web adapts to you, not the other way around.: Isolate your work, personal, and hobby browsing into completely separate profiles, each with its own extensions, cookies, and settings.For power users, we’ve added granular options throughout the browser. These are there when you want them, and out of your way when you don’t.Orion 1.0 also reflects six years of feedback from early adopters. Many invisible improvements – tab stability, memory behavior, complex web app compatibility – are a direct result of people pushing Orion hard in their daily workflows and telling us what broke.Browse Beyond ✴︎: our new signatureWith this release, we are introducing our new signature: .We originally started with the browser name ‘Kagi.’ On February 3, 2020, Vlad suggested a shortlist for rebranding: Comet, Core, Blaze, and Orion. We chose Orion not just for the name itself, but because it perfectly captured our drive for exploration and curiosity. It was a natural fit that set the stage for everything that followed.You’ll see this reflected in our refreshed visual identity:A star (✴︎) motif throughout our communication.A refined logo that now uses the same typeface as Kagi, creating a clear visual bond between our browser and our search engine.Orion is part of the broader , united by a simple idea: the internet should be built for people, not advertisers or any other third parties.Small team, sustainable modelOrion is built by a team of just six developers.To put that in perspective:That’s roughly 10% of the size of the “small” browser teams at larger companies.And a rounding error compared to the teams behind Chrome or Edge.Yet, the impact is real: over 1 million downloads to date, and a dedicated community of 2480 paid subscribers who make this independence possible.For the first two years, development was carried out by a single developer. Today, we are a tight knit group operating close to our users. We listen, debate, and implement fixes proposed directly by our community on OrionFeedback.org.This is our only source of decision making, rather than any usage analytics or patterns, because remember, Orion is zero-telemetry!This small team approach lets us move quickly, stay focused, and avoid the bloat or hype that often comes with scale.Orion is free for everyone.Every user also receives 200 free Kagi searches, with no account or sign‑up required. It’s our way of introducing you to fast, ad‑free, privacy‑respecting search from day one.But we are also 100% self‑funded. We don’t sell your data and we don’t take money from advertisers, which means we rely directly on our users to sustain the project.Tip Jar (from the app): A simple way to say “thank you” without any commitment.Supporter Subscription: $5/month or $50/year.Lifetime Access: A one‑time payment of $150 for life.Supporters (via subscription or lifetime purchase) unlock a set of  perks available today, including:Floating windows: Keep a video or window on top of other apps.Customization: Programmable buttons and custom application icons.Early access to new, supporter‑exclusive features we’re already building for next year.By supporting Orion, you’re not just funding a browser – you are co‑funding a better web with humans at the center.Orion 1.0 is just the beginning. Our goal is simple: Browse Beyond, everywhere.

We have officially started development on Orion for Windows, with a target release scheduled for . Our goal is full parity with Orion 1.0 for macOS, including synchronized profiles and Orion+ benefits across platforms. Sign up for our newsletter to follow development and join the early testing wave.Synchronization will work seamlessly across devices, so your browsing experience follows you, not the other way around.From early testers to privacy advocates and power users, Orion has grown through the voices of its community.We’ll continue to surface community stories and feedback as Orion evolves. If you share your experience publicly, there’s a good chance we’ll see it.Hitting v1.0 is a big milestone, but we’re just getting started.Over the next year, our roadmap is densely packed with:Deeper customization options for power users.Further improvements to stability and complex web app performance.New Orion+ features that push what a browser can do while keeping it simple for everyone else.Tighter integrations with Kagi’s intelligent tools – always under your control, never forced into your workflow.We’re also working on expanding and improving our website to better showcase everything Orion can do, including better documentation and onboarding for teams that want to standardize on Orion.Thank you for choosing to  with us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Relational Foundation Models: Unlocking the Next Frontier of Enterprise AI // Jure Leskovec // #348</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Relational-Foundation-Models-Unlocking-the-Next-Frontier-of-Enterprise-AI--Jure-Leskovec--348-e3bf03u</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/111689278/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-10-25%2F413142419-44100-2-ffeed768dfb92.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:15:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is the Chief Scientist at Kumo.AI and a Stanford professor, working on relational foundation models and graph-transformer systems that bring enterprise databases into the foundation-model era.Relational Foundation Models: Unlocking the Next Frontier of Enterprise AI // MLOps Podcast #348 with Jure Leskovec, Professor and Chief Scientist, Stanford University and Kumo.AI.Today’s foundation models excel at text and images—but they miss the relationships that define how the world works.

In the days since, it has become the most-discussed interview we've done in three years on the show. Listeners who wrote in to us said they were shocked to hear the leader of a platform with 151.5 million monthly users, most of them minors, express frustration and annoyance at being asked about the company's history of failures related to child safety. Journalists described the interview as "bizarre," "unhinged," and a "car crash." And a case can be made that it was all of those things — even if Baszucki, in the studio afterwards and later on X, insisted to us that he had had a good time. In the moment, though, Baszucki's dismissive attitude toward discussing child safety struck me as something worse: familiar.Baszucki, after all, is not the first CEO to have insisted to me that a platform's problems are smaller than I am making them out to be. Nor is he the first to blame the platform's enormous scale, or to try to change the subject. (He is the first tech CEO to suggest to me that maybe there should be prediction markets in video games for children, but that's another story.)What people found noteworthy about our interview, I think, was the fresh evidence that our most successful tech CEOs really do think and talk this way. Given a chance to display empathy for the victims of crimes his platform enabled, or to convey regret about historical safety lapses, or even just to gesture at some sense of responsibility for the hundreds of millions of children who in various ways are depending on him, the CEO throws up his hands and asks: how long are you guys going to be going on about all this stuff? Roblox is different from other social products in that it explicitly courts users as young as 5. (You are supposed to be at least 13 to use Instagram, TikTok, and other major platforms.) That has always put significant pressure on the company to develop serious safety features. The company says it spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on safety, and that 10 percent of its employees work on trust and safety issues. And trust and safety workers I know tell me that they respect Roblox's safety teams.At the same time, this is a platform launched in 2006 where, for most of its history, adults could freely approach and message any minor unless their parents had dug into the app settings. Roblox did not verify users' ages, letting any child identify as 13 or older to bypass content restrictions. Filters intended to prevent inappropriate chat or the exchange of personal information were easily bypassed by slightly changing the spelling of words. Parental controls could be circumvented simply by a child creating a new account and declaring that they were at least 13.Last year the company introduced new restrictions on chat. And this year, the company said it would deploy its own age estimation technology to determine users' ages and restrict the content available to them accordingly. This rollout was the main reason we had sought to interview Baszucki in the first place — something we had communicated to his team.Which only made it stranger when Baszucki expressed surprise at our line of inquiry and threw his PR team under the bus. ("If our PR people said, “Let’s talk about age-gating for an hour,' I’m up for it, but I love your pod. I thought I came here to talk about everything,'" he said.)Since 2018, at least two dozen people in the United States have been arrested and accused of abducting or abusing victims they met on Roblox, according to a 2024 investigation by Bloomberg. Attorneys general in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana have filed lawsuits against Roblox alleging that the platform facilitates child exploitation and grooming. More than 35 families have filed lawsuits against the company over child predation.As recently as this month, a reporter for the  created an account presenting herself as a child and found that in Roblox she could wander user-created strip clubs, casinos, and horror games. In one "hangout" game, in which she identified as a 13-year-old, another avatar sexually assaulted her by thrusting his hips into her avatar's face as she begged him to leave her alone.It's true that any platform that lets strangers communicate will lead to real-world harm. I believe that millions of children use Roblox daily without incident. And we would not want to shut down the entire internet to prevent a single bad thing from ever happening. But there is much a leader can do with the knowledge that his platform will inevitably lead to harm, should he wish. Understanding how attractive Roblox would be to predators, the company long ago could have blocked unrestricted contact between adults and minors. It could have adopted age verification before a wave of state legislation signaled that it would soon become mandatory anyway. It could have made it harder for children under 13 to create new accounts, and require them to get parental consent in a way it could verify.But doing so would require Roblox to focus on outcomes for children, at the likely expense of growth. And so here we are.Galling? Yes. But like I said: it's also familiar. Over and over again, we have seen leaders in Baszucki's position choose growth over guardrails. Safety features come out years after the need for them is identified, if at all. Internal critics are sidelined, laid off, or managed out. And when journalists ask, politely but insistently, why so many of their users are suffering, executives laugh and tell us that we're the crazy ones.Look at OpenAI, where the company is reckoning with the fact that making its models less sycophantic has been worse for user engagement — and is building new features to turn the engagement dial back up.Look at TikTok, which has answered concerns that short-form video is worsening academic performance for children with new "digital well-being features" that include an affirmation journal, a "background sound generator aimed at improving the mental health of its users," and "new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens." Answering concerns that teens are using the app too much with more reasons to use the app.Or look at Meta, where new court filings from over the weekend allege ... a truly staggering number of things. To name a few: the company "stalled internal efforts to prevent child predators from contacting minors for years due to growth concerns," according to Jeff Horwitz in Reuters; "recognized that optimizing its products to increase teen engagement resulted in serving them more harmful content, but did so anyway"; and gave users 17 attempts to traffic people for sex before banning their accounts. (Meta denies the allegations, which are drawn from internal documents that have not been made public; Meta has also objected to unsealing the documents.) Lawsuits will always contain the most salacious allegations lawyers can find, of course. But what struck me about these latest filings is not the lawyers' predictably self-serving framing but rather the quotes from Meta's own employees.When the company declined to publish internal research from 2019 which showed that no longer looking at Facebook and Instagram improved users' mental health, one employee said: "If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak ... is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”When Meta researchers found that by 2018, approximately 40 percent of children ages 9 to 12 were daily Instagram users — despite the fact that you are supposed to be 13 to join — some employees bristled at what they perceived as tacit encouragement from executives to accelerate growth efforts among children. "Oh good, we’re going after <13 year olds now?” one wrote, as cited in 's account of the brief. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.” When Meta studied the potential of its products to be addictive in 2018, it found that 55 percent of 20,000 surveyed users showed at least some signs of "problematic use." When it published that research the following year, though, it redefined "problematic use" to include only the most severe cases — 3.1 percent of users. “Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” a user experience researcher wrote, the company should “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”You will not be surprised to learn that the company did not alert people to the issue. As usual, the rank-and-file employees are doing their job. Over and over again, though, their boss' boss tells them to stop.Americans have short attention spans — and lots to worry about. The tech backlash that kicked off in 2017 inspired platforms to make meaningful and effective investments in content moderation, cybersecurity, platform integrity, and other teams that worked to protect their user bases. Imperfect as these efforts were, they bolstered my sense that tech platforms were susceptible to pressure from the public, from lawmakers and from journalists. They acted slowly, and incompletely, but at least they acted.Fast forward to today and the bargain no longer holds. Platforms do whatever the president of the United States tells them to do, and very little else. Shame, that once-great regulator of social norms and executive behavior, has all but disappeared from public life. In its place is denial, defiance, and the noxious vice signaling of the investor class.I'm still reckoning with what it means to do journalism in a world where the truth can barely hold anyone's attention — much less hold a platform accountable, in any real sense of that word. I'm rethinking how to cover tech policy at a time when it is being made by whim. I'm noticing the degree to which platforms wish to be judged only by their stated intentions, and almost never on the outcomes of anyone who uses them. In the meantime the platforms hurtle onward, pitching ever-more fantastical visions of the future while seeming barely interested in stewarding the present.For the moment, I'm grateful that a car-crash interview drew attention to one CEO's exasperation with being asked about that. But the real problem isn't that David Baszucki talks this way. It's that so many of his peers do, too.Unknown number calling? It’s not random…The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking.One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. The disturbing truth?Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. They buy your data from brokers.Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. It’s phishing, impersonation, and identity theft.That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and continue to erase data as new risks appear. Black Friday deal: Try Incogni here and get 55% off your subscription with code Trump backs down on AI preemption Facing criticism from both parties, the  administration backed down from issuing an executive order that would have effectively placed a moratorium on state AI regulations, .The order would have fought state regulations by withholding federal funding and establishing an “AI Litigation Task Force” to “challenge State AI laws.”Last week we  the draft executive order and how Trump’s attempts to squash state AI regulation have drawn bipartisan backlash — and made Republicans increasingly more sympathetic to the views of AI safety advocates.It's always hard to guess when Trump's instinct to do as he pleases will be thwarted by political opposition. In this case, though, the revived moratorium had little support outside the David Sacks wing of the party. And so — for now, anyway — it fell apart. State lawmakers are fighting the moratorium proposal Trump made to Congress. Today, a letter  by 280 state lawmakers urged Congress to “reject any provision that overrides state and local AI legislation.”A moratorium would threaten existing laws that “strengthen consumer transparency, guide responsible government procurement, protect patients, and support artists and creators,” the letter said.On the other side of the debate, the tech-funded industry PAC Leading the Future announced a $10 million campaign to push Congress to pass national AI regulations that would supersede state law.  X’s "About This Account" meltdownOn Friday,  debuted its  feature globally in a rollout that descended into chaos over the feature’s accidental uncovering of foreign actors behind popular right-wing accounts that actively share news on US politics. X users can now see the date an account joined the platform, how many times it has changed its username, and most importantly, the country or region it’s based in. The move,  X head of product , “is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.”But the feature has had an unintended consequence: it revealed that big pro-Trump accounts like , a right-wing user with nearly 400,000 followers that regularly shares news about US politics, aren't actually based in the US. MAGANationX, for example, is based in , according to X. Other popular right-wing accounts — that use names from the Trump family — like (1 million followers before it was suspended),  (nearly 600,000 followers), and  (more than 11,000 followers), appear to be based in , Eastern Europe, and  respectively. The data could be skewed by travel, VPNs, or old IP addresses, and some have complained their location is inaccurate. Bier said the rollout has “a few rough edges” that will be resolved by Tuesday. One of ’s promises during the takeover of Twitter was to purge the platform of inauthentic accounts. But several studies  that suspected inauthentic activity has remained at about the same levels. X has long struggled with troll farms spreading misinformation, boosted by its tendency to monetarily reward engagement. Accusations of foreign actors spreading fake news flew on both sides of the aisle. When the feature appeared to be pulled for a short period of time, Republican Gov.  of Florida  “X needs to reinstate county-of-origin — it helps expose the grift.” In a  that garnered 3.2 million views,  attached a screenshot of ’s profile, which shows the account’s based in India: “BREAKING: American guy is not actually an American guy.”“When an American billionaire offers money to people from relatively poor countries for riling up and radicalising Americans, it's not surprising that they'll take up the offer,”  in a post that garnered nearly 700,000 views. In perhaps the most devastating consequence of the feature,  said they “spent 2 years acting mysterious over what country I live in just for Elon to fuck it all up with a single update” in a  that has 4.3 million views and 90,000 likes. How President  right-wing trolls and AI memes.

From a report: Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells. Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we "peak." They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life. The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience -- but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death. 

Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others -- but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: Teaching Ethnography to Software Engineers (11/25/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/11-25-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:02:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, November 25, 2025?By @hackernoon-courses [ 10 Min read ] Meet the expert faculty behind the HackerNoon Blogging Fellowship and learn how their mentorship helps writers grow, gain authority, and master modern content.

--

The kola nut is the seed of the kola tree, a small evergreen native to the forests of West Africa, where it’s long been integral to the cultural fabric of many communities. So, how did this sacred ingredient end up all around the world? And how did it make its way into the original recipe of a drink that billions of people consume every day? Shantel George explores the bitter history of kola nuts.

I have recommended it to plenty of people since, because it is one of the most accessible programmes I've found to help writers improve.15+ years of experience in journalism and editorial leadership, spanning roles at The Wall Street Journal, S&P Global, MT Newswires, CryptoSlate, and HackerNoon, Zaeem has built deep expertise in breaking news, financial and business reporting, team management, and data-driven editorial strategy.10+ years spanning developer relations, fintech growth, and software engineering, Adebola has scaled teams from 5 to 70+, driven $5M+ in loan disbursements, built Web3/AI developer ecosystems at Tezos and Alloy, and delivered impactful technical advocacy, tools, and content that fueled multimillion-dollar pipelines.Celine Aju is a Project Manager and learning designer focused on building inclusive systems that help people thrive.

My favorite part was the biweekly workshops, where writers shared their processes—these sessions expanded my perspective, introduced me to new styles, and helped me design a writing process I’m proud of.

I was mentored by the almighty Limarc (former VP of Editorial). We would go over my work together, as He gives comments and recommendation; that is not something you get so frequently in many internship programs. An highlighte was ranking for certain keywords and having my content ranked even among giants in the industry. I left the program msot confident that I was ready for the world, and indeed I was and I am. One thing I'd say, is that the mentors are willing, and it is only the degree of efforts that people put into this that they'd get back. So, I encourage participants to put their best efforts.Grace is a software developer and technical writer addicted to books and her love for baking.

    ============If we check the “Grid” devtools, we see that this is a 4x2 grid, with the header spanning the first two rows:In order for this to work  subgrid, every grid participant has to be a direct child of the  container. Sure enough, if we inspect the HTML, we see the following structure:Semantically, this feels a bit  to me. I feel like these images should be grouped in a list, since we’re displaying a  of portfolio pieces. Proper semantic markup will provide more context to folks using assistive technologies like screen readers, and to search engines that are trying to make sense of our page.Unfortunately, adding this extra markup throws a wrench into the grid:=My Portfolio

      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.
    ============Instead of having each image occupy its own grid cell, we instead cram the entire list of images into a single cell in the second column, leaving the final two columns totally empty. 😬CSS subgrid allows us to extend the parent grid through that  tag, so that the images can participate in the main grid. Here’s what that looks like:
  .grid 
  .grid  / 
  .grid =My Portfolio

      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.
    ============There’s a lot going on here, so let’s unpack it.Using  and , we assign the  to span three columns and two rows. This is how we specify  of the grid we want to share with the ’s descendants. We’ll dig more into this later.Next, we apply  to the , to create a new child grid.Finally, we pass along the row/column definitions using  and . The  keyword is the key bit of magic that ties the two grids together, allowing each  to occupy its own cell in the parent grid.When I first learned about subgrid, this is the sort of scenario I was imagining: cases where nested HTML elements like  +  or  +  block us from assigning the actual UI elements to the grid. CSS subgrid  a nifty lil’ escape hatch for these types of situations!That said, it's not like we haven’t had other ways to solve these kinds of problems. Instead of sharing a single CSS grid template with subgrid, we could instead combine a Flexbox row with a nested grid:
  .wrapper 
    .grid =My Portfolio
      A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved.
    
      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.
    =======Instead of trying to rig everything up to use a single grid structure, we can often create the same layout with nested combinations of Flexbox/Grid. And honestly, I think I prefer this approach in this case! It feels simpler to me.But like I said earlier, this isn’t the most exciting use case for subgrid. Now that we’ve covered the basic syntax, we can explore some of the more interesting possibilities. 😄Sticking with the artist portfolio example, let’s suppose we have this card design:I created this render for the Animation Design module in my upcoming course,Whimsical. The fish is a nod to Bret Victor’s talk, “Stop Drawing Dead Fish”, which is referenced in the course.This looks alright on its own, but something funky happens when we put it in a grid:
  .grid 
  .grid ====Bret’s Dead Fish
        I created this render for the Animation Design module in my
        upcoming course,
        ==Whimsical Animations. The fish is a nod to Bret Victor’s talk, “Stop Drawing Dead
        Fish”, which is referenced in the course.
      ===Big Shoes To Fill
        In this piece, I tried to create my own sneaker design, taking
        inspiration from the Air Force Ones I’ve been wearing for most of
        my adult life. Topographically, shoes are a really weird shape, so
        this was a good challenge!
      ===Guitar Pedalboard
        Over the past few years, I’ve been getting back into music
        production, and have started collecting effect pedals. This render
        is my attempt to create my own pedal designs. The middle one is
        meant to look a bit like Zoidberg.
      ===Infinite Supercomputer
        I spent more time than I’d care to admit creating an enormous
        machine in Blender, full of weird knobs and sliders and extras. The
        goal was to produce a completely ridiculous cockpit-style panel.
      Notice that the images are different widths? The fish image, for example, is much wider than the final supercomputer image. What’s going on here? 🤔Well, let’s take a look at the CSS. The four cards are arranged in a two-column grid (which shrinks to a one-column grid on smaller screens):We’re populating this top-level grid with four  cards. Each card declares its own two-column grid:The goal here is for the image to take up the lion’s share of the space within each card, since that’s the important part (the point of an artist’s portfolio, after all, is to showcase the art!). But the  unit is designed to be flexible; it will  to match the requested ratio, but it’ll adapt based on the content.This is actually a very good thing. We  force the image column to be a fixed size, but we wouldn’t like the results:

        goal was to produce a completely ridiculous cockpit-style panel.
      On certain viewport sizes, the cards simply aren’t large enough to devote ⅔rds of the available space to the image  still contain the text content. If we force that column to have a fixed size, the text could wind up overflowing:So, the flexibility we get from the  unit is a good thing. The problem is that each card is doing its own internal calculation. The heading in the first card (“Bret’s Dead Fish”) is made up of small words, so it can fit comfortably in a narrow column. But the final card’s heading (“Infinite Supercomputer”) requires quite a bit more room.If you’ve worked with CSS for a while, you’ve probably gotten stuck in cul-de-sacs like this. One of the hardest problems in CSS is when  need to be aware of each other inside nested / complex layouts.Miraculously, subgrid offers a solution to these sorts of problems. Check this out:

      In the original version, the parent grid was a one-column layout (on smaller screens), and it contained a bunch of independent grids. In this new version, the  grid holds the two-column layout:In the original version, the parent grid was a two-column layout, with each card assigned to a grid cell. In this new version, the parent grid grows to  columns:Each  will span two of these columns (), and inherits the column definitions from the parent (grid-template-column: subgrid).As a result, the grid can dynamically react to content changes. Try erasing the word “Supercomputer” in the playground above and notice how the columns readjust!As a result, the grid can dynamically react to content changes. If that final card (“Infinite Supercomputer”) had a shorter title, the whole grid would rearrange, shrinking the text columns and allowing more of the images to be shown.Honestly, I’m not really used to thinking about layouts like this. Before subgrid, I would’ve solved this problem by picking a very narrow fixed width for the image column, so that there was always enough space for the text column. This would ensure that the layout never breaks, but remember, the goal of a portfolio is to display as much of the images as possible! Subgrid allows us to adapt to the content dynamically, so that we can produce the best possible UI in various contexts.This is where subgrid truly shines, in my opinion. By extending the grid downwards, it means that we can allow siblings to become responsive to each other, in a way that hasn’t been possible until now. ✨As I’ve been experimenting with subgrid, there have been a couple of things that have caught me off guard. Let’s go over them, so that you’re well-prepared!Sharing  with subgrid tends to be pretty intuitive, but things get a bit more quirky when sharing .To help me explain, let’s look at a different example. Suppose our design team wants us to build the following pricing UI, to show the features included at different price tiers:This  like a pretty straightforward task, but the devil is in the details. If we use a typical Grid or Flexbox strategy, we’ll wind up with asymmetrical rows:This might  right at a quick glance, but notice how the features don’t line up. In the original mockup, the first line of every feature is perfectly aligned with the same feature in the opposite card!Historically, the only way to achieve this sort of thing in CSS has been with Table layout (using  tags, or ). It’s not really practical to use a table here, though, since we’d need each card to be its own column in the same table, and we can’t easily style table columns. At least in theory, we should be able to let both cards share a single grid, like this:Unfortunately, there’s a very easy mistake to make. See if you can spot the problem with this code:
  .grid 

    .card .card ==Pro PackageUp to 4 team accounts.Basic workflows.Connect with Slack™.Up to 3 knowledge bases, with 100gb total storage.Limited AI assistant (depending on region and language).=Enterprise PackageUnlimited team accounts.Advanced, fully-customizeable workflows.Connect with Slack™, Microsoft Teams™, Discord™, and 5 other popular integrations.Unlimited knowledge bases.Unlimited robots. 🤖All of the text is clumped up in the same spot! If we inspect this using the Grid devtools, we discover that we’ve wound up with a 2×1 grid. All of the content within each card is smushed into a single row. 😬Typically, with CSS Grid, we don’t need to explicitly define any rows. I usually define the number of , and trust the grid algorithm to add new rows as-needed, so that each child gets its own grid cell.Unfortunately, with subgrid, it doesn't quite work like this. By default, our child grid will only span a single grid column/row. If we want it to occupy  rows, we need to reserve them explicitly.Here’s what the fix looks like:
  .grid 

    .card 
    .card ==Pro PackageUp to 4 team accounts.Basic workflows.Connect with Slack™.Up to 3 knowledge bases, with 100gb total storage.Limited AI assistant (depending on region and language).=Enterprise PackageUnlimited team accounts.Advanced, fully-customizeable workflows.Connect with Slack™, Microsoft Teams™, Discord™, and 5 other popular integrations.Unlimited knowledge bases.Unlimited robots. 🤖The extra-complicated thing about this setup is that we’re extending the grid down  layers:First, we extend it to , which includes an  and a .Next, we extend it to that child , so that the individual list items each get their own row.There are 5 list items in this case, which means we need 6 rows total (one for the heading, five for the list). If we don’t “reserve” all of these rows explicitly, then the browser will shove everything into a single row and make a big mess, like we saw above. I’m not exactly sure  the typical auto-assignment algorithm doesn’t work with subgrid, but I assume there’s some technical limitation.This is mind-bending stuff, but it becomes intuitive with a bit of practice. The thing to keep in mind is that subgrids, by default, will only occupy a single grid cell. In order to spread a group of items across multiple grid rows, the subgrid must first stretch across that area itself.We got the gnarliest gotcha out of the way first! I promise the next two won’t be as intellectually taxing. 😅In CSS grid, the lines between each column are numbered, and we can assign grid children using these numbers. This is something we explore in greater depth in “An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid”:When we inherit a portion of the grid using grid-template-rows: subgrid or grid-template-columns: subgrid, the line numbers get reset.Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:
  .grid 

    .subgrid  /  / 

      .child ===Our yellow  is assigned to  and , but it winds up sitting in the  of the grid’s four rows and columns. 🤔It turns out that while the grid  is inherited with subgrid, the  don’t. Our  grid inherits columns/rows 2 through 4, but internally, they get re-indexed as 1 through 3.We can see this using the grid devtools in the Elements inspector:In my mind, I had been thinking of line numbers as unique IDs, and so I figured that if the subgrid is inheriting the grid template, those IDs would come along for the ride too. But if we think of these line numbers as  rather than IDs, this behaviour makes a lot more sense. In every grid, the first line has index 1, even if that row/column is inherited from a parent grid.Perhaps the most famous grid snippet is this lil’ guy:This is a  concept. Instead of specifying different grid templates at different viewport sizes using media queries, we specify that we want as many columns as possible, as long as they’re all at least 100px wide (or whatever the minimum specified size is).Try resizing the “Result” pane by dragging the vertical divider, and notice how the columns adjust:
  .grid ==A=B=C=D=E=FThis is a very cool approach, but unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work with some of the new UI possibilities introduced by subgrid. For example, the “portfolio card” grid we explored earlier requires that we list the specific number of columns. We can’t use  or .Subgrid has been supported across all major browsers since 2023. Surprisingly, though, subgrid support still hasn’t hit 90% yet (according to, as of November 2025).This presents a bit of a challenge. As we’ve seen in this blog post, subgrid enables us to solve problems that were previously unsolvable. What should we do for folks who visit using older browsers?Well, we can’t produce an  experience, but I think with a bit of creative problem-solving, we can come up with alternative layouts that are . Using the artist portfolio example from earlier, we could reconfigure the card layout so that the image is stacked vertically, rather than horizontally:We can accomplish this using feature queries. Here’s what the code looks like:Alternatively, I could have kept the two-column layout but restricted the image column’s width (eg. grid-template-columns: 50px 1fr). This would’ve preserved the original design for everyone. But I think when it comes to fallbacks, the goal isn't to be as similar to the original as possible, the goal is to produce the best experience possible. In this particular case, I think a single-column fallback experience works better.I’m publishing this post on November 25th, a frankly miserable time of year up here in the northern hemisphere 😅. The days are getting shorter, the weather is getting colder, and my favourite season (autumn) is transmogrifying into my least favourite season (winter).But there is one silver lining about this time of year: everything’s on sale for Black Friday! 🎈If you found this blog post useful, you’ll likely get  out of my CSS course. We focus on understanding CSS at a deeper level, building an intuition for how the language actually works. No more memorizing snippets, or trying random stuff hoping that the UI will snap into the right shape!I know that in the world of e-commerce, things go on sale every other week. That’s not how I roll, though. I only have one or two sales a year. So this truly is a rare chance to pick up one of my courses for a deep discount. ✨If we pop open the grid devtools, we see that the  is one big grid, passed down through several layers of subgrids:This is incredibly cool, and I think it’s a great demonstration of the maximalist things we can do with subgrid. But, honestly, I think I’m more excited by the smaller-scale stuff we’ve seen in this blog post. 😅Subgrid is a very versatile new tool, and it can be a bit intimidating and overwhelming, but hopefully this post has given you some ideas for the sorts of things you can start experimenting with. The good news is that you don’t have to re-architect your entire project in order to start using subgrid! The most powerful parts of subgrid are things which can be incrementally adopted.Another special thanks to Kevin Powell. The examples in this blog post would’ve been far less compelling without his inspiration. 😄]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bloomberg Surveillance 11/25/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s_Chhajt10</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1s_Chhajt10?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:52:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowicz and Annmarie Hordern speak daily with leaders and decision makers from Wall Street to Washington and beyond.

It generates high-quality images while maintaining character and style consistency across multiple reference images, following structured prompts, reading and writing complex text, adhering to brand guidelines, and reliably handling lighting, layouts, and logos. FLUX.2 can edit images at up to 4 megapixels while preserving detail and coherence.Black Forest Labs: Open CoreWe believe visual intelligence should be shaped by researchers, creatives, and developers everywhere, not just a few. That’s why we pair frontier capability with open research and open innovation, releasing powerful, inspectable, and composable open-weight models for the community, alongside robust, production-ready endpoints for teams that need scale, reliability, and customization.When we launched Black Forest Labs in 2024, we set out to make open innovation sustainable, building on our experience developing some of the world’s most popular open models. We’ve combined open models like FLUX.1 [dev]—the most popular open image model globally—with professional-grade models like FLUX.1 Kontext [pro], which powers teams from Adobe to Meta and beyond. Our open core approach drives experimentation, invites scrutiny, lowers costs, and ensures that we can keep sharing open technology from the Black Forest and the Bay into the world.Precision, efficiency, control, extreme realism - where FLUX.1 showed the potential of media models as powerful creative tools, FLUX.2 shows how frontier capability can transform production workflows. By radically changing the economics of generation, FLUX.2 will become an indispensable part of our creative infrastructure.: FLUX.2 is capable of generating highly detailed, photoreal images along with infographics with complex typography, all at resolutions up to 4MPAll variants of FLUX.2 offer image editing from text and multiple references in one model.The FLUX.2 family covers a spectrum of model products, from fully managed, production-ready APIs to open-weight checkpoints developers can run themselves. The overview graph below shows how FLUX.2 [pro], FLUX.2 [flex], FLUX.2 [dev], and FLUX.2 [klein] balance performance, and controlGenerating designs with variable steps: FLUX.2 [flex] provides a “steps” parameter, trading off typography accuracy and latency. From left to right: 6 steps, 20 steps, 50 steps.Controlling image detail with variable steps: FLUX.2 [flex] provides a “steps” parameter, trading off image detail and latency. From left to right: 6 steps, 20 steps, 50 steps.The FLUX.2 model family delivers state-of-the-art image generation quality at extremely competitive prices, offering the best value across performance tiers.For open-weights image models, FLUX.2 [dev] sets a new standard, achieving leading performance across text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing, consistently outperforming all open-weights alternatives by a significant margin.Whether open or closed, we are committed to the responsible development of these models and services before, during, and after every release.FLUX.2 builds on a latent flow matching architecture, and combines image generation and editing in a single architecture. The model couples the Mistral-3 24B parameter vision-language model with a rectified flow transformer. The VLM brings real world knowledge and contextual understanding, while the transformer captures spatial relationships, material properties, and compositional logic that earlier architectures could not render.FLUX.2 now provides multi-reference support, with the ability to combine up to 10 images into a novel output, an output resolution of up to 4MP, substantially better prompt adherence and world knowledge, and significantly improved typography. We re-trained the model’s latent space from scratch to achieve better learnability and higher image quality at the same time, a step towards solving the “Learnability-Quality-Compression” trilemma. Technical details can be found in the FLUX.2 VAE blog post.We're building foundational infrastructure for visual intelligence, technology that transforms how the world is seen and understood. FLUX.2 is a step closer to multimodal models that unify perception, generation, memory, and reasoning, in an open and transparent way.Join us on this journey. We're hiring in Freiburg (HQ) and San Francisco. .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Improved Upstream Kernel Support For TUXEDO Laptops Being Worked On</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Uniwill-TUXEDO-Add-On-Patches</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:47:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While TUXEDO Computers recently ended their efforts for a Snapdragon X Elite Linux laptop, their Linux Intel/AMD laptop efforts continue going well and recently they have been posting patches working to enhance the upstream kernel support for those x86_64 devices...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine backs ‘essence’ of new Russia war peace deal</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/ukraine-backs-essence-of-new-russia-war-peace-deal</link><author>Anja Popp</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:44:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia and Ukraine traded deadly drone strikes as talks continue in the hopes of striking a peace deal and ending their three-year long war.US President Donald Trump’s initial 28-point peace plan, largely seen as heavily favouring Russia, was rejected by Ukraine and European allies but Ukraine is expressing hope of finding a new agreement.Russian officials say three people were killed in Ukrainian strikes overnight in the Rostov region and a Russian attack in Kyiv reportedly killed at least six.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sluggish car market: Which EU countries are bucking the trend?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbklrDbrYRs</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sbklrDbrYRs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:40:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Some countries are experiencing a mini-boom in the automobile industry thanks to state incentives, despite modest consumer demand.

Nearly 90% of presales never release a working product on time.  is different. Its V1 of the protocol is planned for Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, making the token highly attractive for pre-launch investors seeking real utility. This confirmed timeline separates MUTM from other presales and creates a unique opportunity for crypto investing enthusiasts searching for the next crypto to buy now.Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale highlights the urgency. The total supply is 4 billion MUTM, with over $18.95 million raised across all phases and there are more than 18,200 holders. The current price sits at $0.035, Phase 6 allocation of 170 million MUTM is 95% sold, and the next presale price will rise to $0.040. Recently, card purchases are now enabled with no limits, making entry easier than ever. Investors are acting fast as Phase 6 nears full allocation, signaling strong demand and limited time to secure tokens before the price increase.A numerical example demonstrates the potential. An investor who purchased $6,000 in Phase 4 at $0.025 acquired 240,000 MUTM. At today’s price of $0.035, the investment is already valued around $8,400. Once MUTM reaches $1, the same stack will grow to $240,000, illustrating how early participation aligns with long-term gains.Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a new digital lending infrastructure designed to maximize token utility. The platform will combine transparent mechanics with a working DeFi product in development. MUTM is not just a token; it will drive real activity through lending, borrowing, and staking features. The pre-launch stage allows investors to acquire tokens ahead of the platform’s full functionality, capturing early-stage upside while the ecosystem grows.The platform offers two lending models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending uses liquidity pools where users receive mtTokens representing their positions. Borrowing options are tracked with debt tokens, while a liquidator bot maintains protocol safety. ETH and USDT are the initial supported assets, ensuring stable liquidity and predictable lending outcomes. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending allows lenders and borrowers to negotiate loans directly, which is ideal for more volatile tokens. P2P offers higher returns for lenders, creating an attractive mechanism for investors seeking yield beyond traditional DeFi channels.Why the V1 Timeline is a Game Changer and Other Growth FactorsMutuum Finance (MUTM) announced through its official X account that the V1 edition of its protocol is  on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This first rollout will activate the platform’s essential components, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token frameworks, and an automated liquidator bot designed to protect collateral positions and maintain system stability. During this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and provide ETH or USDT as collateral within the protocol.Introducing V1 on the testnet grants the community early access to the platform before its mainnet expansion. This structured release promotes transparency, encourages initial user engagement, and enables the team to gather meaningful feedback for ongoing improvements. As more participants explore the testnet and interact with its features, overall interest in the ecosystem may grow, supporting stronger long-term confidence in the MUTM token.Later on, the platform is expected to launch simultaneously with the token launch, generating immediate utility, allowing lending, borrowing, and staking from day one.A working product will also attract attention from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges, increasing visibility and accelerating adoption. For investors, this timeline provides clarity and confidence rarely seen in presales, reinforcing MUTM’s position as a leading choice for crypto investing.Future expansion includes a decentralized $1-pegged stablecoin. Users will be able to borrow against ETH, SOL, and AVAX, with over-collateralized designs ensuring stability. Minting and repaying this stablecoin will increase MUTM usage, creating ongoing demand and enhancing the ecosystem’s long-term value. The stablecoin mechanism aligns with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s goal to maintain utility-driven growth, giving early investors a tangible pathway to returns.The platform will also include a buyback and dividend logic. Part of the lending revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens, which will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This mechanism generates continuous buy pressure, supporting token appreciation while rewarding long-term participants. The system grows stronger as adoption increases, reinforcing a self-sustaining cycle that enhances both utility and value.Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an active and growing community with over 12,000 Twitter followers. Daily rewards of $500 in MUTM further incentivize engagement.The platform is also running an , where 10 winners will receive $10,000 in MUTMs each, generating excitement and promoting widespread participation.Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the few presales with a fully confirmed product timeline. The V1 Testnet will launch on Sepolia in Q4 2025, and the platform and token will go live together, offering immediate utility and active token use. Phase 6 is almost sold out, and the price will increase from $0.035 to $0.040, creating a final window for investors. With confirmed development, utility, staking rewards, stablecoin expansion, and buyback mechanisms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents an unmatched opportunity for investors seeking the next crypto to buy now. Urgency is high, and the time to participate in this presale is limited.For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below::::tip

More expensive MLC and SLC NAND can hold data for five and ten years respectively. The voltage loss can result in missing data or completely unusable drives. 

Hard drives remain more resistant to power loss despite their susceptibility to bit rot. Most users relying on SSDs for primary storage in regularly powered computers face little risk since drives typically stay unpowered for only a few months at most. The concern mainly affects creative professionals and researchers who need long-term archival storage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spotify to raise US prices in first quarter of next year, report says</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/spotify-to-raise-us-prices-in-first-quarter-of-next-year-report-says/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:15:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Snow Forecast (2025/11/25)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oc8twMpBO4</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7oc8twMpBO4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:13:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Snow Forecast (2025/11/25)

Trees are among the most extreme and successful forms of life on Earth. They build their bodies from thin air, move water with pressures that would crush a human, and grow using a fascinating system of living cables wrapped in layers of corpses. Under their bark lies a razor-thin strip of living cells, working endlessly to move water hundreds of meters, build indestructible wood, and coordinate millions of functions. 
How do trees work, and what are they even made of? What makes these ancient giants so resilient, and maybe even immortal?

The result is a winnowed-down, 19-point plan, according to people familiar with the matter. While Trump struck a positive tone on the prospects for a ceasefire, officials in Russia called the revised European plan a non-starter. Bloomberg's Oliver Crook reports.

But we’re hoping to learn a bit more so we can figure out how people are discovering our work, what our readers do, and what other projects people might want us to launch in the future. If you want to cut to the chase: here is a link to our very short survey we would really, really appreciate you filling out. You can do it anonymously and it should take around a minute. If you want to know more on the , please read below!As we said, Ghost doesn’t collect much data about our readers. The little info we do have shows broadly that most of our readers are in the U.S., followed by Europe, etc. But we don’t have a great idea of how people first learn about 404 Media. Or whether people would prefer a different format to our daily newsletter. Or what industries or academic circles our readers are in.This information is useful for two main reasons: the first is we can figure out how people prefer to read us and come across our work. Is it via email? Is it articles posted to the website? Or the podcast? Do more people on Mastodon read us, or on Bluesky? This information can help us understand how to get our journalism in front of more people. In turn, that helps inform more people about what we cover, and hopefully can lead to more people supporting our journalism.The second is for improving the static advertisements in our email newsletters and podcasts that we show to free members. If it turns out we have a lot of people who read us in the world of cybersecurity, maybe it would be better if we ran ads that were actually related to that, for example. Because we don’t track our readers, we really have no idea what products or advertisements would actually be of interest to them. So, you voluntarily and anonymously telling us a bit about yourself in the survey would be a great help.Here is . There is also a section for any more general feedback you have. Please help us out with a minute of your time, if you can, so we can keep growing 404 Media sustainably and figure out what other projects readers may be interested in (such as a physical magazine perhaps?).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>inDrive’s Approach to Measuring Engineering Performance</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/indrives-approach-to-measuring-engineering-performance?source=rss</link><author>inDrive.Tech</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:41:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[inDrive is a ride-hailing company operating in 48 countries with a unique peer-to-peer pricing model that enables fair trip costs. Across all products, more than 600 engineers work in 70+ teams.Understanding why organizations need this is essential. The main reason is that today’s market has changed. Companies now want more control and better efficiency from what they already have - their processes, people, and tools. This becomes especially important when scaling, since hiring more people alone is no longer a sustainable way to grow.And if we want to answer these hard questions, we need to define and manage metrics that help achieve the organization’s specific goals. It’s important to note that at inDrive,  is one of our core values - alongside . That’s why performance isn’t just about results; it’s part of who we are as a company. We strive to understand impact and create it at every level of the organization.We identified several key factors that led us to develop our own approach to performance:Since 2020, the company has been experiencing rapid business and engineering growth in both the number of engineers and teams.This scale creates the need for  that ensure predictable outcomes and support sustainable scaling.Leadership must rely on  to understand how teams perform within these processes, identify bottlenecks, and make informed managerial decisions.Finally, metrics must be aligned with strategic and operational goals - only then do they become drivers of meaningful progress rather than isolated statistics.It’s important to note that performance and productivity are closely connected. Productivity reflects how effectively your delivery processes work, while performance shows what outcomes they actually produce. Different companies interpret these terms and approach metric design in very different ways. Some focus mainly on individual contributor productivity, while others track metrics only at the . But I believe this complex challenge requires building a  that operates across all levels of the organization.At inDrive, I implemented a system that includes:Metrics, integrated into the tech metrics tree, which is divided into domains and levels. We’ve defined five domains - such as cost efficiency, people metrics, performance, operational and engineering excellence and each level corresponds to the company’s organizational structure: from the  (the entire tech division) to the  (teams united by a shared product or domain expertise), Team leve,l and individual contributor level. At the cluster and team levels, performance and operational efficiency are further refined into more specific areas - such as predictability, speed, maturity, and quality:The example below shows how a metric within the Performance domain cascades across different levels:: each metric has an  - a subject-matter expert responsible for defining the methodology and leading the implementation of new processes and metrics. In addition,  are accountable for performance within their teams, clusters, or division. For us, it’s essential that metrics are part of a , not delegated to dedicated roles like Agile Coaches, Service Delivery Managers, or Project Managers. Only this way can we achieve systemic and sustainable results., which enable teams at every level to systematically analyze the current state, make data-driven management decisions, and drive change across the company - through the year strategy, technology programs or joint initiatives. For example, a few years ago we launched an engineering satisfaction survey in response to metric signals that revealed issues with delivery performance. Today, beyond being a standalone metric, it has become one of our  - helping us identify and drive the changes needed to improve the efficiency of our internal processes and tools, especially those owned by .: to support this system, we have built the  - a Tableau-based dashboard ecosystem that connects all metrics and data sources into the tech metrics tree, serving as the single source of truth for performance across teams, clusters and the entire division.The Single Analytical SystemThe concept behind the Single Analytical System is straightforward - it’s a set of dashboards that bring together metrics from multiple sources (Jira, Grafana, Kibana, PagerDuty, HR systems or in-house tools) into a single one-pager view. In other words, you have a pocket-sized overview of the entire landscape. And when deeper analysis is needed, you jump directly to the underlying data source, such as a detailed dashboard in Grafana. To implement the dashboards, I designed a five-tier structure: from the division level down to the sandbox. Each tier can have its own dashboard or a family of dashboards, enabling performance analysis of a specific organizational entity or providing a cross-team or cross-service view of a particular metric.Includes key technology metrics aligned with company and divisional strategy across five domains:: cost per ride, lost money, etc.: turnover, engagement, satisfaction, etc.: mobile performance, availability, security, data quality.: DORA metrics, technical debt, etc.: time to market, lead time, completion rate, etc.One of the dashboard sections looks as follows:All metrics are shown in  to track trends over time, with  indicating whether each metric has reached its target value or not.The dashboard allows CTO and divisional leadership to assess efficiency, identify focus areas, and understand the influence of specific clusters. at this level includes all  organized within the previously defined :: goals progress, scope drop.: lead time, velocity, time to market.: incidents, SLA postmortems, security error budgets.: team maturity index: cycle time (lead time for changes), deployment frequency, change failure rate, mean time to restore.Used by Directors of Engineering/Product and CTO to improve performance and other company-wide processes such as Annual Performance Review.  Metrics are usually analyzed monthly during cluster metrics analysis.Mirrors the cluster level but with team-specific context:Predictability: sprint goal success, goals progress, scope drop.Speed: lead time, velocity, time to market.Quality: incidents, SLA outcomes, security budgets.Maturity: team maturity indexEngineering Excellence: cycle time (lead time for changes), deployment frequency, change failure rate, mean time to restore.I designed  and metrics to work for any team - whether they use Scrum or Kanban. This makes the system flexible while keeping the evaluation consistent.This is the  for Engineering managers for supporting data-driven planning, stakeholder alignment, and continuous improvement during both day-to-day operations and key events like sprint planning or retrospectives.4. Individual Contributor LevelThe dashboard includes engineer-level productivity data in five key areas, such as collaboration,  work quality, workload health, development experience and AI adoption.Used by Engineering managers during day-to-day work to maintain a high level of productivity and identify growth areas.Contains deep-dive dashboards for SMEs managing specific metrics across the organization: enabling advanced analysis and experimentation. For example, Time-to-market or team maturity level.Used by SMEs or any managers on demand for deep-dive analysis.Building a system that allows organizations to manage, evaluate, and improve engineering performance is crucial - it enables data-driven understanding of the current state and helps launch  at multiple levels.At the same time, we recognize the inherent risks of over-reliance on metrics - they can be misinterpreted or gamified. As part of the Engineering Excellence Team, I promote the mindset that  - they are  to guide management decisions. Metrics may miss context, reflect short-term fluctuations, or mislead without proper analysis. Their real value lies in comprehensive, contextual evaluation, enabling managers to answer key questions during planning, reviews, and performance discussions, and to foster a data-driven culture grounded in accountability and learning.Staff Coach, Engineering Excellence Team]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Came Out of Trump&apos;s Calls With Xi and Takaichi</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC6euLlFmFU</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EC6euLlFmFU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:39:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump held back-to-back calls with the leaders of China and Japan, signaling his desire to balance ties with Asia's top economies as tensions rise over a Taiwan feud.

We’re building an open-source chat that works with any LLM (proprietary + open weight)  gives these LLMs the tools they need to be useful (RAG, web search, MCP, deep research, memory, etc.).Two years ago, Yuhong and I had the same recurring problem. We were on growing teams and it was ridiculously difficult to find the right information across our docs, Slack, meeting notes, etc. Existing solutions required sending out our company's data, lacked customization, and frankly didn't work well. So, we started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built to be self-hosted and easily customized.As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors, indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team with a secure way to use them”.Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions exist?”As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:(1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI(2) providing this  is much harder than you might think and the bar is incredibly highConsumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a great experience—and chat with AI for work is something (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI with:- (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI tools for the first time.- Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.- RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it work for larger enterprises.Through building features like deep research and code interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the comments).First, context management is one of the most difficult and important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the very end of the context window, so this placement gives the highest likelihood of adherence.Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()` around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare line.So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+ employees access to every model within a single interface, and create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>APT Rust requirement raises questions</title><link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1046841/5bbf1fc049a18947/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:18:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
           By November 24, 2025It is rarely newsworthy when a project or package picks up a new
dependency. However, changes in a core tool like Debian's Advanced Package
Tool (APT) can have far-reaching effects. For example, Julian
Andres Klode's declaration
that APT would require Rust in May 2026 means that a few of Debian's
unofficial ports must either acquire a working Rust toolchain or
depend on an old version of APT. This has raised several questions
within the project, particularly about the ability of a single
maintainer to make changes that have widespread impact.On October 31, Klode sent an announcement to the debian-devel
mailing list that he intended to introduce Rust dependencies and code
into APT as soon as May 2026:This extends at first to the Rust compiler and standard library, and
the Sequoia ecosystem.In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the HTTP
signature verification code would strongly benefit from memory safe
languages and a stronger approach to unit testing.If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.Klode added this was necessary so that the project as a whole could
move forward, rely on modern technologies, "and not be held back by
trying to shoehorn modern software on retro computing
devices". Some Debian developers have welcomed the news. Paul
Tagliamonte acknowledged
that it would impact unofficial Debian ports but called the push
toward Rust "".However, John Paul Adrian Glaubitz complained
that Klode's wording was unpleasant and that the approach was
confrontational. In another
message, he explained that he was not against adoption of Rust; he
had worked on enabling Rust on many of the Debian architectures and
helped to fix architecture-specific bugs in the Rust toolchain as well
as LLVM upstream. However, the message strongly suggested there was no room
for a change in plan: Klode had ended his message with "thank you for
understanding", which invited no further discussion. Glaubitz was
one of a few Debian developers who expressed discomfort with Klode's
communication style in the message.Klode noted,
briefly, that Rust was already a hard requirement for all Debian
release architectures and ports, except for Alpha (alpha), Motorola 680x0 (m68k),
PA-RISC (hppa), and
SuperH (sh4), because of
APT's use of the Sequoia-PGP
project's  tool to
verify OpenPGP
signatures. APT falls back to using the GNU Privacy Guard
signature-verification tool, , on
ports that do not have a Rust compiler. By depending directly on Rust,
though, APT itself would not be available on ports without a Rust
compiler. LWN recently
covered the state of Linux architecture support, and the status of
Rust support for each one.No AI slop, all substance: subscribe to LWN today

None of the ports listed by Klode are among those officially
supported by Debian today, or targeted for support in
Debian 14 ("forky"). The sh4 port has never been officially
supported, and none of the other ports have been supported since
Debian 6.0. The actual impact on the ports lacking Rust is also
less dramatic than it sounded at first. Glaubitz assured
Antoni Boucher that "the ultimatum that Julian set doesn't really
exist", but phrasing it that way "gets more attention in the
news". Boucher is the maintainer of ,
a GCC
ahead-of-time code generator for Rust. Nothing, Glaubitz said,
stops ports from using a non-Rust version of APT until Boucher and
others manage to bootstrap Rust for those ports.David Kalnischkies, who is also a major
contributor to APT, suggested
that if the goal is to reduce bugs, it would be better to remove the
code that is used to parse the .deb, .ar, and .tar formats that Klode
mentioned from APT entirely. It is only needed for two tools, 
and ,
he said, and the only "" of
 was by Klode's employer, Canonical, for its Launchpad software-collaboration
platform. If those were taken out of the main APT code base, then it
would not matter whether they were written in Rust, Python, or another
language, since the tools are not directly necessary for any given
port.Kalnischkies also questioned the claim that Rust was necessary to
achieve the stronger approach to unit testing that Klode mentioned:You can certainly do unit tests in C++, we do. The main problem is
that someone has to write those tests. Like docs.Your new solver e.g. has none (apart from our preexisting integration
tests). You don't seriously claim that is because of C++ ?
If you don't like GoogleTest, which is what we currently have,
I could suggest doctest (as I did in previous installments).
Plenty other frameworks exist with similar or different styles.Klode has not responded to those comments yet, which is a bit
unfortunate given the fact that introducing hard dependencies on
Rust has an impact beyond his own work on APT. It may well be that he
has good answers to the questions, but it can also give the
impression that Klode is simply embracing a trend toward Rust. He is involved
in the Ubuntu work to migrate from GNU Coreutils to the Rust-based uutils. The reasons given for that work, again, are around
modernization and better security—but security is not automatically 
guaranteed simply by switching to Rust, and there are a number of
other considerations.For example, Adrian Bunk pointed
out that there are a number of Debian teams, as well as tooling,
that will be impacted by writing some of APT in Rust. The release
notes for Debian 13 ("trixie") mention
that Debian's infrastructure "currently has problems with
rebuilding packages of types that systematically use static
linking", such as those with code written in Go and Rust. Thus, "these packages will be
covered by limited security support until the infrastructure is
improved to deal with them maintainably". Limited security support
means that updates to Rust libraries are likely to only be released
when Debian publishes a point release, which happens about every two
months. The security team has specifically
stated that  is fully supported, but there are still
outstanding problems.Due to the static-linking issue, any time one of 's
dependencies, currently more than 40 Rust crates, have to be rebuilt
due to a security issue,  (at least potentially) also
needs to be rebuilt. There are also difficulties in tracking CVEs for
all of its dependencies, and understanding when a security
vulnerability in a Rust crate may require updating a Rust program that
depends on it.Fabian Grünbichler, a maintainer of Debian's Rust toolchain, listed
several outstanding problems Debian has with dealing with Rust
packages. One of the largest is the need for a consistent Debian policy for declaring
statically linked libraries. In 2022, Guillem Jover added a control
field for Debian packages called Static-Built-Using (SBU), which would list
the source packages used to build a binary package. This would
indicate when a binary package needs to be rebuilt due to an update in
another source package. For example,  depends on more than
40 Rust crates that are packaged for Debian. Without declaring the
SBUs, it may not be clear if  needs to be updated when one
of its dependencies is updated. Debian has been working on a policy
requirement for SBU since April 2024, but it is not yet finished
or adopted.The discussion sparked by Grünbichler makes clear that most of
Debian's Rust-related problems are in the process of being
solved. However, there's no evidence that Klode explored the problems
before declaring that APT would depend on Rust, or even asked "is this
a reasonable time frame to introduce this dependency?"Where tradition meets tomorrowDebian's tagline, or at least one of its taglines, is "the
universal operating system", meaning that the project aims to run on a
wide variety of hardware (old and new) and be usable on the desktop,
server, IoT devices, and more. The "Why Debian" page
lists a number of reasons users and developers should choose the
distribution: multiple hardware
architectures, long-term
support, and its democratic governance
structure are just a few of the arguments it puts forward in favor
of Debian. It also notes that "Debian cannot be controlled by a
single company". A single developer employed by a company to work
on Debian tools pushing a change that seems beneficial to that
company, without discussion or debate, that impacts multiple hardware
architectures and that requires other volunteers to do unplanned work
or meet an artificial deadline seems to go against many of the
project's stated values.Debian, of course, does have checks and balances that could be
employed if other Debian developers feel it necessary. Someone could,
for example, appeal to Debian's Technical Committee,
or sponsor a general resolution to override a developer if they cannot
be persuaded by discussion alone. That happened recently when the committee required systemd
maintainers to provide the  directory "until
a satisfactory migration of impacted software has occurred and Policy
updated accordingly".However, it also seems fair to point out that Debian can move
slowly, even glacially, at times. APT added
support for the DEB822
format for its source information lists in 2015. Despite APT
supporting that format for years, Klode faced resistance in 2021, when
he pushed
for Debian to move to the new format ahead of the Debian 12
("bookworm") release in 2021, but was unsuccessful. It is now the
default for trixie with the move to APT 3.0, though APT
will continue to support the old format for years to come.The fact is, regardless of what Klode does with APT, more and more
free software is being written (or rewritten) in Rust. Making it
easier to support that software when it is packaged for Debian is to
everyone's benefit. Perhaps the project needs some developers who will
be aggressive about pushing the project to move more quickly in
improving its support for Rust. However, what is really needed is more
developers lending a hand to do the work that is needed to support
Rust in Debian and elsewhere, such as . It does not
seem in keeping with Debian's community focus for a single developer
to simply declare dependencies that other volunteers will have to
scramble to support.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU must ‘stand by the promises made’ on digital rules, Vestager tells Euronews</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQYjuoN5ft0</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YQYjuoN5ft0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:15:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EU must ‘stand by the promises made’ on digital rules, Vestager tells Euronews

They’re meant to block bots and make websites safer. But cybercriminals have started using deceptive versions. They’re fake CAPTCHAs that trick users into installing malware or giving away private data.What begins as a harmless-looking verification ends up being a gateway for crypto theft, credential harvesting, or system compromise. So, we’ll explore how those fake CAPTCHAs work, the risks they pose to your crypto, and most importantly, steps you can take to defend yourself.How the Fake Captcha Scam WorksA fake CAPTCHA is crafted to look like a normal verification step, but behind the scenes, the attackers are executing a malicious plan. You click “I’m not a robot,” and the page quietly copies a command into your clipboard. Then it prompts you to paste it somewhere (often the Windows Run box) and press Enter. That simple command  like Lumma Stealer or the Amadey Trojan, which harvest passwords, browser cookies, crypto wallet keys, and more. Not even a proper download is needed.\
Researchers have observed this tactic being embedded into  across different industries, sometimes via ads or via third-party scripts on otherwise legitimate domains. The attack often uses fileless execution, which means the malware doesn’t leave a noticeable trace on disk, making detection trickier.Once inside, the malware scans for browser-saved credentials, cookie data, two-factor tokens, and wallet files, and can quietly exfiltrate what it finds. The Amadey Trojan, in particular, also acts as a clipper: it detects crypto addresses already copied on the clipboard, and then replaces them with ones controlled by the hackers. This way, when you paste the address to send funds, it may not be your intended destination.It might sound technical, but the key is that the CAPTCHA prompt acts as a lure: you believe you’re just verifying you’re human, and don’t see what’s really happening behind.  that in some tests, 17% of users exposed to a fake CAPTCHA campaign ended up following the instructions that triggered malware. \n Why the “I’m Not a Robot” Trick is So EffectiveFake CAPTCHAs work so well because they exploit a ritual we’ve all learned to trust. Clicking a box or selecting traffic lights feels routine, something safe and familiar. That habit makes users lower their guard. Attackers count on this automatic behavior. They mimic Google’s design style and use the same fonts and layouts.In a way, fake CAPTCHAs are the perfect  tool: they blend technical deception with psychological manipulation. People tend to associate CAPTCHAs with extra safety, just a filter that keeps bots out. That’s what makes them ideal for smuggling in the very threats they’re supposed to block. We could call this “trust hijacking”: turning a symbol of security into bait.When the malware behind these scams targets crypto users, it’s not random. Criminals follow where the money flows, and  are pure digital gold. Stealing one recovery phrase can be worth more than months of low-level phishing attempts. The trick’s elegance lies in its simplicity: a single click that feels harmless, leading straight into the attacker’s control.How to Protect Yourself from Fake Captcha AttacksWe must be careful not to assume every CAPTCHA is safe. Here are strategies to reduce risk and keep your crypto secure:Start by checking whether the website is known and trustworthy. If a CAPTCHA appears on an already suspicious site or seems oddly intrusive, exit immediately.Always verify the URL. Misspellings, extra characters, or odd domains are warning signs.Never paste commands into your system based on web prompts. No legitimate CAPTCHA ever asks you to run something manually.To avoid incidents when pasting complex crypto addresses, you can use easier , usernames,  in Obyte to send and receive funds.You can also use textcoins  to keep most of your funds offline, safe from any kind of hacking attempt.Use up-to-date antivirus or endpoint protection that can block or detect malicious scripts or PowerShell executions.Consider browser extensions or tools that block scripts or clipboard manipulation on untrusted pages.Enable strong security habits: keep your software patched,  across different wallets, and avoid storing private keys in digital form.Fake CAPTCHAs are a cunning twist in the ongoing battle between cybercriminals and everyday users. For those holding or handling crypto, the stakes are high. Stay alert, follow the protective steps above, and treat any CAPTCHA prompt outside normal activity with skepticism.:::info

It wasn’t firewalls that failed; it was trust.That’s the flaw in the old “trust but verify” model: once someone gets inside your network perimeter, they’re automatically trusted. But in today’s world — where employees log in from coffee shops, contractors access systems from personal devices, and AI makes phishing nearly indistinguishable from reality — that kind of blind trust has become attackers’ favorite weapon.And as companies wake up to that reality, it’s no surprise that the  security market is projected to surge from $42.48 billion in 2025 to $124.50 billion by 2032 (). The message is clear: companies can no longer afford blind trust.So if your business hasn’t made the shift yet, you’re not just behind; you’re gambling with survival.This article unpacks what Zero Trust really means, why it matters more than ever in 2025, and—most importantly—how to put it into practice before the next breach headline has your name on it.What Zero Trust Really Means (and What It Doesn’t)Imagine this: An employee receives an email that looks identical to one you might send. The wording feels natural, the signature is spot-on, and the message carries a sense of urgency: “Please review this document and log in quickly.”In the old perimeter-based security model, once that employee entered their credentials, the attacker would likely have free access to everything inside. That’s because the system operated on a simple assumption: if you’re “inside,” you must be trusted.Zero Trust changes that rule completely. It doesn’t matter who you are: an intern, a contractor, or even the CEO — every request has to prove itself, every time. Instead of granting blanket trust, Zero Trust requires continuous verification before giving access to data or systems.At its core, it comes down to this: never assume trust, always verify it.But just to be clear, Zero Trust is often misunderstood. It’s not:Just turning on multi-factor authenticationA shiny replacement for your VPNOr some plug-and-play tool you can buy and be done withIt’s a shift in mindset and strategy; not a single product.Core Principles of Zero Trust SecurityZero Trust isn’t a single product you switch on; it’s a framework. It’s about rethinking how access is granted, how activity is watched, and how risk is contained in a world where threats are constant and work no longer happens inside neat office walls.The framework rests on the following guiding principles:People and devices should only get the access they truly need. If your job doesn’t require pulling financial data, you shouldn’t have the keys to that system. Limiting access in this way means that if an account is ever compromised, the damage stays contained. \n Logging in once at the start of the day isn’t enough. Every request to reach data or systems has to be checked again, because trust isn’t permanent. It’s like your bank app asking you to confirm your identity not just when you log in, but also when you move money or reset your password. \n Think of the network like a building. Instead of one giant open floor plan where anyone can wander, Zero Trust breaks it into smaller rooms with separate locks. Even if an attacker slips into one room, they can’t easily move through the rest of the building. \n  Access rules alone aren’t enough. Zero Trust also means keeping watch. If a user suddenly downloads thousands of files at 2 a.m., alarms should go off before that odd behavior turns into a disaster.Together, these principles don’t make attacks vanish — nothing does. But they shrink the blast radius, so a breach doesn’t spiral into a company-wide catastrophe.One weak password. One careless click. That’s all it takes for an attacker to gain free rein inside your systems. And it’s not hypothetical; stories like this keep making headlines.In 2025, the case for Zero Trust has never been clearer.Here are four reasons why:: The average cost of a data breach this year is about $4.44 million, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report. That’s not pocket change. For many mid-sized companies, it’s enough to wipe out an entire year’s profit. Imagine being the CFO explaining that loss in the next board meeting.Zero Trust helps you soften that blow by limiting how far attackers can spread if they break in.: Hackers don’t need to break down the door anymore. With AI, they can simply impersonate someone you trust. In 2024, engineers at Arup learned this the hard way when a deepfake video call tricked staff into wiring HK$200 million (~£20 million).Zero Trust is built for exactly this scenario — where the person “inside” may not be who they claim to be. Regulators no longer want promises; they want proof. Miss the mark, and the fines can be as painful as the breach itself. Meta learned that in 2023, when it was hit with a record €1.2 billion GDPR fine. To put that in perspective, that’s larger than the annual GDP of some countries.However, with Zero Trust, you can close that gap by enforcing continuous verification and stronger governance. Trust doesn’t erode slowly anymore. One public security slip and years of goodwill can vanish overnight. In industries like finance and healthcare, customers don’t forgive; they just move to the competitor who promises stronger protection.Zero Trust helps you hold on to that fragile trust by baking verification into every interaction.Zero Trust looks simple on a slide deck, but reality is messier. Many organizations stumble when they try to turn the idea into practice. The intentions are good, but the execution is where things often fall apart.Here are five common Zero Trust adoption-mistakes to watch out for:Treating Zero Trust as a product instead of a strategy: Buying the latest tool with “Zero Trust” on the label doesn’t mean you’re done. Adoption requires changes to policies, workflows, and even company culture. The tech is just one piece of the puzzle.Applying controls unevenly: It’s common to secure remote access while leaving internal apps or legacy systems wide open. That patchwork approach creates blind spots attackers know how to find. Every system deserves the same level of scrutiny.Trying to do it all at once: Rolling out Zero Trust everywhere on day one usually backfires. A smarter play: start with your highest-risk apps or privileged accounts, prove it works, then expand step by step.Ignoring the user experience: If security feels like punishment — endless MFA prompts, clunky approvals, session timeouts — employees will look for shortcuts. And those shortcuts undo the very protections you’re trying to build. Balance security with usability.Treating Zero Trust as a one-time project: Zero Trust isn’t an install-and-walk-away project. Without audits, reviews, and updates, your defenses will fall behind. Think of it less like a one-time deployment and more like ongoing maintenance.The pattern is clear: companies run into trouble when they treat Zero Trust as a quick fix instead of a long-term shift. Avoid these traps, and the transition becomes not just manageable — but sustainable.\n Best Practices for Adopting Zero Trust SecurityRolling out Zero Trust isn’t an overnight fix. The companies that succeed start with focused steps, test what works, and scale gradually.Here’s how to approach it:Start with identity and access control: Keep permissions tight. Users and devices should only have access to what they genuinely need. Pair this with safeguards like MFA and role-based access. Since credential theft remains a top breach vector, limiting what stolen logins can access goes a long way. Not every system needs the same defense. Pinpoint your most critical assets — customer data, financials, intellectual property — and protect them first. Zero Trust works best when it shields what matters most. A wide-open network is like leaving all the office doors unlocked. Micro-segmentation creates controlled zones, so even if attackers get in, they can’t wander freely from one department or system to another.Monitor everything, all the time: Attacks don’t usually happen instantly; they build quietly. Continuous monitoring and automated alerts can flag unusual activity early — like an account suddenly downloading thousands of files.Build a culture that backs it up: Zero Trust fails if employees see it as red tape. Take time to explain why new measures, like stricter logins and access reviews matter. When people connect these steps to protecting the company and its customers, adoption gets much smoother.Zero Trust is no longer just a security trend; it’s quickly becoming the baseline for how modern businesses defend themselves. Breaches are more expensive, attackers are sharper, and regulators less forgiving. Customers, too, have little patience for excuses. The old “trust once you’re inside” model has turned into a liability.The upside? You don’t need to rip everything apart to get started with Zero Trust.  Start with clear wins — stronger identity checks, network segmentation, and employee buy-in— and you can set the foundation and grow from there.At its core, Zero Trust is about one simple shift: don’t assume, verify. In 2025, that mindset may be the difference between scrambling to recover from a breach and standing out as a company customers know they can trust.Now is the time to act. Assess your current security posture, identify your most critical assets, and take the first steps toward Zero Trust. The longer you wait, the higher the odds your organization becomes the next cautionary headline.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fear on the streets | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/l_FpOnObpK4</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/l_FpOnObpK4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:01:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Although sexual violence can affect people of all genders, women and girls are disproportionally impacted.  

Many women feel unsafe in public spaces, whether on streets, at train stations, or in parks. The danger they face overwhelmingly comes from men: Around 95% of sexualized violence in public spaces is committed by them. 

Yanni Gentsch's encounter with a stranger who secretly filmed her while she jogged in a forest in Cologne went viral on the internet after she recorded the confrontation. Her experience demonstrates a common and recurring problem.

It is a blueprint for a Trump defeat and Putin win, and that’s why it has to be changed fundamentally.”Mr Rasmussen, who served as Denmark’s PM from 2001 to 2009, said: “Europe must step forward robustly and play hard power politics, which means give robust security guarantees to Ukraine, backed up by troop presence in Ukraine, and secondly unlock frozen Russian assets for Ukraine.”While he said that he appreciated American efforts to initiate the peace process, Mr Rasmussen added: “I find it quite embarrassing that the Europeans are begging and asking for a seat at the table. We should have a seat at the table because we’re indispensable and the way to make yourself indispensable would be to bring something to the table, and that should be concrete security guarantees for Ukraine.”“Europe must step forward robustly and play hard power politics, which means give robust security guarantees to Ukraine, backed up by troop presence in Ukraine.”He told Channel 4 News those guarantees, and any US security guarantee, must involve troops in Ukraine.“The fact is that Putin doesn’t care about paper guarantees,” he said.“It’s only guarantees backed up by a concrete military presence that he will respect.”Mr Rasmussen said he estimated that Europe would need to send 20,000 troops – but he stressed that they should not be on the frontline.He told Channel 4 News that Europe should also send 150 combat aircraft, and “establish an air shield to protect these cities in Ukraine.”“The fact is that Putin doesn’t care about paper guarantees.”Asked if Europe has the assets to do this, he said yes, “but obviously the deterrent effect would be much stronger if the US would back up such a European reassurance force by intelligence sharing, space surveillance, aircraft, transport, etc.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Retail Sales Growth Slows in September, PPI Increases 0.3%</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPwZfLohEuE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oPwZfLohEuE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:56:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US retail sales rose modestly in September, as the value of retail purchases, not adjusted for inflation, increased 0.2% after a 0.6% gain in August.

An application was running on Beanstalk, but the security team flagged it as non-compliant for OS patching because the underlying servers hadn’t been updated for about a year — the Windows Update service had stopped working. An upgrade to the latest platform failed for some reason, so the team wanted to patch the EC2 instances without affecting live traffic. The goal was to avoid any interruption. I started digging into AWS Elastic Beanstalk to understand the options available to handle this.What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?It’s a service for deploying web applications and services. Elastic Beanstalk provides capacity provisioning, load balancing, autoscaling, and health monitoring. This allows you to focus on writing code.Benefits of AWS Elastic BeanstalkAmong many others, the key benefit is that one can deploy a scalable web application within minutes, as you don’t have to worry about the complexity of underlying infrastructure like configuring VPC, EC2 instances, load balancers and autoscaling policies, and so on. It also supports most major programming languages, including Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby, with full support for Docker as well. Other benefits include monitoring, health checks, logging, tracing, automatic updates, auto-scaling, and multi-AZ deployments.What does AWS Elastic Beanstalk Cost?Nothing. Yes, that’s correct, the AWS Elastic Beanstalk does not cost anything additionally. You will pay for any resources you configure to run your application, same as you would when you configure them without using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.Among many other features, the one that came to the rescue was environment cloning. It allows the developers to replicate an existing environment rapidly. Cloning environment was the solution we arrived at after evaluating other options like scaling up, building a completely new environment, or routing traffic to one region while working on the other region.How to clone environments with AWS BeanstalkEnvironment cloning can be done with the following simple steps:Open the Elastic Beanstalk console, and select the AWS Region.Choose Environments from the navigation panel and then choose the name of your environment from the list.On the environment overview page, choose Actions.Choose Clone environment.In the New Environment section, you can optionally change the Environment name, Environment URL, Description, Platform version, and Service role values that Elastic Beanstalk automatically sets based on the original environment.I cloned the environment. As it spawned new EC2 instances, they already had patches installed. After that, it was just a matter of changing the R53 entry to the domain created for the cloned environment so that the live traffic was routed to it.The original environment was left untouched to allow us to fail back in case of any issue. Once we were satisfied with the cloned environment running without any issues, we updated the original environment and started sending traffic to the original environment.AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a developer-friendly service, takes responsibility for infrastructure configuration and management. Its clone environment feature can be really handy for testing and experimenting with code running in live applications without impacting the customer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russian strikes hit Kyiv overnight | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/S4FisAafDLA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/S4FisAafDLA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:46:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deadly strikes hit Ukrainian capital Kyiv as part of a wider wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine.

This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” said Prof Duncan Astle, a researcher in neuroinformatics at Cambridge University and senior author of the study.“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”The childhood period of development was found to occur between birth until the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts up to the age of 32, on average.In a person’s early 30s the brain’s neural wiring shifts into adult mode – the longest era, lasting more than three decades. A third turning point around the age of 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.The scientists quantified brain organisation using 12 different measures, including the efficiency of the wiring, how compartmentalised it is and whether the brain relies heavily on central hubs or has a more diffuse connectivity network.From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. During this period, the study found, the efficiency of the brain’s wiring decreases.Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.In the second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, white matter continues to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined. This era is defined by steadily increasing efficiency of connections across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. The epochs were defined by the brain remaining on a constant trend of development over a sustained period, rather than staying in a fixed state throughout.“We’re definitely not saying that people in their late 20s are going to be acting like teenagers, or even that their brain looks like that of a teenager,” said Alexa Mousley, who led the research. “It’s really the pattern of change.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionShe added that the findings could give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period.At around the age of 32 the strongest overall shift in trajectory is seen. Life events such as parenthood may play a role in some of the changes seen, although the research did not explicitly test this. “We know that women who give birth, their brain changes afterwards,” said Mousley. “It’s reasonable to assume that there could be a relationship between these milestones and what’s happening in the brain.”From 32 years, the brain architecture appears to stabilise compared with previous phases, corresponding with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies. Brain regions also become more compartmentalised.The final two turning points were defined by decreases in brain connectivity, which were believed to be related to ageing and degeneration of white matter in the brain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Larry Ellison Met With Trump To Discuss Which CNN Reporters They Plan To Fire</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/25/larry-ellison-met-with-trump-to-discuss-which-cnn-reporters-they-plan-to-fire/</link><author>Karl Bode</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:30:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trump’s right wing billionaire friend Larry Ellison (and his nepobaby son, David) recently acquired CBS and likely co-ownership of TikTok. Like Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the goal isn’t really subtle: rich, thin-skinned right wingers want to own the entirety of U.S. new and old media, then convert it into a giant propaganda and lazy infotainment bullhorn that blows smoke up their asses.While Ellison has some competing suitors with names like Comcast NBC Universal and Netflix, the winning bidder will need approval from the Trump DOJ and FCC. Knowing that they likely have a distinct tactical advantage via corruption, Ellison and Trump appear to be already measuring the drapes, discussing programming changes (and CNN hirings and firings) that will please the president:“Ellison often speaks to connections at the White House and in at least one phone call engaged in a dialogue about possibly axing some of the CNN hosts whom Donald Trump is said to loathe, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar, the people said.”The great irony is these networks that offend Trump weren’t exactly what you’d call bastions of hard-nosed journalism to begin with. Under the ownership of Trump fan David Zaslav, CNN is already know for flinging softball questions at Trump authoritarians, failing to challenge obvious lies on air, and generally airing a sort of safe, infotainment-centered pseudo-journalism. But even  too much critical thinking for America’s thinnest skinned billionaires. But given the recent failures of efforts to dominate U.S. media through consolidation (again, see AT&T) it’s also equally likely that this weird assortment of trolls and nepobabies simply creates a mountain of unsustainable debt and hubris crushed by the weight of its own incompetent ambition. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Breaking the Architecture Bottleneck • Andrew Harmel-Law &amp; Marit van Dijk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BGQcTjecjM</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6BGQcTjecjM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:29:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law discusses their book "Facilitating Software Architecture" and how traditional architecture approaches often become bottlenecks that slow down high-performing development teams.

Rather than architects making top-down decisions in isolation, they advocate for a facilitation approach centered on the "advice process".

This collaborative method shifts the architect's role from decision-maker to conversation facilitator. The approach has proven successful even in traditional corporate environments, ultimately creating more maintainable code bases where development teams actually enjoy working and can respond effectively to changing requirements.

The world's biggest PC maker is holding on to component inventories that are roughly 50% higher than usual, Chief Financial Officer Winston Cheng told Bloomberg TV on Monday. The frenzy to build and fill AI data centers with advanced hardware is raising prices for producers of consumer electronics, but Lenovo also sees opportunity in this to capitalize on its stockpile.
 
"The price is going very, very high, of course, and I think it's been unprecedented in terms of this rate driven by the AI demand," Cheng said. His company has long-term contracts in place and the benefit of scale, he added, and "those that have the supply actually would be able to have a position in the market." Beijing-based Lenovo will aim to avoid passing on rising costs to its customers in the current quarter, as it wants to sustain this year's strong sales growth, according to the CFO. He said the company will strike a balance between price and availability in 2026. Lenovo said last week that it has enough memory chips for all of 2026 and it can navigate any shortages better than its competitors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anxiety mounts after mass abduction in Nigeria | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CphunlegL34</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CphunlegL34?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:46:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Christian group in Nigeria says around 50 of the more than 300 children kidnapped from a Catholic school last week have escaped and been reunited with their families.

I noted then, and it’s still true two decades later: Software failures are universally unbiased. They happen in every country, to large companies and small. They happen in commercial, nonprofit, and governmental organizations, regardless of status or reputation.Global IT spending has more than tripled in constant 2025 dollars since 2005, from US $1.7 trillion to $5.6 trillion, and continues to rise. Despite additional spending, software success rates have not markedly improved in the past two decades. The result is that the business and societal costs of failure continue to grow as software proliferates, permeating and interconnecting every aspect of our lives.For those hoping AI software tools and coding copilots will quickly make large-scale IT software projects successful, forget about it. For the foreseeable future, there are hard limits on what AI can bring to the table in controlling and managing the myriad intersections and trade-offs among systems engineering, project, financial, and business management, and especially the organizational politics involved in any large-scale software project. Few IT projects are displays of rational decision-making from which AI can or should learn. As software practitioners know, IT projects suffer from enough management hallucinations and delusions without AI adding to them.As I noted 20 years ago, the drivers of software failure frequently are failures of human imagination, unrealistic or unarticulated project goals, the inability to handle the project’s complexity, or unmanaged risks, to name a few that today still regularly cause IT failures. Numerous others go back decades, such as those identified by Stephen Andriole, the chair of business technology at Villanova University’s School of Business, in the diagram below first published in  in 2021. Uncovering a software system failure that has gone off the rails in a unique, previously undocumented manner would be surprising because the overwhelming majority of software-related failures involve avoidable, known failure-inducing factors documented in hundreds of after-action reports, academic studies, and technical and management books for decades. Failure déjà vu dominates the literature.The question is, why haven’t we applied what we have repeatedly been forced to learn?The Phoenix That Never RosePhoenix project executives believed they could deliver a modernized payment system, customizing PeopleSoft’s off-the-shelf payroll package to follow 80,000 pay rules spanning 105 collective agreements with federal public-service unions. It also was attempting to implement 34 human-resource system interfaces across 101 government agencies and departments required for sharing employee data. Further, the government’s developer team thought they could accomplish this for less than 60 percent of the vendor’s proposed budget. They’d save by removing or deferring critical payroll functions, reducing system and integration testing, decreasing the number of contractors and government staff working on the project, and forgoing vital pilot testing, along with a host of other overly optimistic proposals.Phoenix’s payroll meltdown was preordained. As a result, over the past nine years, around 70 percent of the 430,000 current and former Canadian federal government employees paid through Phoenix have endured paycheck errors. Even as recently as fiscal year 2023–2024, a third of all employees experienced paycheck mistakes. The ongoing financial stress and anxieties for thousands of employees and their families have been immeasurable. Not only are recurring paycheck troubles sapping worker morale, but in at least one documented case, a coroner blamed an employee’s suicide on the unbearable financial and emotional strain she suffered.The question is, why haven’t we applied what we have repeatedly been forced to learn?What percentage of software projects fail, and what failure means, has been an ongoing debate within the IT community stretching back decades. Without diving into the debate, it’s clear that software development remains one of the riskiest technological endeavors to undertake. Indeed, according to Bent Flyvbjerg, professor emeritus at the University of Oxford’s Saїd Business School, comprehensive data shows that not only are IT projects risky, they are  riskiest from a cost perspective.CISQ report estimates that organizations in the United States spend more than $520 billion annually supporting legacy software systems, with 70 to 75 percent of organizational IT budgets devoted to legacy maintenance. A 2024 report by services company NTT DATA found that 80 percent of organizations concede that “inadequate or outdated technology is holding back organizational progress and innovation efforts.” Furthermore, the report says that virtually all C-level executives believe legacy infrastructure thwarts their ability to respond to the market. Even so, given that the cost of replacing legacy systems is typically many multiples of the cost of supporting them, business executives hesitate to replace them until it is no longer operationally feasible or cost-effective. The other reason is a well-founded fear that replacing them will turn into a debacle like Phoenix or othersNevertheless, there have been ongoing attempts to improve software development and sustainment processes. For example, we have seen increasing adoption of iterative and incremental strategies to develop and sustain software systems through Agile approaches, DevOps methods, and other related practices.It is best to be wary of these claims while also acknowledging that successfully implementing Agile or DevOps methods takes consistent leadership, organizational discipline, patience, investment in training, and culture change. However, the same requirements have always been true when introducing any new software platform. Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices, it is not surprising that novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems, no matter how effective they may be, will also frequently fall short.Persisting in Foolish ErrorsThe frustrating and perpetual question is why basic IT project-management and governance mistakes during software development and operations continue to occur so often, given the near-total societal reliance on reliable software and an extensively documented history of failures to learn from? Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.Frustratingly, the IT community stubbornly fails to learn from prior failures. IT project managers routinely claim that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix’s case, for example, it was the government’s second payroll-system replacement attempt, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it’s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter’s “gales of creative destruction.” They’re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT project mismanagement. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995’s payroll-project fiasco? The government maintains it will learn, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure’s high political profile. But will Phoenix’s lessons extend to the thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems needing replacement or modernization? Hopefully, but hope is not a methodology, and purposeful action will be necessary.The IT community has striven mightily for decades to make the incomprehensible routine. Repeatedly making the same mistakes and expecting a different result is not learning. It is a farcical absurdity. Paraphrasing Henry Petroski in his book To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design (Vintage, 1992), we may have learned how to calculate the software failure due to risk, but we have not learned how to calculate to eliminate the failure of the mind.There are a plethora of examples of projects like Phoenix that failed in part due to bumbling management, yet it is extremely difficult to find software projects managed professionally that still failed. Finding examples of what could be termed “IT heroic failures” is like Diogenes seeking one honest man.The consequences of not learning from blunders will be much greater and more insidious as society grapples with the growing effects of artificial intelligence, or more accurately, “intelligent” algorithms embedded into software systems. Hints of what might happen if past lessons go unheeded are found in the spectacular early automated decision-making failure of Michigan’s MiDAS unemployment and Australia’s Centrelink “Robodebt” welfare systems. Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of unemployment fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and Australia placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors’ impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed “maladministration,” administrative evil is closer to reality.So, we are left with only a professional and personal obligation to reemphasize the obvious: Ask what you do know, what you should know, and how big the gap is between them before embarking on creating an IT system. If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a cybersecurity threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and systems development, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve. This not only means providing the personnel, financial resources, and leadership support and commitment, but also the professional and personal accountability they demand.It is well known that honesty, skepticism, and ethics are essential to achieving project success, yet they are often absent. Only senior management can demand they exist. For instance, honesty begins with the forthright accounting of the myriad of risks involved in any IT endeavor, not their rationalization. It is a common “secret” that it is far easier to get funding to fix a troubled software development effort than to ask for what is required up front to address the risks involved. Vendor puffery may also be legal, but that means the IT customer needs a healthy skepticism of the typically too-good-to-be-true promises vendors make. Once the contract is signed, it is too late. Furthermore, computing’s malleability, complexity, speed, low cost, and ability to reproduce and store information combine to create ethical situations that require deep reflection about computing’s consequences on individuals and society. Alas, ethical considerations have routinely lagged when technological progress and profits are to be made. This practice must change, especially as AI is routinely injected into automated systems.In the AI community, there has been a movement toward the idea of human-centered AI, meaning AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, and well-being. This means trying to anticipate where and when AI can go wrong, move to eliminate these situations, and build in ways to mitigate the effects if they do happen. This concept requires application to every IT system’s effort, not just AI.Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices...novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems...will also frequently fall short.failure after-effectssoftware crisis]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making Crash Bandicoot (2011)</title><link>https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/video-games/making-crash/</link><author>davikr</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:05:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As one of the co-creators of , I have been (slowly) writing a long series of posts on the making of everyone’s favorite orange marsupial.

Kyiv and its allies quickly hammered out a counter-proposal, which Kyiv says is 'workable'. But will the White House or the Kremlin agree to the changes? What are Ukraine's red lines? Is Russia ready to soften its hardline demands? Or will the US pressure Ukraine to accept a raw deal for peace?

Meta is in discussions to use the Google chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, The Information reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. An agreement would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia’s chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms.

US stock futures eased after a tech-fueled rally in the S&P 500, as traders look ahead to a slate of economic data to gauge whether optimism over a potential Federal Reserve interest-rate cut can hold up. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 was little changed. Asia’s regional benchmark climbed 0.6%, buoyed by gains in Chinese shares after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held their first talks since agreeing to a tariff truce last month. Traders are watching US data ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, including September retail sales and producer prices due later Tuesday.

Trump’s hour-long conversation with President Xi Jinping on Monday marked their first contact since Japan’s new prime minister enraged Beijing by suggesting her nation’s troops could be drawn into a Taiwan crisis.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the European Union needs to change its digital regulations in order to get a deal to lower steel and aluminum tariffs.

The disruption follows the Dutch government’s decision to seize control of Nexperia over national security risks tied to its Chinese parent, Wingtech. In response, China suspended exports from Nexperia’s Dongguan facility — a major source of basic chips used in automotive components. Major automakers, including Nissan and Honda, have curtailed production, while top suppliers like Bosch have reduced factory output. The halted supply of low‑end chips has led to cascading delays across the sector. Despite promises to diversify sourcing post-COVID and natural disasters, automakers remain heavily reliant on just-in-time logistics and face high switching costs for alternative chips.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>“AI Is Like a Nuclear Project” - Russia’s Vedyakhin on The Emerging National AI Arms Race</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-is-like-a-nuclear-project-russias-vedyakhin-on-the-emerging-national-ai-arms-race?source=rss</link><author>BotBeat.Tech: AI Research</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:47:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence is being likened to nuclear power by Alexander Vedyakhin, the first deputy CEO of Sberbank, who stated that a new global “AI club” is forming, where nations with their own large language models (LLMs) will gain outsized influence, as reported by Reuters on Monday.\n Vedyakhin said Russia already ranks among the seven countries that have developed home‑grown AI capabilities, and stressed that reliance on foreign‑built models poses unacceptable security risks in areas like public services, healthcare, and education.\n He acknowledged that the U.S. and China are ahead by about six to nine months, and that for countries just entering the race, the cost and energy demands make catch‑up extremely challenging.\n Despite Western sanctions limiting access to computing infrastructure, Vedyakhin said Russia will leverage its talent pool and plans to release some of its latest AI models as open source, while cautioning that over‑investment in AI infrastructure risks diminishing returns.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China Regains 14 % of Global Bitcoin Mining Share in Surprise Revival</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/china-regains-14-percent-of-global-bitcoin-mining-share-in-surprise-revival?source=rss</link><author>Crypto Sovereignty Through Technology, Math &amp; Luck</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:47:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency mining in 2021, Bitcoin mining in China has quietly rebounded, with energy‑rich provinces and surplus data‑centre infrastructure driving the resurgence, Reuters reported on Monday.\n Data from the Hashrate Index indicates China has reclaimed around 14 % of global Bitcoin mining share as of October 2025, climbing back to third place globally.\n The revival is bolstered by cheap electricity in regions like Xinjiang and strong demand for mining rigs from Chinese buyers: one major rig‑maker, Canaan Inc., reports more than 50% of its quarterly revenue now comes from China, up from 2.8% in 2022.\n Although the mining ban remains officially in place, weak enforcement and shifting policy signals suggest China may be tolerating the underground revival — highlighting the difficulty of curbing entrenched crypto activity when economic incentives are strong.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta Accused of Burying Research that Linked Facebook Usage to Teen Depression</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/meta-accused-of-burying-research-that-linked-facebook-usage-to-teen-depression?source=rss</link><author>Top Tech Companies</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:47:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Meta Platforms allegedly suppressed internal research linking its social-media products to negative mental-health outcomes, according to U.S. court filings reported by Reuters on Nov. 24.\n The filings reveal a 2020 study, code‑named “Project Mercury,” in which users who deactivated Facebook reported lower levels of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison.\n Rather than publish the results, Meta halted the research, internally attributing the findings to a “media narrative,” even as a staffer privately insisted that the evidence was valid. \n Meta said the study was stopped due to methodological flaws and maintains it has long engaged in research and actions to protect teens.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Protesters in India demand cleaner air | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/60N3366clCU</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/60N3366clCU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:45:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Protests in New Delhi calling for more government action to tackle air pollution were met with police crackdown.

The meme of “it runs Doom” has become so widespread that it spawned the r/itrunsdoom sub-Reddit.Recently, Doom made headlines again for being ported to TypeScript. The project involved representing Doom entirely in TypeScript, three and a half trillion lines of types, 90 GB of RAM to run, and a full year to complete.Dimitri Mitropoulos is the engineer who carried out this heroic feat.

The Washington Post reports: This month, the agency approved two new pesticides that meet the internationally recognized definition for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or fluorinated substances, and has announced plans for four additional approvals. The authorized pesticides, cyclobutrifluram and isocycloseram, which was approved Thursday, will be used on vegetables such as romaine lettuce, broccoli and potatoes. The agency also announced plans to relax a rule requiring companies to report all products containing PFAS and has proposed weakening drinking water standards for the chemicals. "Many fluorinated compounds registered or proposed for U.S. pesticidal use in recent years offer unique benefits for farmers, users, and the public," EPA spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.
 
"It is important to differentiate between the highly toxic PFAS such as PFOA and PFOS for which the EPA has set drinking water standards, versus less toxic PFAS in pesticides that help maintain food security," notes Doug Van Hoewyk, a toxicologist at Maine's Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. He added that concerns about food residue depend on the PFAS and the quantity.
 
Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity, also commented: "The data we have about the use of PFAS pesticides is already seven years old, and since there have been many new approvals during that time, those numbers are sure to underestimate the amount were using today."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Six killed in overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv and Sumy amid renewed US efforts to end the fighting</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9pKCkSkihQ</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z9pKCkSkihQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 09:51:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Six killed in overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv and Sumy amid renewed US efforts to end the fighting

They’re losing because they hesitate. Intelligence often works against you: the more aware you are of the risks, the more likely you are to freeze. Smart people convince themselves that hesitation is strategy, but it’s usually fear disguised as logic. You’ve probably talked yourself out of more opportunities than the world ever took from you. You tell yourself, , I need to learn a bit more, I’ll start when it feels right. But that feeling never comes. The people you call reckless started before they were ready, and that’s exactly why they learned faster than you did. You believe there’s an invisible threshold where you finally become “qualified.” You picture a line where you’ll magically feel ready to start the podcast, pitch the client, post the video. That line doesn’t exist. There are no gatekeepers. The only permission slip is the one you sign yourself. Intelligence creates self-doubt. The smarter you are, the more flaws you see. You’re painfully aware of how far you are from mastery, and that awareness becomes a weight you carry everywhere. You see the cracks in your own work and assume everyone else sees them too. The truth: they don’t. They’re too busy looking at their own. You measure yourself against experts who have been at it for a decade, not beginners who just started. You scroll through polished results and forget how ugly the early versions were. Dumb people don’t have that problem, they compare themselves only to their previous attempt. That’s why they improve faster. That’s the Dunning-Kruger effect in motion. People who know little overestimate themselves, and people who know a lot underestimate themselves. The irony is brutal: the ones least qualified feel most confident, while the most competent stay quiet and stuck. The world doesn’t reward the most prepared, it rewards the most visible. You think you’ll be recognized for your potential, but potential isn’t marketable. Output is. Dumb people aren’t waiting to be discovered; they’re already posting, pitching, and promoting. When you don’t know what can go wrong, you move without friction. Dumb people act out of blindness, not bravery. But that blindness becomes an edge. While you’re busy analyzing variables, they’re collecting data through action. They act first and fix later. Their first launch flops, so they learn. Their second launch improves, so they grow. You, on the other hand, are still in version 0.1 of your plan, trying to predict outcomes instead of testing them. The market rewards motion, not forecasts. Real experts know enough to be cautious, which makes them slow. Amateurs move fast because they’re too naive to see the depth of the problem. By the time the expert takes the first step, the fool already owns the attention, the audience, and half the market share.Perception Beats Precision — People buy conviction before they buy correctness. They follow confidence, not IQ. If someone speaks with certainty, the brain equates that certainty with competence. That’s why fake gurus thrive and quiet professionals fade into the background. In every domain (business, art, relationships) certainty is louder than skill. If you aren’t visible, you’re invisible, no matter how brilliant your work is. Dumb people are visible by accident; smart people remain invisible on purpose, and they call it humility. One of them gets paid. If you need to read that again, feel free. The smarter you are, the more likely you are to isolate. You tell yourself you’re “focusing,” but isolation kills feedback. Dumb people broadcast everything. They get data early. They learn in public. Every piece of feedback compounds their competence. Meanwhile, your silence compounds your doubt. Confidence isn’t something you earn after you succeed; it’s something you decide before you do. Stupid people don’t wait for proof: they move first. Confidence is not arrogance; it’s simply refusing to let uncertainty make your decisions. Action → Evidence → Belief → More Action. Every move produces evidence that you’re capable. That evidence rewires your identity. Belief grows, and with it, your willingness to take bigger risks. The loop reinforces itself until movement becomes your default. Each time you act while afraid, your nervous system learns that fear isn’t fatal. The discomfort fades faster than you expect. After enough reps, risk feels like home. That’s how confidence is built: through friction, not through affirmations. How did you learn to ride a bicycle? Dumb people don’t romanticize failure, they normalize it. They fail so often it stops meaning anything. That’s why they appear fearless. Their secret isn’t courage; it’s repetition. You can’t build thick skin by staying safe. Confidence doesn’t live in your head, it lives in the arena. Each visible action, every post, pitch, or project adds to your internal database of proof. The more you show up, the more solid your self-belief becomes. Private wins feel good, but public ones rewire your identity. Eventually, you stop chasing confidence and start embodying it. You no longer need to feel ready because you’ve proven that readiness is irrelevant. You act first, refine later. That’s the loop dumb people enter by accident, but you can enter on purpose once you finish this training. The Dunning-Kruger curve is a staircase more than it is an obstacle. Everyone climbs it: blind confidence, harsh reality, humble rebuilding, quiet mastery. The only difference is how long you stay stuck on each step. Dumb people don’t wait for permission to publish, pitch, or sell. They give themselves permission through action. Smart people wait for validation that never comes. Confidence is self-issued; if you’re waiting for approval, you’re outsourcing your potential. Your first version will suck. The second version will suck. That’s their job. It’s supposed to be clumsy. It’s supposed to be awkward and incomplete. You get to version 10 only by releasing versions 1 through 9. Perfection is just procrastination wearing expensive clothes. Being seen creates accountability. When you put your work in public, you stop negotiating with yourself. You start refining faster because now the world is watching. That pressure is priceless because it forces evolution. Motivation is unreliable. Systems aren’t. Build structures that force movement even when you don’t feel like it. Post every day. Make five offers a week. Review what worked every Friday. You don’t need more discipline, you just need fewer decisions. Action rewires the brain faster than belief. Each time you move, your brain logs a win and releases dopamine. And over time, you become chemically addicted to progress. Comfort starts to feel dangerous. Growth becomes the new baseline. Stupid people use the crowd as a mirror. They get feedback early, adapt publicly, and earn trust through transparency. Smart people hide until they’re perfect. But perfection can’t be trusted, it’s too polished to be real. Authentic imperfection always wins attention.Intelligence without motion becomes self-sabotage.The world rewards conviction before competence.Confidence is not found; it’s trained through exposure.Failure is a feedback system, not a verdict.Visibility compounds faster than skill.The people you call “dumb” or “stupid” are just willing to look stupid longer than you.The only qualification for success is movement. Pick one uncomfortable action you’ve delayed and do it today. Post it. Ship it. Send it. The goal isn’t perfection. It’s participation. Run a 30-day experiment: produce something every day and publish it. Ignore metrics. Focus on the reps. When fear shows up, remember: dumber people are already winning. Use that as proof that readiness is irrelevant. List the areas of your life or business where you’re invisible by choice. Visibility is leverage; stop hiding your value. Action → Feedback → Iteration → Identity. That’s the entire game.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>There&apos;s More Markets Pain Coming Soon: 3-Minute MLIV</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eXtlFA3wA</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q1eXtlFA3wA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 08:19:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson, Kriti Gupta and Mark Cudmore break down today's key themes for analysts and investors on "Bloomberg: The Opening Trade."

ABC News reports: The ozone hole reached its greatest one-day extent for 2025 in early September, measuring 8.83 million square miles, about 30% smaller than the largest hole on record in 2006. NOAA and NASA scientists emphasize that recent findings show efforts to limit ozone-depleting chemical compounds can have a significant impact. The regulations are established by the Montreal Protocol, which went into effect in 1992. Subsequent amendments are driving the gradual recovery of the ozone layer, which remains on track to fully recover later this century as countries worldwide replace harmful substances with safer alternatives.
 
For decades, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting compounds were widely used in aerosol sprays, foams, air conditioners and refrigerators, causing significant reductions in ozone levels. Natural factors, such as temperature and atmospheric circulation, also influence ozone concentrations and are likely to have contributed to a smaller ozone hole this year, according to researchers. "This year's hole would have been more than one million square miles larger if there was still as much chlorine in the stratosphere as there was 25 years ago," said Paul Newman, a senior scientist at the University of Maryland system and longtime leader of NASA's ozone research team.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Watch Live: Europe Today — Margrethe Vestager, EU digital czar, reacts to tense EU-US trade talks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTqlX_0bf0</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gHTqlX_0bf0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 06:58:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every morning at 8 am Brussels time, you can join Euronews’ chief anchor Méabh Mc Mahon and our EU editor Maria Tadeo, who will bring you up to speed on the major news events of the day in our new daily show “Europe Today”.

Blast is redefining how organizations eliminate cloud risks using preventive guardrails to ensure environments remain secure by design. The company is already working with numerous global enterprises to secure their production environments, preventing cloud risk by over 90% and significantly shrinking the blast radius.Enterprises operating at multi-cloud scale face relentless change and compounding complexity accelerated by the growth of AI. Blast’s Preemptive Cloud Defense Platform marks an inflection point for organizations shifting from reactive alert-chasing to proactive, continuously enforced prevention.It turns native cloud control into a preventive defense fabric, where every change is modelled, tested, and enforced safely. This approach ensures prevention never breaks production or slows innovation.“Cloud adoption and AI have multiplied complexity and risk faster than teams can keep up. The market is full of tools for detection and remediation, but the only reliable way to mitigate risk is to prevent it in the first place - and that’s what Blast is built to do,” said Boris Vaynberg, co-founder and CEO of Blast Security.“When Henry Ford introduced his automobile, many believed horses were good enough. It’s hard to see how a new approach can redefine the standard - until it becomes the standard. Our mission is to make prevention the new standard in cloud security and lead the market shift.”The lightbulb moment for Blast’s founding team - Boris Vaynberg, Ido Bukra, and Roi Panai - came when they were called to reserve duty to lead a national-level cloud security project. During this critical time, the team realized that security must match the cloud’s speed, scale, and complexity with prevention measures-built in. Blast’s founding team brings over a decade of collaborative experience - their first company, Solebit, was acquired by Mimecast in their largest acquisition. Blast’s engineers are cloud security veterans committed to developing game-changing, practical solutions that prevent risks before they arise and keep cloud environments inherently secure.“At Via, we see the shift from alert-chasing to prevention as a strategic program to strengthen our overall defense. Blast enables us to enforce preventive guardrails at scale - making our cloud environments more resilient with the same resources, less manual effort, and the trust to ensure zero disruption to the business,” said Oren Hogery, CISO, Via.“Blast’s founding team has a remarkable history of solving complex security challenges,” said Itay Rand, General Partner at 10D Capital. “Their preemptive approach to cloud security meets a growing critical need in the market, enabling organizations to prevent threats rather than merely reacting to them. We’re thrilled to back Blast as they set a new standard for truly proactive cloud defense.”To learn more about Blast’s Preemptive Cloud Defense Platform and its capabilities, users can visit .  marks the end of reactive cloud security, replacing after-the-fact response with continuous prevention. Instead of reacting to threats and chasing alerts, Blast creates a living, preemptive defense fabric that continuously evolves with the enterprise cloud environment - eliminating alert fatigue, reducing operational friction, and shrinking the blast radius. The Blast founding team has worked together for more than a decade and has a proven track record of building scalable prevention products, including at Solebit (acquired by Mimecast). Headquartered in Tel Aviv, Blast is backed by leading investors and trusted by global organizations.:::tip

I simply was barely using it, and whenever I did it was more out of habit than it really being the thing I wanted to do with my time. Sure, there's still some decent stuff on there, but the vast majority of it feels absolutely moneyballed. Good, but somehow , and with no character.As much as I'd love to elaborate on why I think Netflix is evil, that's not todays topic. What I wanted to share is how for approximately the price I was paying for my subscription (€19.99), I've snapped up three subscriptions that I'm using on a daily basis. They're all pretty much interchangeable with other alternatives. The main thing I want to highlight is the individual slot they each fill out for me.1. A subscription to Zed Pro (~€10)Frankly, I haven't really put too much thought into whether the unit economics are the best here. The main point is, these are €10 that make my coding experience more pleasant, and get me writing more code in my spare time. In that sense it's money well spent.Does it matter if you get a Cursor subscription, or a Zed one, or whatever else is in vogue when you're reading? No, just get the thing that will get you excited to get your hands on the keyboard!
To me, Zed feels more intentionally built than the VSClones: things flow nicely, it feels snappy, the ui is less cluttered... It's just .Editor preferences aside, the main takeaway is, invest in a hobby you actively engage in. Make that little bit more appealing and you have one more reason to be spending your time doing the thing that makes you feel good, rather than letting a couple hours a day evaporate watching another forgettable show.2. A Kagi subscription (~€5/month)I think we can mostly agree google kind of sucks nowadays. Whenever I search, I automatically scroll down to skip the sponsored posts and SEO maxxed websites, and still don't fully trust what I get. Maybe that's why we all started appending “reddit” the end of our searches.Are the search results themselves better with Kagi? To be honest, I can't tell yet, others have written far more informed takes on the topic. What does it for me is the simple fact of being able to pay directly for a service that I use, and value, rather than having to trade my attention in and endure a wall of ads. Especially if it's something I use over and over, every day. That's what I mean to highlight here: we can support products that we enjoy by paying for them (who would have thought?) rather than letting them lobotomize us via ad feeds.3. A cheap server on Hetzner (~€4/month)Again, the choice of provider here is secondary. The point is, I finally have my little stake on the internet. It's relatively barebones, and I like that. It forces me to learn and engage. In fact, that is where my blog is hosted!So to sum it up: We don't  to default to a streaming subscription because that's become the standard human-being thing to do. For the same money you can build a suite of useful, well crafted tools that help you:
– Get the most out of your hobbies
– Spend less time looking at ads
– Build things you can share with the worldP.S. Not one word here was written by AI. I plan on keeping it that way for anything that goes on this blog. So, if anything reads like slop, it's  slop :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Most Stable Raspberry Pi? Better NTP with Thermal Management</title><link>https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/11/24/worlds-most-stable-raspberry-pi-81-better-ntp-with-thermal-management/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 06:35:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[But there was a problem. Despite having a stable PPS reference, my NTP server’s frequency drift was exhibiting significant variation over time. After months (years) of monitoring the system with Grafana dashboards, I noticed something interesting: the frequency oscillations seemed to correlate with CPU temperature changes. The frequency would drift as the CPU heated up during the day and cooled down at night, even though the PPS reference remained rock-solid.Like clockwork (no pun intended), I somehow get sucked back into trying to improve my setup every 6-8 weeks. This post is the latest on that never-ending quest.This post details how I achieved an 81% reduction in frequency variability and 77% reduction in frequency standard deviation through a combination of CPU core pinning and thermal stabilization. Welcome to Austin’s Nerdy Things, where we solve problems that 99.999% of people (and 99% of datacenters) don’t have.The Problem: Thermal-Induced Timing JitterModern CPUs, including those in Raspberry Pis, use dynamic frequency scaling to save power and manage heat. When the CPU is idle, it runs at a lower frequency (and voltage). When load increases, it scales up. This is great for power efficiency, but terrible for precision timekeeping.Why? Because timekeeping (with NTP/chronyd/others) relies on a stable system clock to discipline itself against reference sources. If the CPU frequency is constantly changing, the system clock’s tick rate varies, introducing jitter into the timing measurements. Even though my PPS signal was providing a mostly perfect 1-pulse-per-second reference, the CPU’s frequency bouncing around made it harder for chronyd to maintain a stable lock.But here’s the key insight: the system clock is ultimately derived from a crystal oscillator, and crystal oscillator frequency is temperature-dependent. The oscillator sits on the board near the CPU, and as the CPU heats up and cools down throughout the day, so does the crystal. Even a few degrees of temperature change can shift the oscillator’s frequency by parts per million – exactly what I was seeing in my frequency drift graphs. The CPU frequency scaling was one factor, but the underlying problem was that temperature changes were affecting the crystal oscillator itself. By stabilizing the CPU temperature, I could stabilize the thermal environment for the crystal oscillator, keeping its frequency consistent.Looking at my Grafana dashboard, I could see the frequency offset wandering over a range of about 1 PPM (parts per million) as the Pi warmed up and cooled down throughout the day. The RMS offset was averaging around 86 nanoseconds, which isn’t terrible (it’s actually really, really, really good), but I knew it could be better.After staring at graphs for longer than I’d like to admit, I had an idea: what if I could keep the CPU at a constant temperature? If the temperature (and therefore the frequency) stayed stable, maybe the timing would stabilize too.The solution came in two parts:1.  – Dedicate CPU 0 exclusively to timing-critical tasks (chronyd and PPS interrupts) 2.  – Keep the other CPUs busy to maintain a constant temperature, preventing frequency scalingHere’s what happened when I turned on the thermal stabilization system on November 17, 2025 at 09:10 AM:Same ish graph but with CPU temp also plotted:That vertical red line marks on the first plot when I activated the “time burner” process. Notice how the frequency oscillations immediately dampen and settle into a much tighter band? Let’s dive into how this works.The Solution Part 1: CPU Core Pinning and Real-Time PriorityThe first step is isolating timing-critical operations onto a dedicated CPU core. On a Raspberry Pi (4-core ARM), this means:CPU 0: Reserved for chronyd and PPS interruptsCPUs 1-3: Everything else, including our thermal loadI had AI (probably Claude Sonnet 4 ish, maybe 4.5) create a boot optimization script that runs at system startup:#!/bin/bash
# PPS NTP Server Performance Optimization Script
# Sets CPU affinity, priorities, and performance governor at boot

set -e

echo "Setting up PPS NTP server performance optimizations..."

# Wait for system to be ready
sleep 5

    chronyd_pid=$(pgrep chronyd 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    if [ -n "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
        echo "Found chronyd PID: $chronyd_pid"
        break
    fi
    sleep 1
    ((timeout--))
done

if [ -z "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
    echo "Warning: chronyd not found after 30 seconds"

Temperature changes affect the CPU’s actual operating frequency due to thermal characteristics of the silicon.The solution? Keep the CPU at a constant temperature using a PID-controlled thermal load. I call it the “time burner” (inspired by CPU burn-in tools, but with precise temperature control).As a reminder of what we’re really doing here: we’re maintaining a stable thermal environment for the crystal oscillator. The RPi 3B’s 19.2 MHz oscillator is physically located near the CPU on the Raspberry Pi board, so by actively controlling CPU temperature, we’re indirectly controlling the oscillator’s temperature. Since the oscillator’s frequency is temperature-dependent (this is basic physics of quartz crystals), keeping it at a constant temperature means keeping its frequency stable – which is exactly what we need for precise timekeeping. from /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp calculates how much CPU time to burn to maintain target temperature (I chose 54°C)  run on CPUs 1, 2, and 3 (avoiding CPU 0)  alternates between busy-loop (MD5 hashing) and sleeping based on PID output  at the setpoint, preventing thermal driftHere’s the core implementation (simplified for readability):#!/usr/bin/env python3

    main()The full implementation includes a temperature filtering system to smooth out sensor noise and command-line arguments for tuning the PID parameters.: Proportional gain – responds to current error: Integral gain – eliminates steady-state error: Derivative gain – set to zero because temperature changes slowlyThe target temperature of 54°C was chosen empirically – high enough to keep the CPU from idling down, but low enough to avoid thermal throttling (which starts around 80°C on Raspberry Pi).The Results: Numbers Don’t LieThe improvement was immediately visible. Here are the statistics comparing performance before and after the optimization:A note on ambient conditions: The Raspberry Pi lives in a project enclosure in our master bedroom (chosen for its decent GPS reception and ADS-B coverage for a new aircraft AR overlay app idea I’m working on also running on this Pi). While the time burner maintains the CPU die temperature at 54°C, the enclosure is still subject to ambient temperature swings. Room temperature cycles from a low of 66°F (18.9°C) at 5:15 AM to a peak of 72°F (22.2°C) at 11:30 AM – a 6°F daily swing from our heating schedule. The fact that we see such dramatic frequency stability improvements  this ambient variation speaks to how effective the thermal control is. The CPU’s active heating overwhelms the environmental changes, maintaining consistent silicon temperature where it matters most.The RMS offset is chronyd’s estimate of the timing uncertainty. Cutting this nearly in half means the system is maintaining significantly better time accuracy.Want to replicate this? Here’s the step-by-step process:You need a working GPS PPS NTP server setup.

My Pi now draws about 3-4W continuously (vs 1-2W idle). Over a year, that’s an extra 15-25 kWh, or about $2-3 in electricity (depending on your rates).Running at 54°C means the Pi is warm to the touch. This is well within safe operating temperature (thermal throttling doesn’t start until 80°C), but you might want to ensure adequate ventilation. I added a small heatsink just to be safe.You’re dedicating 3 of 4 cores to burning cycles. This is fine for a dedicated NTP server, but not suitable if you’re running other services on the same Pi. That said, I am also running the feeder to my new ADS-B aircraft visualization app on it. My readsb instance regularly gets to 1200 msg/s with 200+ aircraft.For 99.999% of use cases: .Most applications don’t need better than millisecond accuracy, let alone the 35-nanosecond RMS offset I’m achieving. Even for distributed systems, microsecond-level accuracy is typically overkill.When this might make sense:Precision timing applications (scientific instrumentation, radio astronomy)Distributed systems research requiring tight clock synchronization where timing precision affects results (the best reason for any homelab project)For me, this falls squarely in the “because you can” category. I had the monitoring infrastructure in place, noticed the thermal correlation, and couldn’t resist solving the problem. Plus, I learned a lot about PID control, CPU thermal characteristics, and Linux real-time scheduling.Some ideas I’m considering:The current PID gains are hand-tuned for a specific ambient temperature range. The fairly low P value is to avoid spikes when some load on the Pi kicks up the temp. The I is a balance to keep long term “burn” relatively consistent. Implementing an auto-tuning algorithm (like Ziegler-Nichols) or adaptive PID could handle seasonal temperature variations better.Instead of software thermal control, I could add an actively cooled heatsink with PWM fan control. This might achieve similar temperature stability while using less power overall.Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO)For the ultimate in frequency stability, replacing the Pi’s crystal with a temperature-controlled OCXO would eliminate thermal drift at the source. This is how professional timing equipment works. I do have a BH3SAP GPSDO sitting next to me (subject to a future post)… Then again, I’m the person who just wrote 4000 words about optimizing a $50 time server, so who am I kidding?Through a combination of CPU core isolation and PID-controlled thermal stabilization, I achieved: in frequency variability in frequency standard deviation in frequency range in RMS offsetThe system now maintains 38-nanosecond median RMS offset from the GPS PPS reference, with frequency drift that’s barely detectable in the noise. The CPU runs at a constant 54°C, and in steady state, the frequency offset stays within a tight ±0.14 PPM band (compared to ±0.52 PPM before optimization).Was this necessary? No. Did I learn a bunch about thermal management, PID control, and Linux real-time scheduling? Yes. Would I do it again? Absolutely.I did come across a “burn” script that was the basis for this thermal management. I can’t find it at the moment, but when I do I’ll link it here.Have questions or suggestions? Drop a comment below. I’m particularly interested to hear if anyone has tried alternative thermal management approaches or has experience with OCXO modules for Raspberry Pi timing applications.Thanks for reading, and happy timekeeping!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Dilemma Over China’s Nvidia Access | Insight with Haslinda Amin 11/25/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SnfPSoaoH4</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3SnfPSoaoH4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 06:33:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Insight with Haslinda Amin, a daily news program featuring in-depth, high-profile interviews and analysis to give viewers the complete picture on the stories that matter.

Are we born with a pre-configured brain, or do thought patterns only begin to emerge in response to our sensory experiences of the world around us? Now, science is getting closer to answering the questions philosophers have pondered for centuries. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are using tiny models of human brain tissue, called organoids, to study the earliest moments of electrical activity in the brain. A new study in  finds that the earliest firings of the brain occur in structured patterns without any external experiences, suggesting that the human brain is preconfigured with instructions about how to navigate and interact with the world.“These cells are clearly interacting with each other and forming circuits that self-assemble before we can experience anything from the outside world,” said Tal Sharf, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and the study’s senior author. “There’s an operating system that exists, that emerges in a primordial state. In my laboratory, we grow brain organoids to peer into this primordial version of the brain’s operating system and study how the brain builds itself before it’s shaped by sensory experience.”In improving our fundamental understanding of human brain development, these findings can help researchers better understand neurodevelopmental disorders, and pinpoint the impact of toxins like pesticides and microplastics in the developing brain. Studying the developing brainThe brain, similar to a computer, runs on electrical signals—the firing of neurons. When these signals begin to fire, and how the human brain develops, are challenging topics for scientists to study, as the early developing human brain is protected within the womb.Organoids, which are 3D models of tissue grown from human stem cells in the lab, provide a unique window into brain development. The Braingeneers group at UC Santa Cruz, in collaboration with researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Santa Barbara, are pioneering methods to grow these models and take measurements from them to gain insights into brain development and disorders. Organoids are particularly useful for understanding if the brain develops in response to sensory input—as they exist in the lab setting and not the body—and can be grown ethically in large quantities. In this study, researchers prompted stem cells to form brain tissue, and then measured their electrical activity using specialized microchips, similar to those that run a computer. Sharf’s background in both applied physics, computation, and neurobiology form his expertise in modelling the circuitry of the early brain. “An organoid system that’s intrinsically decoupled from any sensory input or communication with organs gives you a window into what’s happening with this self-assembly process,” Sharf said. “That self-assembly process is really hard to do with traditional 2D cell culture—you can’t get the cell diversity and the architecture. The cells need to be in intimate contact with each other. We’re trying to control the initial conditions, so we can let biology do its wonderful thing.”The Sharf lab is developing novel neural interfaces, leveraging expertise in physics, materials science, and electrical engineering. On the right, Koushik Devarajan, an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the Sharf lab.The researchers observed the electrical activity of the brain tissue as they self-assembled from stem cells into a tissue that can translate the senses and produce language and conscious thought. They found that within the first few months of development, long before the human brain is capable of receiving and processing complex external sensory information such as vision and hearing, its cells spontaneously began to emit electrical signals characteristic of the patterns that underlie translation of the senses. Through decades of neuroscience research, the community has discovered that neurons fire in patterns that aren’t just random. Instead, the brain has a “default mode” — a basic underlying structure for firing neurons which then becomes more specific as the brain processes unique signals like a smell or taste. This background mode outlines the possible range of sensory responses the body and brain can produce.In their observations of single neuron spikes in the self-assembling organoid models, Sharf and colleagues found that these earliest observable patterns have striking similarity with the brain’s default mode. Even without having received any sensory input, they are firing off a complex repertoire of time-based patterns, or sequences, which have the potential to be refined for specific senses, hinting at a genetically encoded blueprint inherent to the neural architecture of the living brain.“These intrinsically self-organized systems could serve as a basis for constructing a representation of the world around us,” Sharf said. “The fact that we can see them in these early stages suggests that evolution has figured out a way that the central nervous system can construct a map that would allow us to navigate and interact with the world.”Knowing that these organoids produce the basic structure of the living brain opens up a range of possibilities for better understanding human neurodevelopment, disease, and the effects of toxins in the brain. “We’re showing that there is a basis for capturing complex dynamics that likely could be signatures of pathological onsets that we could study in human tissue,” Sharf said. “That would allow us to develop therapies, working with clinicians at the preclinical level to potentially develop compounds, drug therapies, and gene editing tools that could be cheaper, more efficient, higher throughput.”This study included researchers at UC Santa Barbara, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and ETH Zurich.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia strikes Ukrainian capital overnight amid renewed US efforts to end the fighting</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eOLSht5diM</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5eOLSht5diM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 06:14:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia strikes Ukrainian capital overnight amid renewed US efforts to end the fighting

That’s why I decided to build my own crypto card.I’ll walk you through what we created and how it can finally make spending crypto feel effortless.I love crypto, but for years, I was deeply frustrated by how hard it was to actually use it in the real world.I’m talking about the "crypto off-ramp pain" — that moment when you need your digital assets for something practical, like buying a plane ticket or paying a subscription, and you realize just how painful the process is. It’s slow, it’s expensive, and it’s packed with friction.For too long, the journey from your crypto wallet to your everyday life looked like this: four exhausting steps. You earn your crypto (say, USDT), then you navigate a P2P exchange or a complex trading platform, wait for a bank transfer that might take days, and only then can you finally spend your money.It’s a process riddled with risk, high fees, and the constant fear that your bank might block the transaction altogether.As someone who lives and breathes this industry, I’d had enough. I realized that if we — the builders — couldn't make spending crypto simple, then we were failing our users. It had to be fixed.The People Who Hurt the MostThis pain isn't just an inconvenience; for millions of people, it’s a major barrier to financial freedom. We saw three groups suffering the most:1. The Global Nomad and FreelancerYou earn in USDT, but you need to pay for Airbnbs, co-working spaces, and local services across different countries. The old way meant expensive SWIFT transfers and the constant struggle of opening local bank accounts. You need a global solution that moves at the speed of your life.2. The Active Trader and DeFi UserYou’ve just made a great trade, and now you need instant access to that liquidity — maybe for an emergency, or maybe to jump on a new investment opportunity. But the outdated, multi-step withdrawal process is a massive barrier to instant access.3. The High-Inflation Country ResidentFor many peoplek, stablecoins like USDT are a true "Digital Dollar" — a financial shield against currency devaluation and capital controls. But what good is a shield if you can’t use it when you need it most? They need a simple, reliable way to turn that stored value into real-world purchasing power without losing time and money.The demand for a better solution is massive. The crypto card market is projected to reach billions in the next few years, proving just how  this pain really is.The EMCD Way: One Step to FreedomMy team and I decided to stop complaining about off-ramp pain and build the solution ourselves. We took that frustrating four-step process and reduced it to just one: instant spending.It’s a virtual USD Mastercard directly connected to your EMCD Wallet. The magic lies in its simplicity:: You decide how much you want to spend. Tap once, and your USDT in the EMCD Wallet is instantly converted to USD on your card. No complex exchanges, no waiting, no hassle: You can use it online, or add it manually to your Apple Pay or Google Pay to pay offline, anywhere Mastercard is accepted: Your main crypto funds stay safe in your wallet. You only top-up what you need, giving you total control over your spending: We keep it simple and low: a flat $0.25 fee per operation. No hidden chargesWe built this card to be accessible to everyone, providing a vital financial bridge where traditional banking have failed.It’s Time to Stop Being Sick of the PainYour crypto should be as easy to spend as your bank balance. With the EMCD Payment Card, it finally is.==If you’re ready to ditch the off-ramp pain, here’s how simple it is to get started==:Complete a quick KYC (if you haven't already).Fund your Wallet with at least $15 in USDT.Open your Card in the "Crypto Card" section.Add it to Apple Pay or Google Pay and start spending globally.We built this because we believe in a world where financial freedom is instant and accessible. It’s time to stop suffering through off-ramp pain and start experiencing a better way — the EMCD way. \n ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CDC Data Indicates We’re 2 Months Away From America Losing Its Measles Elimination Status</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/24/cdc-data-indicates-were-2-months-away-from-america-losing-its-measles-elimination-status/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 03:35:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’ve talked a lot about measles throughout this year, which is particularly frustrating given that America officially eliminated this disease from its endemic state back in 2000. How we got here is a very simple story: too many people refused to vaccinate themselves and/or their children, giving the virus a foothold which it had been deprived for nearly a quarter of a century. And how  happened is also a frustratingly simple story: a combination of granola-munching liberals and the religious right in America got together in an unholy alliance to make up conspiracy theories about vaccines, claiming they cause autism and other complications.If there is a singular face for this idiotic movement, it is, of course, RFK Jr., who now heads up the Department of Health & Human Services. There should be no preamble necessary to explain just how bad RFK Jr. has been in his current role, nor how directly responsible he is for the anti-vaxxer movement going back long before this current administration had the audacity to place American healthcare in his hands. We’ve been talking about how this administration’s inaction has put America’s measles elimination status at risk going all the way back to April.We’re nearly there. To lose that status, a country must have endured continuous spread of a common strain of the disease over the course of 12 months. The CDC recently linked several outbreaks in America together via a singular strain, putting us at just over 10 months of continuous spread. The Times obtained a recording of a call during which officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to state health departments that the ongoing measles outbreak at the border of Arizona and Utah is a continuation of the explosive outbreak in West Texas that began in mid- to late-January. That is, the two massive outbreaks are being caused by the same subtype of measles virus.The massive outbreak in Texas began in mid- to late-January and was declared over on August 18. In all, there were 762 cases of measles confirmed in the outbreak. Utah and Arizona started seeing some measles cases in June, but those outbreaks appeared to take off in August. To date, Utah and Arizona have reported 212 cases.As ArsTechnica notes, America is not alone in this embarrassing failure, nor first. Canada just a few weeks ago lost its own elimination status for measles, having also endured 12 months of continuous spread of a singular strain. The cause for that is the same as in the States: non-participation in vaccination. And, frankly, the same people are responsible. Ignorance knows no borders, it turns out.Canada achieved elimination in 1998. The US did the same in 2000. Elimination was achieved through hard-fought vaccination campaigns, as two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97 percent protective against the virus, and that protection is considered lifelong. But, since that time, vaccine misinformation and potent rhetoric from anti-vaccine activists—including current US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have taken hold, driving vaccination rates down on a population level. While the vast majority of American and Canadian parents continue to vaccinate their children, certain pockets and close-knit communities have become dramatically undervaccinated, providing potential footholds for the virus.The CDC is, , touting its plan to combat measles. On its website, it talks about how it is ramping up its vaccination programs, trying to vaccinate more people, build out surveillance programs to monitor the disease’s spread, and respond quickly to outbreaks.I’ve reported on measles this year on a continual basis. I’m here to tell you one thing: if the CDC is doing literally any of the above, then it must be doing it in secret because I can’t square a single one of those claims with the reality we’re seeing across the country. RFK Jr. heads up HHS, under which CDC operates, and his messaging has been in  to what his child agency says it’s doing. He has questioned vaccines at every turn. He tore apart ACIP, the CDC advisory panel on immunization programs, and rebuilt it with anti-vaxxers that have already weakened our vaccination programs. And it shows in the numbers. Perhaps you thought that the two outbreaks had waned and the rate of spread was in decline. It absolutely is not.Sure, we’re at half the weekly new case rate compared with February and March. But those were the cold months, when viruses like this tend to spread more regularly due to more time being spent indoors without open windows for ventilation. Late winter and early spring are considered measles season and the fact that we’re already seeing a gradually rising spread rate, larger than before this past February and March, is extremely worrying. The worst part of all of this is to be reminded that, while America did eliminate endemic measles in 2000, that came after focused vaccination campaigns kicked off in 1991. Nearly a decade of work, completely down the drain. All because RFK Jr., a bunch of Hollywood celebrities, and pockets of the ultra-religious couldn’t be bothered to listen to actual scientists and doctors. In 1991, America endured 9,643 cases of measles. We’re on pace to achieve something like at least 2,000 cases in 2025. If it takes a couple of years to get back to elimination status at that number, it represents both needless suffering by the American people and a complete embarrassment to those in charge of America’s health.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hacker Conference Installed a Literal Antivirus Monitoring System</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/11/25/0024229/hacker-conference-installed-a-literal-antivirus-monitoring-system?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: Hacker conferences -- like all conventions -- are notorious for giving attendees a parting gift of mystery illness. To combat "con crud," New Zealand's premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees. To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO2 monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids' areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. "It's ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry," the organizers wrote on the convention's website. "What they did is fantastic," Jeff Moss, founder of the Defcon and Black Hat security conferences, told WIRED. "CO2 is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available. Kawaiicon building something to do this is the true spirit of hacking." [...]
 
Kawaiicon's work began one month before the conference. In early October, organizers deployed a small fleet of 13 RGB Matrix Portal Room CO2 Monitors, an ambient carbon dioxide monitor DIY project adapted from US electronics and kit company Adafruit Industries. The monitors were connected to an Internet-accessible dashboard with live readings, daily highs and lows, and data history that showed attendees in-room CO2 trends. Kawaiicon tested its CO2 monitors in collaboration with researchers from the University of Otago's public health department. The Michael Fowler Centre is a spectacular blend of Scandinavian brutalism and interior woodwork designed to enhance sound and air, including two grand pou -- carved Mori totems -- next to the main entrance that rise through to the upper foyers. Its cathedral-like acoustics posed a challenge to Kawaiicon's air-hacking crew, which they solved by placing the RGB monitors in stereo. There were two on each level of the Main Auditorium (four total), two in the Renouf session space on level 1, plus monitors in the daycare and Kuracon (kids' hacker conference) areas. To top it off, monitors were placed in the Quiet Room, at the Registration Desk, and in the Green Room.
 
Kawaiicon's attendees could quickly check the conditions before they arrived and decide how to protect themselves accordingly. At the event, WIRED observed attendees checking CO2 levels on their phones, masking and unmasking in different conference areas, and watching a display of all room readings on a dashboard at the registration desk. In each conference session room, small wall-mounted monitors displayed stoplight colors showing immediate conditions: green for safe, orange for risky, and red to show the room had high CO2 levels, the top level for risk. Colorful custom-made Kawaiicon posters by New Zealand artist Pepper Raccoon placed throughout the Michael Fowler Centre displayed a QR code, making the CO2 dashboard a tap away, no matter where they were at the conference.

They argue current arms treaties don't adequately cover these emerging tools and call for a new, proactive framework to prevent the weaponization of the human mind. The Guardian reports: Michael Crowley and Malcolm Dando, of Bradford University, are about to publish a book that they believe should be a wake-up call to the world. [...] The book, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, explores how advances in neuroscience, pharmacology and artificial intelligence are coming together to create a new threat. "We are entering an era where the brain itself could become a battlefield," said Crowley. "The tools to manipulate the central nervous system -- to sedate, confuse or even coerce -- are becoming more precise, more accessible and more attractive to states."
 
The book traces the fascinating, if appalling, history of state-sponsored research into central nervous system (CNS)-acting chemicals. [...] The academics argue that the ability exists to create much more "sophisticated and targeted" weapons that would once have been unimaginable. Dando said: "The same knowledge that helps us treat neurological disorders could be used to disrupt cognition, induce compliance, or even in the future turn people into unwitting agents." The threat is "real and growing" but there are gaps in international arms control treaties preventing it from being tackled effectively, they say. [...]
 
The book makes the case for a new "holistic arms control" framework, rather than relying on existing arms control treaties. It sets out a number of practical steps that could be taken, including establishing a working group on CNS-acting and broader incapacitating agents. Other proposals concern training, monitoring and definitions. "We need to move from reactive to proactive governance," said Dando. Both men acknowledge that we are learning more about the brain and the central nervous system, which is good for humanity. They said they were not trying to stifle scientific progress and it was about preventing malign intent. Crowley said: "This is a wake-up call. We must act now to protect the integrity of science and the sanctity of the human mind."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Prosus CEO on meeting with India&apos;s Modi on future of tech #trump #politics #economy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rmIQU7FwNuI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rmIQU7FwNuI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 02:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["We need to have global tech champions investing in local AI."

It centralizes DOE supercomputers, national lab resources, massive scientific datasets, and new AI foundation models into a single platform meant to fast track research in areas like fusion, biotech, microelectronics, and advanced manufacturing. The order positions AI as both a scientific accelerator and a national security requirement, with heavy emphasis on data access, secure cloud environments, classification controls, and export restrictions.
 
The mission also sets strict timelines for identifying key national science challenges, integrating interagency datasets, enabling AI run experimentation, and creating public private research partnerships. Whether this becomes an effective scientific engine or another oversized federal program remains to be seen, but the administration is clearly pushing to frame Trump as the president who put AI at the center of U.S. research strategy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Kernel Developers Eye Uses For Extra General Purpose Registers With APX</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-APX-Extra-GPRs-Kernel-Use</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 01:23:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With Advanced Performance Extensions (APX) on upcoming Intel processors doubling the number of general purpose registers (GPRs) among other advantages, Intel engineers are beginning to think of possible kernel uses for the extra registers...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US designates &apos;Cartel de los Soles&apos; as foreign terrorist organization | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0z_-nNZEHE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/U0z_-nNZEHE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 01:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Venezuela has rejected a decision by the US to officially designate the alleged drug cartel known as Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization – describing the move as a 'ridiculous lie.'

The Verge reports: In an interview with Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective's 2025 Demo Day, they said they are currently prototyping the device, and when asked about a timeframe, Ive said it could arrive in "less than" two years. Little has been revealed so far about the OpenAI device in development, but it's rumored to be screen-free and "roughly the size of a smartphone."
 
Altman described the design as "simple and beautiful and playful," adding that, "There was an earlier prototype that we were quite excited about, but I did not have any feeling of, "I want to pick up that thing and take a bite out of it,' and then finally we got there all of a sudden." Ive similarly emphasized simplicity and whimsy, saying, "I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity, and I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly, that you use them almost without thought, that they're just tools." Altman went on to comment, "I hope that when people see it, they say, 'That's it!,'" to which Ive responded, "Yeah, they will."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google teams up with Accel to hunt for India’s next AI breakouts</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/google-teams-up-with-accel-to-hunt-for-indias-next-ai-breakouts/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google and Accel will jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through their new partnership.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Japan&apos;s High-Stakes Gamble To Turn Island of Flowers Into Global Chip Hub</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/2248212/japans-high-stakes-gamble-to-turn-island-of-flowers-into-global-chip-hub?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from the BBC: The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse -- now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors. More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers. These days, cranes are popping up across the island -- building factories, research centers and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.
 
Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave. But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley -- or "Hokkaido Valley", as some have begun to call it -- the country could become a new contender in the $600 billion race to supply the world's computer chips. At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.
 
Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades. The government has invested $12 billion in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or "fab" in the small city of Chitose. In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty. Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonize with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC. Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia-Ukraine peace: What compromises are really acceptable for Ukraine? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9NPNQL5qQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ty9NPNQL5qQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:01:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The US and Ukraine say they've agreed to work on an 'updated and refined' version of a peace plan worked out by the US and Russia.

There we had a chance to speak with folks about interesting things happening in the Project and the wider community.In this interview, Xander Cesari sits down with Jan David Nose, then one of the full-time engineers on the Infrastructure Team, which maintains and develops the infrastructure upon which Rust is developed and deployed -- including CI/CD tooling and crates.io.We released this video on an accelerated timeline, some weeks ago, in light of the recent software supply chain attacks, but the interview was conducted prior to the news of compromised packages in other languages and ecosystems.: Hey, this is Xander Cesari with the Rust Project
Content Team, recording on the last hour of the last day of RustConf
2025 here in Seattle. So it's been a long and amazing two days. And I'm
sitting down here with a team member from the Rust Project Infra Team,
the unsung heroes of the Rust language. Want to introduce yourself and
kind of how you got involved?: Yeah, sure. I'm JD. Jan David is the full name, but
especially in international contexts, I just go with JD. I've been
working for the Rust Foundation for the past three years as a full-time
employee and I essentially hit the jackpot to work full-time on open
source and I've been in the Infra Team of the Rust Project for the
whole time. For the past two years I've led the team together with
Jake. So the Infra Team is kind of a thing that lets Rust happen and
there's a lot of different pieces.: Could you give me an overview of the responsibility
of the Infra Team?: Sure. I think on a high level, we think about this
in terms of, we serve two different groups of people. On one side, we
have users of the language, and on the other side, we really try to
provide good tooling for the maintainers of the language.: Starting with the maintainer side, this is really
everything about how Rust is built. From the moment someone makes a
contribution or opens a PR, we maintain the continuous integration that
makes sure that the PR actually works. There's a lot of bots and
tooling helping out behind the scenes to kind of maintain a good status
quo, a sane state. Lots of small things like triage tools on GitHub to
set labels and ping people and these kinds of things. And that's kind
of managed by the Infra Team at large.: And then on the user side, we have a lot of, or the
two most important things are making sure users can actually download
Rust. We don't develop crates.io, but we support the infrastructure to
actually ship crates to users. All the downloads go through content
delivery networks that we provide. The same for Rust releases. So if I
don't do my job well, which has happened, there might be a global
outage of crates.io and no one can download stuff. But those are kind
of the two different buckets of services that we run and operate.: Gotcha. So on the maintainer side, the Rust
organization on GitHub is a large organization with a lot of activity,
a lot of code. There's obviously a lot of large code bases being
developed on GitHub, but there are not that many languages the size of
Rust being developed on GitHub. Are there unique challenges to
developing a language and the tooling that's required versus developing
other software projects?: I can think of a few things that have less to do
with the language specifically, but with some of the architecture
decisions that were made very early on in the life cycle of Rust. So
one of the things that actually caused a lot of headache for mostly
GitHub, and then when they complained to us, for us as well, is that
for a long, long time, the index for crates.io was a Git repo on
GitHub. As Rust started to grow, the activity on the repo became so big
that it actually caused some issues, I would say, in a friendly way on
GitHub, just in terms of how much resources that single repository was
consuming. That then kind of started this work on a web-based,
HTTP-based index to shift that away. That's certainly one area where
we've seen how Rust has struggled a little bit with the platform, but
also the platform provider struggled with us.: I think for Rust itself, especially when we look at
CI, we really want to make sure that Rust works well on all of the
targets and all the platforms we support. That means we have an
extremely wide CI pipeline where, for every Tier 1 target, we want to
run all the tests, we want to build the release artifacts, we want to
upload all of that to S3. We want to do as much as we reasonably can
for Tier 2 targets and, to a lesser extent, maybe even test some stuff
on Tier 3. That has turned into a gigantic build pipeline. Marco gave a
talk today on what we've done with CI over the last year. One of the
numbers that came out of doing the research for this talk is that we
accumulate over three million build minutes per month, which is about
six years of CPU time every month.: Especially when it comes to open source projects, I
think we're one of the biggest consumers of GitHub Actions in that
sense. Not the biggest in total; there are definitely bigger commercial
projects. But that's a unique challenge for us to manage because we
want to provide as good a service as we can to the community and make
sure that what we ship is high quality. That comes at a huge cost in
terms of scaling. As Rust gets more popular and we want to target more
and more platforms, this is like a problem that just continues to
grow.: We'll probably never remove a lot of targets, so
there's an interesting challenge to think about. If it's already big
now, how does this look in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and how can we
make sure we can maintain the level of quality we want to ship? When
you build and run for a target in the CI pipeline, some of those Tier 1
targets you can just ask a cloud service provider to give you a VM
running on that piece of hardware, but some of them are probably not
things that you can just run in the cloud.: Is there some HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) lab
somewhere?: So you're touching on a conversation that's
happening pretty much as we speak. So far, as part of our target tier
policy, there is a clause that says it needs to be able to run in CI.
That has meant being very selective about only promoting things to Tier
1 that we can actually run and test. For all of this, we had a
prerequisite that it runs on GitHub Actions. So far we've used very
little hardware that is not natively supported or provided by GitHub.: But this is exactly the point with Rust increasing
in popularity. We just got requests to support IBM platforms and
RISC-V, and those are not natively supported on GitHub. That has kicked
off an internal conversation about how we even support this. How can we
as a project enable companies that can provide us hardware to test on?
What are the implications of that?: On one side, there are interesting constraints and
considerations. For example, you don't want your PRs to randomly fail
because someone else's hardware is not available. We're already so
resource-constrained on how many PRs we can merge each day that adding
noise to that process would really slow down contributions to Rust. On
the other side, there are security implications. Especially if we talk
about promoting something to Tier 1 and we want to build release
artifacts on that hardware, we need to make sure that those are
actually secure and no one sneaks a back door into the Rust compiler
target for RISC-V.: So there are interesting challenges for us,
especially in the world we live in where supply chain security is a
massive concern. We need to figure out how we can both support the
growth of Rust and the growth of the language, the community, and the
ecosystem at large while also making sure that the things we ship are
reliable, secure, and performant. That is becoming an increasingly
relevant and interesting piece to work on. So far we've gotten away
with the platforms that GitHub supports, but it's really cool to see
that this is starting to change and people approach us and are willing
to provide hardware, provide sponsorship, and help us test on their
platforms. But essentially we don't have a good answer for this yet.
We're still trying to figure out what this means, what we need to take
into consideration, and what our requirements are to use external
hardware.: Yeah, everyone is so excited about Rust will run
everywhere, but there's a maintenance cost there that is almost
exponential in scope.: It's really interesting as well because there's a
tension there. I think with IBM, for example, approaching us, it's an
interesting example. Who has IBM platforms at home? The number of users
for that platform is really small globally, but IBM also invests
heavily in Rust, tries to make this happen, and is willing to provide
the hardware.: For us, that leads to a set of questions. Is there
a line? Is there a certain requirement? Is there a certain amount of
usage that a platform would need for us to promote it? Or do we say we
want to promote as much as we can to Tier 1? This is a conversation we
haven't really had to have yet. It's only now starting to creep in as
Rust is adopted more widely and companies pour serious money and
resources into it. That's exciting to see.: In this specific case, companies approach the Infra
Team to figure out how we can add their platforms to CI as a first step
towards Tier 1 support. But it's also a broader discussion we need to
have with larger parts of the Rust Project. For Tier 1 promotions, for
example, the Compiler Team needs to sign off, Infra needs to sign off.
Many more people need to be involved in this discussion of how we can
support the growing needs of the ecosystem at large.: I get the feeling that's going to be a theme
throughout this interview.: So one other tool that's part of this pipeline that
I totally didn't know about for a long time, and I think a talk at a
different conference clued me into it, is Crater. It's a tool that
attempts to run all of the Rust code it can find on the internet. Can
you talk about what that tool does and how it integrates into the
release process?: Whenever someone creates a pull request on GitHub
to add a new feature or bug fix to the Rust compiler, they can start
what's called a Crater run, or an experiment. Crater is effectively a
large fleet of machines that tries to pull in as many crates as it can.
Ideally, we would love to test all crates, but for a variety of reasons
that's not possible. Some crates simply don't build reliably, so we
maintain lists to exclude those. From the top of my head, I think we
currently test against roughly 60% of crates.: The experiment takes the code from your pull
request, builds the Rust compiler with it, and then uses that compiler
to build all of these crates. It reports back whether there are any
regressions related to the change you proposed. That is a very
important tool for us to maintain backwards compatibility with new
versions and new features in Rust. It lets us ask: does the ecosystem
still compile if we add this feature to the compiler, and where do we
run into issues? Then, and this is more on the Compiler Team side,
there's a decision about how to proceed. Is the breakage acceptable? Do
we need to adjust the feature? Having Crater is what makes that
conversation possible because it gives us real data on the impact on
the wider ecosystem.: I think that's so interesting because as more and
more companies adopt Rust, they're asking whether the language is going
to be stable and backward compatible. You hear about other programming
languages that had a big version change that caused a lot of drama and
code changes. The fact that if you have code on crates.io, the Compiler
Team is probably already testing against it for backwards compatibility
is pretty reassuring.: Yeah, the chances are high, I would say. Especially
looking at the whole Python 2 to Python 3 migration, I think as an
industry we've learned a lot from those big version jumps. I can't
really speak for the Compiler Team because I'm not a member and I
wasn't involved in the decision-making, but I feel this is one of the
reasons why backwards compatibility is such a big deal in Rust's
design. We want to make it as painless as possible to stay current,
stay up to date, and make sure we don't accidentally break the language
or create painful migration points where the entire ecosystem has to
move at once.: Do you know if there are other organizations pulling
in something like Crater and running it on their own internal crate
repositories, maybe some of the big tech companies or other compiler
developers or even other languages? Or is this really bespoke for the
Rust compiler team?: I don't know of anyone who runs Crater itself as a
tool. Crater is built on a sandboxing framework that we also use in
other places. For example, docs.rs uses some of the same underlying
infrastructure to build all of the documentation. We try to share as
much as we can of the functionality that exists in Crater, but I'm not
aware of anyone using Crater in the same way we do.: Gotcha. The other big part of your job is that the
Infra Team works on supporting maintainers, but it also supports users
and consumers of Rust who are pulling from crates.io. It sounds like
crates.io is not directly within your team, but you support a lot of
the backend there.: Yeah, exactly. crates.io has its own team, and that
team maintains the web application and the APIs. The crates themselves,
all the individual files that people download, are hosted within our
infrastructure. The Infra Team maintains the content delivery network
that sits in front of that. Every download of a crate goes through
infrastructure that we maintain. We collaborate very closely with the
crates.io team on this shared interface. They own the app and the API,
and we make sure that the files get delivered to the end user.: So it sounds like there's a lot of verification of
the files that get uploaded and checks every time someone pushes a new
version to crates.io. That part all happens within crates.io as an
application.: Cargo uses the crates.io API to upload the crate
file. crates.io has a lot of internal logic to verify that it is valid
and that everything looks correct. For us, as the Infra Team, we treat
that as a black box. crates.io does its work, and if it is happy with
the upload, it stores the file in S3. From that point onward,
infrastructure makes sure that the file is accessible and can be
downloaded so people can start using your crate.: In this theme of Rust being a bit of a victim of its
own success, I assume all of the traffic graphs and download graphs are
very much up and to the right.: On the Foundation side, one of our colleagues likes
to check how long it takes for one billion downloads to happen on
crates.io, and that number has been falling quickly. I don't remember
what it was three years ago, but it has come down by orders of
magnitude. In our download traffic we definitely see exponential
growth. Our traffic tends to double year over year, and that trend has
been pretty stable. It really seems like Rust is getting a lot of
adoption in the ecosystem and people are using it for more and more
things.: How has the Infra Team scaled with that? Are you
staying ahead of it, or are there a lot of late nights?: There have definitely been late nights. In the
three years I've been working in the Infra Team, every year has had a
different theme that was essentially a fire to put out.: It changes because we fix one thing and then the
next thing breaks. So far, luckily, those fires have been mostly
sequential, not parallel. When I joined, bandwidth was the big topic.
Over the last year, it has been more about CI. About three years ago,
we hit this inflection point where traffic was doubling and the
sponsorship capacity we had at the time was reaching its limits.: Two or three years ago, Fastly welcomed us into
their Fast Forward program and has been sponsoring all of our bandwidth
since then. That has mostly helped me sleep at night. It has been a
very good relationship. They have been an amazing partner and have
helped us at every step to remove the fear that we might hit limits.
They are very active in the open source community at large; most
famously they also sponsor PyPI and the Python ecosystem, compared to
which we're a tiny fish in a very big pond. That gives us a lot of
confidence that we can sustain this growth and keep providing crates
and releases at the level of quality people expect.: In some ways, Rust did such a good job of making all
of that infrastructure feel invisible. You just type Cargo commands
into your terminal and it feels magical.: I'm really happy about that. It's an interesting
aspect of running an infrastructure team in open source. If you look at
the ten-year history since the first stable release, or even the
fifteen years since Rust really started, infrastructure was
volunteer-run for most of that time. I've been here for three years,
and I was the first full-time infrastructure engineer. So for ten to
twelve years, volunteers ran the infrastructure.: For them, it was crucial that things just worked,
because you can't page volunteers in the middle of the night because a
server caught fire or downloads stopped working. From the beginning,
our infrastructure has been designed to be as simple and as reliable as
possible. The same is true for our CDNs. I always feel a bit bad
because Fastly is an amazing sponsor. Every time we meet them at
conferences or they announce new features, they ask whether we want to
use them or talk about how we use Fastly in production. And every time
I have to say: we have the simplest configuration possible. We set some
HTTP headers. That's pretty much it.: It's a very cool platform, but we use the smallest
set of features because we need to maintain all of this with a
very small team that is mostly volunteer-based. Our priority has always
been to keep things simple and reliable and not chase every fancy new
technology, so that the project stays sustainable.: Volunteer-based organizations seem to have to care
about work-life balance, which is probably terrific, and there are
lessons to be learned there.: Yeah, it's definitely a very interesting
environment to work in. It has different rules than corporations or
commercial teams. We have to think about how much work we can do in a
given timeframe in a very different way, because it's unpredictable
when volunteers have time, when they're around, and what is happening
in their lives.: Over the last few years, we've tried to reduce the
number of fires that can break out. And when they do happen, we try to
shield volunteers from them and take that work on as full-time
employees. That started with me three years ago. Last year Marco
joined, which increased the capacity we have, because there is so much
to do on the Infra side that even with me working full-time, we simply
did not have enough people.: So you're two full-time and everything else is
volunteer.: Exactly. The team is around eight people. Marco and
I work full-time and are paid by the Rust Foundation to focus
exclusively on infrastructure. Then we have a handful of volunteers who
work on different things.: Because our field of responsibility is so wide, the
Infra Team works more in silos than other teams might. We have people
who care deeply about very specific parts of the infrastructure.
Otherwise there is simply too much to know for any one person. It has
been a really nice mix, and it's amazing to work with the people on the
team.: As someone who is privileged enough to work
full-time on this and has the time and resources, we try to bear the
bigger burden and create a space that is fun for volunteers to join. We
want them to work on exciting things where there is less risk of
something catching fire, where it's easier to come in, do a piece of
work, and then step away. If your personal life takes over for two
weeks, that's okay, because someone is there to make sure the servers
and the lights stay on.: A lot of that work lives more on the maintainer
side: the GitHub apps, the bots that help with triage. It's less risky
if something goes wrong there. On the user side, if you push the wrong
DNS setting, as someone might have done, you can end up in a situation
where for 30 minutes no one can download crates. And in this case,
"no one" literally means no user worldwide. That's not
an experience I want volunteers to have. It's extremely stressful and
was ultimately one of the reasons I joined in the first place—there was
a real feeling of burnout from carrying that responsibility.: It's easier to carry that as a full-timer. We have
more time and more ways to manage the stress. I'm honestly extremely
amazed by what the Infra Team was able to do as volunteers. It's
unbelievable what they built and how far they pushed Rust to get to
where we are now.: I think anyone who's managing web traffic in 2025 is
talking about traffic skyrocketing due to bots and scrapers for AI or
other purposes. Has that hit the Rust network as well?: Yeah, we've definitely seen that. It's handled by a
slightly different team, but on the docs.rs side in particular we've
seen crawlers hit us hard from time to time, and that has caused
noticeable service degradation. We're painfully aware of the increase
in traffic that comes in short but very intense bursts when crawlers go
wild.: That introduces a new challenge for our
infrastructure. We need to figure out how to react to that traffic and
protect our services from becoming unavailable to real users who want
to use docs.rs to look up something for their work. On the CDN side,
our providers can usually handle the traffic. It is more often the
application side where things hurt.: On the CDN side we also see people crawling
crates.io, presumably to vacuum up the entire crates ecosystem into an
LLM. Fortunately, over the last two years we've done a lot of work to
make sure crates.io as an application is less affected by these traffic
spikes. Downloads now bypass crates.io entirely and go straight to the
CDN, so the API is not hit by these bursts. In the past, this would
have looked like a DDoS attack, with so many requests from so many
sources that we couldn't handle it.: We've done a lot of backend work to keep our stack
reliable, but it's definitely something that has changed the game over
the last year. We can clearly see that crawlers are much more active
than before.: That makes sense. I'm sure Fastly is working on this
as well. Their business has to adapt to be robust to this new internet.: Exactly. For example, one of the conversations
we're having right now is about docs.rs. It's still hosted on AWS
behind CloudFront, but we're talking about putting it behind Fastly
because through Fastly we get features like bot protection that can
help keep crawlers out.: This is a good example of how our conversations
have changed in the last six months. At the start of the year I did not
think this would be a topic we would be discussing. We were focused on
other things. For docs.rs we have long-term plans to rebuild the
infrastructure that powers it, and I expected us to spend our energy
there. But with the changes in the industry and everyone trying to
accumulate as much data as possible, our priorities have shifted. The
problems we face and the order in which we tackle them have changed.: And I assume as one of the few paid members of a
mostly volunteer team, you often end up working on the fires, not the
interesting next feature that might be more fun.: That is true, although it sounds a bit negative to
say I only get to work on fires. Sometimes it feels like that because,
as with any technology stack, there is a lot of maintenance overhead.
We definitely pay that price on the infrastructure side.: Marco, for example, spent time this year going
through all the servers we run, cataloging them, and making sure
they're patched and on the latest operating system version. We updated
our Ubuntu machines to the latest LTS. It feels a bit like busy
work—you just have to do it because it's important and necessary, but
it's not the most exciting project.: On the other hand, when it comes to things like CDN
configuration and figuring out how bot protection features work and
whether they are relevant to us, that is also genuinely interesting
work. It lets us play with new tools vendors provide, and we're working
on challenges that the wider industry is facing. How do you deal with
this new kind of traffic? What are the implications of banning bots?
How high is the risk of blocking real users? Sometimes someone just
misconfigures a curl script, and from the outside it looks like they're
crawling our site.: So it's an interesting field to work in, figuring
out how we can use new features and address new challenges. That keeps
it exciting even for us full-timers who do more of the
"boring" work. We get to adapt alongside how the world
around us is changing. If there's one constant, it's change.: Another ripped-from-the-headlines change around this
topic is software supply chain security, and specifically xz-utils and
the conversation around open source security. How much has that changed
the landscape you work in?: The xz-utils compromise was scary. I don't want to
call it a wake-up call, because we've been aware that supply chain
security is a big issue and this was not the first compromise. But the
way it happened felt very unsettling. You saw an actor spend a year and
a half building social trust in an open source project and then using
that to introduce a backdoor.: Thinking about that in the context of Rust: every
team in the project talks about how we need more maintainers, how
there's too much workload on the people who are currently contributing,
and how Rust's growth puts strain on the organization as a whole. We
want to be an open and welcoming project, and right now we also need to
bring new people in. If someone shows up and says, "I'm
willing to help, please onboard me," and they stick around for
a year and then do something malicious, we would be susceptible to
that. I don't think this is unique to Rust. This is an inherent problem
in open source.: Yeah, it's antithetical to the culture.: Exactly. So we're trying to think through how we,
as a project and as an ecosystem, deal with persistent threat actors
who have the time and resources to play a long game. Paying someone to
work full-time on open source for a year is a very different threat
model than what we used to worry about.: I used to joke that the biggest threat to crates.io
was me accidentally pulling the plug on a CDN. I think that has
changed. Today the bigger threat is someone managing to insert
malicious code into our releases, our supply chain, or crates.io
itself. They could find ways to interfere with our systems in ways
we're simply not prepared for, where, as a largely volunteer
organization, we might be too slow to react to a new kind of attack.: Looking back over the last three years, this shift
became very noticeable, especially after the first year. Traffic was
doubling, Rust usage was going up a lot, and there were news stories
about Rust being used in the Windows kernel, in Android, and in parts
of iOS. Suddenly Rust is everywhere. If you want to attack
"everywhere," going after Rust becomes attractive.
That definitely puts a target on our back and has changed the game.: I'm very glad the Rust Foundation has a dedicated
security engineer who has done a lot of threat modeling and worked with
us on infrastructure security. There's also a lot of work happening
specifically around the crates ecosystem and preventing supply chain
attacks through crates. Luckily, it's not something the Infra side has
to solve alone. But it is getting a lot more attention, and I think it
will be one of the big challenges for the future: how a mostly
volunteer-run project keeps up with this looming threat.: And it is the industry at large. This is not a
unique problem to the Rust package manager. All package registries,
from Python to JavaScript to Nix, deal with this. Is there an
industry-wide conversation about how to help each other out and share
learnings?: Yeah, there's definitely a lot happening. I have to
smile a bit because, with a lot of empathy but also a bit of relief, we
sometimes share news when another package ecosystem gets compromised.
It is a reminder that it's not just us, sometimes it's npm this time.: We really try to stay aware of what's happening in
the industry and in other ecosystems: what new threats or attack
vectors are emerging, what others are struggling with. Sometimes that
is security; sometimes it's usability. A year and a half ago, for
example, npm had the "everything" package where
someone declared every package on npm as a dependency, which blew up
the index. We look at incidents like that and ask whether crates.io
would struggle with something similar and whether we need to make
changes.: On the security side we also follow closely what
others are doing. In the packaging community, the different package
managers are starting to come together more often to figure out which
problems everyone shares. There is a bit of a joke that we're all just
shipping files over the internet. Whether it's an npm package or a
crate, ultimately it's a bunch of text files in a zip. So from an
infrastructure perspective the problems are very similar.: These communities are now talking more about what
problems PyPI has, what problems crates.io has, what is happening in
the npm space. One thing every ecosystem has seen—even the very
established ones—is a big increase in bandwidth needs, largely
connected to the emergence of AI. PyPI, for example, publishes download
charts, and it's striking. Python had steady growth—slightly
exponential, but manageable—for many years. Then a year or two ago you
see a massive hockey stick. People discovered that PyPI was a great
distribution system for their models. There were no file size limits at
the time, so you could publish precompiled GPU models there.: That pattern shows up everywhere. It has kicked off
a new era for packaging ecosystems to come together and ask: in a time
where open source is underfunded and traffic needs keep growing, how
can we act together to find solutions to these shared problems?
crates.io is part of those conversations. It's interesting to see how
we, as an industry, share very similar problems across
ecosystems—Python, npm, Rust, and others.: With a smaller, more hobbyist-focused community, you
can have relaxed rules about what goes into your package manager.
Everyone knows the spirit of what you're trying to do and you can get
away without a lot of hard rules and consequences. Is the Rust world
going to have to think about much harder rules around package sizes,
allowed files, and how you're allowed to distribute things?: Funnily enough, we're coming at this from the
opposite direction. Compared to other ecosystems, we've always had
fairly strict limits. A crate can be at most around ten megabytes in
size. There are limits on what kinds of files you can put in there.
Ironically, those limits have helped us keep traffic manageable in this
period.: At the same time, there is a valid argument that
these limits may not serve all Rust use cases. There are situations
where you might want to include something precompiled in your crate
because it is hard to compile locally, takes a very long time, or
depends on obscure headers no one has. I don't think we've reached the
final state of what the crates.io package format should look like.: That has interesting security implications. When we
talk about precompiled binaries or payloads, we all have that little
voice in our head every time we see a curl | sh command: can I trust
this? The same is true if you download a crate that contains a
precompiled blob you cannot easily inspect.: The Rust Foundation is doing a lot of work and
research here. My colleague Adam, who works on the crates.io team, is
working behind the scenes to answer some of these questions. For
example: what kind of security testing can we do before we publish
crates to make sure they are secure and don't contain malicious
payloads? How do we surface this information? How do we tell a
publisher that they included files that are not allowed? And from the
user's perspective, when you visit crates.io, how can you judge how
well maintained and how secure a crate is?: Those conversations are happening quite broadly in
the ecosystem. On the Infra side we're far down the chain. Ultimately
we integrate with whatever security scanning infrastructure crates.io
builds. We don't have to do the security research ourselves, but we do
have to support it.: There's still a lot that needs to happen. As
awesome as Rust already is, and as much as I love using it, it's
important to remember that we're still a very young ecosystem. Python
is now very mature and stable, but it's more than 25 years old. Rust is
about ten years old as a stable language. We still have a lot to learn
and figure out.: Is the Rust ecosystem running into problems earlier
than other languages because we're succeeding at being foundational
software and Rust is used in places that are even more
security-critical than other languages, so you have to hit these hard
problems earlier than the Python world did?: I think that's true. Other ecosystems probably had
more time to mature and answer these questions. We're operating on a
more condensed timeline. There is also simply more happening now. Open
source has been very successful; it's everywhere. That means there are
more places where security is critical.: So this comes with the success of open source, with
what is happening in the ecosystem at large, and with the industry
we're in. It does mean we have less time to figure some things out. On
the flip side, we also have less baggage. We have less technical debt
and fifteen fewer years of accumulated history. That lets us be on the
forefront in some areas, like how a package ecosystem can stay secure
and what infrastructure a 21st century open source project needs.: Here I really want to call out the Rust Foundation.
They actively support this work: hiring people like Marco and me to
work full-time on infrastructure, having Walter and Adam focus heavily
on security, and as an organization taking supply chain considerations
very seriously. The Foundation also works with other ecosystems so we
can learn and grow together and build a better industry.: Behind the scenes, colleagues constantly work to
open doors for us as a relatively young language, so we can be part of
those conversations and sit at the table with other ecosystems. That
lets us learn from what others have already gone through and also help
shape where things are going. Sustainability is a big part of that: how
do we fund the project long term? How do we make sure we have the human
resources and financial resources to run the infrastructure and support
maintainers? I definitely underestimated how much of my job would be
relationship management and budget planning, making sure credits last
until new ones arrive.: Most open core business models give away the thing
that doesn't cost much—the software—and charge for the thing that
scales with use—the service. In Rust's case, it's all free, which is
excellent for adoption, but it must require a very creative perspective
on the business side.: Yeah, and that's where different forces pull in
opposite directions. As an open source project, we want everyone to be
able to use Rust for free. We want great user experience. When we talk
about downloads, there are ways for us to make them much cheaper, but
that might mean hosting everything in a single geographic location.
Then everyone, including people in Australia, would have to download
from, say, Europe, and their experience would get much worse.: Instead, we want to use services that are more
expensive but provide a better experience for Rust users. There's a
real tension there. On one side we want to do the best we can; on the
other side we need to be realistic that this costs money.: I had been thinking of infrastructure as a binary:
it either works or it doesn't. But you're right, it's a slider. You can
pick how much money you want to spend and what quality of service you
get. Are there new technologies coming, either for the Rust Infra Team
or the packaging world in general, to help with these security
problems? New sandboxing technologies or higher-level support?: A lot of people are working on this problem from
different angles. Internally we've talked a lot about it, especially in
the context of Crater. Crater pulls in all of those crates to build
them and get feedback from the Rust compiler. That means if someone
publishes malicious code, we will download it and build it.: In Rust this is a particular challenge because
build scripts can essentially do anything on your machine. For us that
means we need strong sandboxing. We've built our own sandboxing
framework so every crate build runs in an isolated container, which
prevents malicious code from escaping and messing with the host systems.: We feel that pain in Crater, but if we can solve it
in a way that isn't exclusive to Crater—if it also protects user
machines from the same vulnerabilities—that would be ideal. People like
Walter on the Foundation side are actively working on that. I'm sure
there are conversations in the Cargo and crates teams as well, because
every team that deals with packages sees a different angle of the
problem. We all have to come together to solve it, and there is a lot
of interesting work happening in that area.: I hope help is coming.: I'm optimistic.: We have this exponential curve with traffic and
everything else. It seems like at some point it has to taper off.: We'll see. Rust is a young language. I don't know
when that growth will slow down. I think there's a good argument that
it will continue for quite a while as adoption grows.: Being at a conference like RustConf, it's exciting
to see how the mix of companies has changed over time. We had a talk
from Rivian on how they use Rust in their cars. We've heard from other
car manufacturers exploring it. Rust is getting into more and more
applications that a few years ago would have been hard to imagine or
where the language simply wasn't mature enough yet.: As that continues, I think we'll see new waves of
growth that sustain the exponential curve we currently have, because
we're moving into domains that are new for us. It's amazing to see who
is talking about Rust and how they're using it, sometimes in areas like
space that you wouldn't expect.: I'm very optimistic about Rust's future. With this
increase in adoption, we'll see a lot of interesting lessons about how
to use Rust and a lot of creative ideas from people building with it.
With more corporate adoption, I also expect a new wave of investment
into the ecosystem: companies paying people to work full-time on
different parts of Rust, both in the ecosystem and in the core project.
I'm very curious what the next ten years will look like, because I
genuinely don't know.: The state of Rust right now does feel a bit like the
dog that caught the car and now doesn't know what to do with it.: Yeah, I think that's a good analogy. Suddenly we're
in a situation where we realize we haven't fully thought through every
consequence of success. It's fascinating to see how the challenges
change every year. We keep running into new growing pains where
something that wasn't an issue a year ago suddenly becomes one because
growth keeps going up.: We're constantly rebuilding parts of our
infrastructure to keep up with that growth, and I don't see that
stopping soon. As a user, that makes me very excited. With the language
and the ecosystem growing at this pace, there are going to be very
interesting things coming that I can't predict today.: For the project, it also means there are real
challenges: financing the infrastructure we need, finding maintainers
and contributors, and creating a healthy environment where people can
work without burning out. There is a lot of work to be done, but it's
an exciting place to be.: Well, thank you for all your work keeping those
magic Cargo commands I can type into my terminal just working in the
background. If there's any call to action from this interview, it's
that if you're a company using Rust, maybe think about donating to keep
the Infra Team working.: We always love new Rust Foundation members.
Especially if you're a company, that's one of the best ways to support
the work we do. Membership gives us a budget we can use either to fund
people who work full-time on the project or to fill gaps in our
infrastructure sponsorship where we don't get services for free and
have to pay real money.: And if you're not a company, we're always looking
for people to help out. The Infra Team has a lot of Rust-based bots and
other areas where people can contribute relatively easily.: Small scoped bots that you can wrap your head around
and help out with.: Exactly. It is a bit harder on the Infra side
because we can't give people access to our cloud infrastructure. There
are areas where it's simply not possible to contribute as a volunteer
because you can't have access to the production systems. But there is
still plenty of other work that can be done.: Like every other team in the project, we're a bit
short-staffed. So when you're at conferences, come talk to me or Marco.
We have work to do.: Well, thank you for doing the work that keeps Rust
running.: I'm happy to.: Awesome. Thank you so much.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kubernetes Configuration Good Practices</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/25/configuration-good-practices/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Configuration is one of those things in Kubernetes that seems small until it's not. Configuration is at the heart of every Kubernetes workload.
A missing quote, a wrong API version or a misplaced YAML indent can ruin your entire deploy.This blog brings together tried-and-tested configuration best practices. The small habits that make your Kubernetes setup clean, consistent and easier to manage.
Whether you are just starting out or already deploying apps daily, these are the little things that keep your cluster stable and your future self sane.This blog is inspired by the original Configuration Best Practices page, which has evolved through contributions from many members of the Kubernetes community.General configuration practicesUse the latest stable API versionKubernetes evolves fast. Older APIs eventually get deprecated and stop working. So, whenever you are defining resources, make sure you are using the latest stable API version.
You can always check withThis simple step saves you from future compatibility issues.Store configuration in version controlNever apply manifest files directly from your desktop. Always keep them in a version control system like Git, it's your safety net.
If something breaks, you can instantly roll back to a previous commit, compare changes or recreate your cluster setup without panic.Write configs in YAML not JSONWrite your configuration files using YAML rather than JSON. Both work technically, but YAML is just easier for humans. It's cleaner to read and less noisy and widely used in the community.YAML has some sneaky gotchas with boolean values:
Use only  or .
Don't write , ,  or .
They might work in one version of YAML but break in another. To be safe, quote anything that looks like a Boolean (for example ).Keep configuration simple and minimalAvoid setting default values that are already handled by Kubernetes. Minimal manifests are easier to debug, cleaner to review and less likely to break things later.If your Deployment, Service and ConfigMap all belong to one app, put them in a single manifest file.
It's easier to track changes and apply them as a unit.
See the Guestbook all-in-one.yaml file for an example of this syntax.You can even apply entire directories with:One command and boom everything in that folder gets deployed.Manifest files are not just for machines, they are for humans too. Use annotations to describe why something exists or what it does. A quick one-liner can save hours when debugging later and also allows better collaboration.The most helpful annotation to set is kubernetes.io/description. It's like using comment, except that it gets copied into the API so that everyone else can see it even after you deploy.Managing Workloads: Pods, Deployments, and JobsA common early mistake in Kubernetes is creating Pods directly. Pods work, but they don't reschedule themselves if something goes wrong. (Pods not managed by a controller, such as Deployment or a StatefulSet) are fine for testing, but in real setups, they are risky.Why?
Because if the node hosting that Pod dies, the Pod dies with it and Kubernetes won't bring it back automatically.Use Deployments for apps that should always be runningA Deployment, which both creates a ReplicaSet to ensure that the desired number of Pods is always available, and specifies a strategy to replace Pods (such as RollingUpdate), is almost always preferable to creating Pods directly.
You can roll out a new version, and if something breaks, roll back instantly.Use Jobs for tasks that should finishA Job is perfect when you need something to run once and then stop like database migration or batch processing task.
It will retry if the pods fails and report success when it's done.Service Configuration and NetworkingServices are how your workloads talk to each other inside (and sometimes outside) your cluster. Without them, your pods exist but can't reach anyone. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.Create Services before workloads that use themWhen Kubernetes starts a Pod, it automatically injects environment variables for existing Services.
So, if a Pod depends on a Service, create a Service its corresponding backend workloads (Deployments or StatefulSets), and before any workloads that need to access it.For example, if a Service named foo exists, all containers will get the following variables in their initial environment:FOO_SERVICE_HOST=<the host the Service runs on>
FOO_SERVICE_PORT=<the port the Service runs on>
DNS based discovery doesn't have this problem, but it's a good habit to follow anyway.Use DNS for Service discoveryIf your cluster has the DNS add-on (most do), every Service automatically gets a DNS entry. That means you can access it by name instead of IP:It's one of those features that makes Kubernetes networking feel magical.Avoid  and  unless absolutely necessaryYou'll sometimes see these options in manifests:But here's the thing:
They tie your Pods to specific nodes, making them harder to schedule and scale. Because each <, , > combination must be unique. If you don't specify the  and  explicitly, Kubernetes will use  as the default  and  as the default .
Unless you're debugging or building something like a network plugin, avoid them.Use headless Services for internal discoverySometimes, you don't want Kubernetes to load balance traffic. You want to talk directly to each Pod. That's where headless Services come in.You create one by setting .
Instead of a single IP, DNS gives you a list of all Pods IPs, perfect for apps that manage connections themselves.Working with labels effectivelyLabels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects such as Pods.
Labels help you organize, query and group your resources.
They don't do anything by themselves, but they make everything else from Services to Deployments work together smoothly.Good labels help you understand what's what, even after months later.
Define and use labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.
For example; : what the app is : which layer it belongs to (frontend/backend) : which stage it's in (test/prod)You can then use these labels to make powerful selectors.
For example:This will list all frontend Pods across your cluster, no matter which Deployment they came from.
Basically you are not manually listing Pod names; you are just describing what you want.
See the guestbook app for examples of this approach.Kubernetes actually recommends a set of common labels. It's a standardized way to name things across your different workloads or projects.
Following this convention makes your manifests cleaner, and it means that tools such as Headlamp, dashboard, or third-party monitoring systems can all
automatically understand what's running.Manipulate labels for debuggingSince controllers (like ReplicaSets or Deployments) use labels to manage Pods, you can remove a label to “detach” a Pod temporarily.The  part removes the label key .
Once that happens, the controller won’t manage that Pod anymore.
It’s like isolating it for inspection, a “quarantine mode” for debugging. To interactively remove or add labels, use .You can then check logs, exec into it and once done, delete it manually.
That’s a super underrated trick every Kubernetes engineer should know.These small tips make life much easier when you are working with multiple manifest files or clusters.Instead of applying one file at a time, apply the whole folder:This command looks for ,  and  files in that folder and applies them all together.
It's faster, cleaner and helps keep things grouped by app.Use label selectors to get or delete resourcesYou don't always need to type out resource names one by one.
Instead, use selectors to act on entire groups at once:It's especially useful in CI/CD pipelines, where you want to clean up test resources dynamically.Quickly create Deployments and ServicesFor quick experiments, you don't always need to write a manifest. You can spin up a Deployment right from the CLI:Then expose it as a Service:Cleaner configuration leads to calmer cluster administrators.
If you stick to a few simple habits: keep configuration simple and minimal, version-control everything,
use consistent labels, and avoid relying on naked Pods, you'll save yourself hours of debugging down the road.The best part?
Clean configurations stay readable. Even after months, you or anyone on your team can glance at them and know exactly what’s happening.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Stocks Rally on Tech Gains and Fed Rate Cut Hopes | The Close 11/24/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYrSrjsoEhI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DYrSrjsoEhI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:41:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg Television brings you the latest news and analysis leading up to the final minutes and seconds before and after the closing bell on Wall Street.

A Guide To The Terminology</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/24/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-a-guide-to-the-terminology/</link><author>Rindala Alajaji</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:26:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve been following the wave of age-gating laws sweeping across the country and the globe, you’ve probably noticed that lawmakers, tech companies, and advocates all seem to be using different terms for what sounds like the same thing. Age verification, age assurance, age estimation, age gating—they get thrown around interchangeably, but they technically mean different things. And those differences matter a lot when we’re talking about your rights, your privacy, your data, and who gets to access information online.So let’s clear up the confusion. Here’s your guide to the terminology that’s shaping these laws, and why you should care about the distinctions. refers to age-based restrictions on access to online services. Age gating can be required by law or voluntarily imposed as a corporate decision. Age gating does not necessarily refer to any specific technology or manner of enforcement for estimating or verifying a user’s age. It simply refers to the fact that a restriction exists. Think of it as the concept of “you must be this old to enter” without getting into the details of how they’re checking. Think of  as the catch-all category. It covers any method an online service uses to figure out how old you are with  of confidence. That’s intentionally vague, because age assurance includes everything from the most basic check-the-box systems to full-blown government ID scanning.Age assurance is the big tent that contains all the other terms we’re about to discuss below. When a company or lawmaker talks about “age assurance,” they’re not being specific about  they’re determining your age—just that they’re trying to. For decades, the internet operated on a “self-attestation” system where you checked a box saying you were 18, and that was it. These new age-verification laws are specifically designed to replace that system. When lawmakers say they want “robust age assurance,” what they really mean is “we don’t trust self-attestation anymore, so now you need to prove your age beyond just swearing to it.”Letting the Algorithm Decide is where things start getting creepy. Instead of asking you directly, the system  your age based on data it collects about you.Analyzing your face through a video selfie or photoLooking at your online behavior—what you watch, what you like, what you postChecking your existing profile dataCompanies like Instagram have partnered with services like Yoti to offer facial age estimation. You submit a video selfie, an algorithm analyzes your face, and spits out an estimated age range. Sounds convenient, right?Here’s the problem, “estimation” is exactly that: it’s a guess. And it is inherently imprecise. Age estimation is notoriously unreliable, especially for teenagers—the exact group these laws claim to protect. An algorithm might tell a website you’re somewhere between 15 and 19 years old. That’s not helpful when the cutoff is 18, and what’s at stake is a young person’s constitutional rights.And it gets worse. These systems consistently fail for certain groups:When estimation fails (and it often does), users get kicked to the next level: actual verification. Which brings us to… is the most invasive option. This is where you have to prove your age to a certain date, rather than, for example, prove that you have crossed some age threshold (like 18 or 21 or 65). EFF generally refers to most age gates and mandates on young people’s access to online information as “age verification,” as most of them typically require you to submit hard identifiers like:Government-issued ID (driver’s license, passport, state ID)Utility bills or other documentsThis is what a lot of new state laws are actually requiring, even when they use softer language like “age assurance.” Age verification doesn’t just confirm you’re over 18, it reveals your full identity. Your name, address, date of birth, photo—everything.Here’s the critical thing to understand: age verification is really identity verification. You’re not just proving you’re old enough—you’re proving exactly who you are. And that data has to be stored, transmitted, and protected by every website that collects it.We already know how that story ends. Data breachesareinevitable. And when a database containing your government ID tied to your adult content browsing history gets hacked—and it will—the consequences can be devastating.Why This Confusion MattersPoliticians and tech companies love using these terms interchangeably because it obscures what they’re actually proposing. A law that requires “age assurance” sounds reasonable and moderate. But if that law defines age assurance as requiring government ID verification, it’s not moderate at all—it’s mass surveillance. Similarly, when Instagram says it’s using “age estimation” to protect teens, that sounds privacy-friendly. But when their estimation fails and forces you to upload your driver’s license instead, the privacy promise evaporates.Here’s the uncomfortable truth: most lawmakers writing these bills have no idea how any of this technology actually works. They don’t know that age estimation systems routinely fail for people of color, trans individuals, and people with disabilities. They don’t know that verification systems have error rates. They don’t even seem to understand that the terms they’re using mean different things. The fact that their terminology is all over the place—using “age assurance,” “age verification,” and “age estimation” interchangeably—makes this ignorance painfully clear, and leaves the onus on platforms to choose whichever option best insulates them from liability.Language matters because it shapes how we think about these systems. “Assurance” sounds gentle. “Verification” sounds official. “Estimation” sounds technical and impersonal, and also admits its inherent imprecision. But they all involve collecting your data and create a metaphysical age gate to the internet. The terminology is deliberately confusing, but the stakes are clear: it’s your privacy, your data, and your ability to access the internet without constant identity checks. Don’t let fuzzy language disguise what these systems really do.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon Pledges Up To $50 Billion To Expand AI, Supercomputing For US Government</title><link>https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/2233254/amazon-pledges-up-to-50-billion-to-expand-ai-supercomputing-for-us-government?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon is committing up to $50 billion to massively expand AI and supercomputing capacity for U.S. government cloud regions, adding 1.3 gigawatts of high-performance compute and giving federal agencies access to its full suite of AI tools.

Nations reached a modest agreement in the Brazilian city of Belem on Saturday, accepting weaker language on phasing out fossil fuels, in order to preserve unity.

The final deal calls on countries to accelerate their climate action voluntarily, with only an implicit reference to moving away from oil, gas and coal. 

Speaking today in Geneva, UN rights chief Volker Türk said the outcome from Belem shows how 'corporate power imbalances play out in the climate emergency.'

Speaking to DW in Johannesburg, South Africa, at the G20 Summit, she emphasized that the global trading system was designed for interdependence, not overdependence. "The world trading system was built for interdependence, not overdependence and we see now overdependence on maybe the US for markets and on China for critical supplies" she said. Okonjo-Iweala also highlighted the potential benefits of Al in global trade, studies predict a nearly 40% boost by 2040.However, she warned that without equitable adoption, other regions risk being left behind China and the US. Her comments underscore the need for a more balanced and inclusive global trade landscape.

Arduino updated its ToS and privacy policy this month, which is about a month after Qualcomm announced that it's acquiring the open source hardware and software company. Among the most controversial changes is this addition: "User shall not: translate, decompile or reverse-engineer the Platform, or engage in any other activity designed to identify the algorithms and logic of the Platform's operation, unless expressly allowed by Arduino or by applicable license agreements ..."
 
In response to concerns from some members of the maker community, including from open source hardware distributor and manufacturer Adafruit, Arduino posted a blog on Friday. Regarding the new reverse-engineering rule, Arduino's blog said: "Any hardware, software or services (e.g. Arduino IDE, hardware schematics, tooling and libraries) released with Open Source licenses remain available as before. Restrictions on reverse-engineering apply specifically to our Software-as-a-Service cloud applications. Anything that was open, stays open."
 
But Adafruit founder and engineer Limor Fried and Adafruit managing editor Phillip Torrone are not convinced. They told Ars Technica that Arduino's blog leaves many questions unanswered and said that they've sent these questions to Arduino without response. "Why is reverse-engineering prohibited at all for a company built on openly hackable systems?" Fried and Torrone asked in a shared statement. There are also concerns about the ToS' broad new AI-monitoring powers, which offer little clarity on what data is collected, who can access it, or how long it's retained. On top of that, the update introduces an unusual patent clause that bars users from using the platform to identify potential infringement by Arduino or its partners, along with sweeping, perpetual rights over user-generated content. This could allow Arduino, and potentially Qualcomm, to republish, modify, monetize, or redistribute user uploads indefinitely.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stocks Push Higher on Rate-Cut Expectations | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1zrWUhQtb0</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-1zrWUhQtb0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 21:41:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Scarlet Fu, Scarlet Fu, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

Instead, what you’ll most consistently find is a sort of generic, ad-slathered, center-right, corporatist drivel with the rough edges (read: truth) sanded off like a Ken doll’s genitals to avoid offense. “View from nowhere” journalism that doesn’t inform so much as it tries to present a sanitized, corporate-friendly, apolitical platter of feckless infotainment mush.Usually this kind of pseudo-journalism directly reflects the interests of corporate ownership, something that’s been particularly true with Time Warner CEO David Zaslav. Zaslav has tried to “fix” CNN’s sagging viewership by routinely doing all the wrong things, because  (harder-nosed journalism, better quality content, hiring more actual reporters) don’t really align with his or the company’s broader interests. Because when people ask “how can we improve CNN?” “More ads,” was almost certainly the inevitable response.Later on in the story, Variety just copies and pastes the weird, baseless claims of a T-Mobile marketing official who pretends this is at all useful or good:This is the steady deterioration of U.S. media as it increasingly consolidates at the hands of corporations and billionaires who are utterly incapable of innovating in journalism. In part because they don’t want innovation in journalism (that would inevitably result in more criticism of how and why they got wealthy); they want a sort of journalistic infotainment simulacrum. On the plus side, the steady devolution of U.S. mainstream media into a mishmash of soggy advertorial invertebrates creates new opportunities for real journalism, reporters with a backbone, direct-to-audience newsletters, worker-owned media outlets, and alternative media sources actually interested in serving the public interest. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rad Power Bikes’ batteries receive major fire risk warning</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/rad-power-bikes-batteries-receive-major-fire-risk-warning/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 21:28:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission claims Rad Power "refused to agree to an acceptable recall."

Bitcoin began the week on the back foot following a prolonged selloff that has put the token on track for its worst month since 2022. 
After regaining some ground over the weekend, the original cryptocurrency fell as much as 3.1% to dip below $86,000 on Monday. It was trading at around $85,700 as of 9:53 a.m. in New York.
While that’s higher than the Friday lows of $80,553, traders see little cause for celebration. The wider crypto market is in a pronounced slump despite surging institutional adoption and a series of policy wins pushed for by US President Donald Trump, who has embraced the industry.

“Early trading today is showing slight weakness, but the moves are fairly small and within normal variations,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets. Bitcoin is likely to trade in $80,000 to $90,000 range throughout the week, as the market looks for clues about the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate decision, she added.
In crypto options market, traders are building downside protections at lower levels even Bitcoin prices have seen a slight rebound in the last 24 hours. Demand for put options at the strike of $80,000 has surpassed those at $85,000, becoming the most popular contracts, according to Coinbase-owned crypto exchange Deribit.
Meanwhile, the Bitcoin funding rate - a key measure of crypto market sentiment - has turned negative in the last few days, according to CryptoQuant, meaning there is more demand for bearish bets in the perpetual futures market than bullish positions. That figure had been persistently positive even amid the market rout in recent weeks. The flip points to signs of deepening slump in digital assets as more traders bet against the largest cryptocurrency.
Without a turnaround, November will become Bitcoin’s worst month since a string of corporate collapses rocked the crypto market in 2022, a wipeout that culminated in the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.

The average was around 22 months in 2016. 

[...] Research released by the Federal Reserve last month concludes that each additional year companies delay upgrading equipment results in a productivity decline of about one-third of a percent, with investment patterns accounting for approximately 55% of productivity gaps between advanced economies. 

The good news: businesses in the U.S. are generally quicker to reinvest in replacing aging equipment. The Federal Reserve report shows that if European productivity had matched U.S. investment patterns starting in 2000, the productivity gap between the U.S and European economic heavyweights would have been reduced by 29 percent for the U.K., 35 percent for France, and 101% for Germany.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>James Comey, Letitia James Charges Dismissed by Federal Judge</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awde5SAs4CY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Awde5SAs4CY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 21:14:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A federal judge threw out the charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the cases had been illegally appointed.

from the Oscar®-winning team behind “20 Days in Mariupol.”

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. Following his historic account of the civilian toll in Mariupol, Ukrainian filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov turns his lens towards Ukrainian soldiers — who they are, where they came from, and the impossible decisions they face in the trenches as they fight for every inch of their land.

The documentary follows a Ukrainian brigade battling through approximately one mile of a heavily fortified forest on their mission to liberate the Russian-occupied village of Andriivka amid a failing counteroffensive in 2023. 

Weaving together original footage, intensive Ukrainian Army bodycam video and powerful moments of reflection with haunting intimacy, the documentary reveals how the farther the soldiers advance through their destroyed homeland, the more they realize that, for them, this war may never end.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko, and is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New freediving record: 86 meters, no fins | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gLmAG8pfD-k</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gLmAG8pfD-k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 20:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukrainian freediver Kateryna Sadurska just shattered the women’s CNF (no‑fins, no‑rope) world record — diving 86 m on a single breath at the Blue Element Competition in Dominica.

Competition in digital markets matters, desperately. But antitrust enforcement is slow, cumbersome, and nearly blind to how fast these markets actually move. It takes years to litigate, offers limited effective remedies, and by the time courts rule, the competitive threats have often shifted entirely. The whole apparatus works fine for more slow-moving industries (which have real competition problems!) but consistently fails when applied to more dynamic markets where the landscape changes every few years.Over the last decade, figures like Lina Khan and Tim Wu have pushed a more aggressive vision of antitrust—variously called “hipster antitrust” or “neo-Brandeisian antitrust”—that promises to ignore these limitations and wield antitrust as a more punitive tool against large companies. The theory goes that punishing big companies will magically result in greater competition, a kind of antitrust trickle-down economics. The results of the Meta and Google cases suggest that if we want more competition in the digital space, there are much better policy levers than antitrust.As Judge Boasberg noted in his long and thorough opinion, the FTC’s bizarre attempt to define the market Meta was supposedly a monopolist in didn’t pass the laugh test. Notably, the FTC insisted that Meta’s market was just for “personal social networking” among friends and family, in an attempt to avoid the continued growing success of TikTok and YouTube as competitors. Thus, the FTC said the competition for Facebook and Instagram was just the much smaller Snapchat and the barely existing MeWe.As Boasberg noted, the FTC had to show that Meta continues to have a monopoly in the marketplace to win the case, and the only way the FTC could win that argument was if TikTok and YouTube were excluded from the market definition. But that is laughable:The FTC contends that Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat form a distinct market that can be identified by those apps’ unique features. While those apps certainly show some distinct markings, they mostly resemble two other social-media apps that the FTC insists must be excluded: TikTok and YouTube. Their dominant features are identical, people mostly use all four to watch unconnected content that they can send in direct messages, industry participants agree that the apps belong in the same competitive market, they use similar resources and technologies, and they charge the same price to the same customers.Even when considering only qualitative evidence, the Court finds that Meta’s apps are reasonably interchangeable with TikTok and YouTube…. Taking all the evidence together, it shows that personal social networking is not a separate product market. Instead, Meta competes in the market for social media, and that market includes — at minimum — TikTok and YouTube as well.The opinion repeatedly demonstrates that Meta was terrified of the growing success of TikTok (and, to a lesser extent, YouTube) and kept adjusting its products (hello “Reels”) to be more like those other apps.The court also demolished the FTC’s claim that Meta was harming consumers by making its products worse. Quite the opposite according to the actual evidence:So the FTC instead argues that Meta has degraded these apps’ quality. By offering a worse product for the same price, the agency reasons, Meta has imposed the equivalent of a price increase.The record, however, shows the opposite: Meta’s apps have continuously improved. The company has added scores of new features to Facebook and Instagram, from Stories to Reels to Marketplace…. The Court simply does not find it credible that users would prefer the Facebook and Instagram apps that existed ten years ago to the versions that exist todayThe court points to plenty of natural experiments (bans, downtime, etc.) that show that many users consider the Instagram/Facebook Reels effectively interchangeable with TikTok and YouTube Shorts.The broader problem here is that by the time the case reached trial, the competitive landscape had already shifted dramatically. Meta’s supposed monopoly was being actively challenged by TikTok’s explosive growth, forcing Meta to completely overhaul its products. The FTC’s case depended on freezing the market in time and pretending this competition didn’t exist.And, really, this all shows how terrible a tool antitrust is to deal with these markets.The Google case—which the DOJ technically won—suffered from a similar dynamic. Judge Amit Mehta recognized that the market had shifted quite a bit on its own, with Google’s search dominance being challenged by AI tools like ChatGPT. The remedies he imposed came up far short of what the government requested, precisely because the competitive threats were already emerging without court intervention.This is not to say that antitrust never makes sense or that we don’t need more competitive markets. But the fact that the FTC has been converted, under both administrations, to be more focused on punishing companies, rather than actually pursuing policies that increase competition is a problem.Tim Wu wrote an angry response to Boasberg’s decision in the NY Times, and in doing so, accidentally revealed the core problem with the neo-Brandeisian approach. When you strip away the legal arguments, it all comes down to vibes:Does anyone seriously doubt that Meta is the kind of company that antitrust laws were designed to restrain?That right there gives away the game. If your antitrust case is built on “doesn’t this company feel bad?” you’re going to take shortcuts, ignore inconvenient facts like the existence of TikTok, and then fail in court.Wu’s piece is instructive because it shows how the FTC arrived at its laughable market definition. He claims Boasberg dismissed the case “in the face of strong evidence to the contrary, not to mention common sense,” but the “common sense” he’s appealing to is just the intuition that Meta seems big and powerful. The actual evidence—the stuff Boasberg spent pages analyzing—showed robust competition forcing Meta to completely overhaul its products.Wu even complains that recognizing TikTok and YouTube as competitors represents “strained legal thinking” because they’re “adjacent markets.” But the whole point of antitrust law is to stop companies from abusing monopoly power to prevent competition. Showing that competition exists and is forcing the alleged monopolist to adapt its products is not a technicality—it’s proof that the market is working.There are ways to bring good antitrust cases, but they have to involve showing that there’s an actual monopoly under the law, that the monopoly is being abused by the monopolist in order to limit further competition and/or make products worse for consumers.When you start from “Meta feels like a monopoly” and work backward, you end up failing to make the case the law actually requires, and that doesn’t actually help enable a more competitive marketplace. The FTC was so focused on the vibes and how Meta  that it failed to make the actual case it needed to make.If we want actual competition in the marketplace, maybe stop focusing so much on antitrust laws and look at the issues that keep holding back actual competition: clean up broken copyright and patent laws that restrict competition, fix the CFAA which has been used repeatedly by big tech companies to stifle competition, and stop trying to pass laws that would make it impossible for smaller startups to exist because of the compliance costs.Those would actually enable much greater competition, but no one wants to do the hard work on those to ensure actual competition exists.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Belgium reaches budget deal as nationwide strikes continue despite agreement</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3N-xxT9BE</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dT3N-xxT9BE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 19:54:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Belgium reaches budget deal as nationwide strikes continue despite agreement

This gap between launch and utility has plagued nearly every major blockchain debut, but Monad's approach signals a different strategy.\
The Layer-1 blockchain, which went live on November 24, launched with complete DeFi functionality already operational. This was made possible through Enso's day-one integration, which eliminates the traditional development bottleneck that has limited previous blockchain ecosystems.The Integration Gap That Slows Every BlockchainBlockchain development follows a predictable pattern: launch the network, wait for developers to build applications, hope users eventually arrive. The problem is in the middle stage. According to research on blockchain developer activity, developers face technical barriers between different blockchain networks and protocols, requiring manual integration and maintenance work that can consume six months or more of development time.\
Ecosystems with more than 5,000 monthly active developers show more application launches CoinLaw, but reaching that threshold takes time. Base onboarded over 1,600 developers within its first year, which is considered strong performance. Most networks take considerably longer to establish a developer base capable of building functional applications.\
The result is a familiar chicken-and-egg scenario. Users avoid blockchains without applications. Developers avoid blockchains without users. Liquidity fragments across competing networks. The network effect that should accelerate growth instead becomes a barrier to entry.\
Monad's integration with Enso addresses this by providing developers access to pre-built protocol interactions from the start. Rather than spending months learning smart contract specifications and building custom integrations, developers can deploy applications that interact with swaps, bridges, lending markets, and other DeFi primitives immediately.What Blockchain Shortcuts Actually Mean for DevelopersEnso operates as a shared engine that standardizes blockchain interactions across protocols. The platform has mapped interactions across more than 160 protocols on multiple chains, creating reusable building blocks that developers can access through a single API.\
Think of it this way: building a DeFi application typically requires understanding how each protocol handles deposits, withdrawals, swaps, and other core functions. Aave handles lending differently than Compound. Uniswap routes trades differently than Curve. Each requires separate integration work, separate audits, and separate maintenance.\
Enso abstracts these differences by creating standardized shortcuts. A developer can call a "lend" function without needing to know whether it's executing on Aave, Compound, or another protocol. The Enso engine handles routing, optimization, and execution.\
For Monad builders, this means immediate access to functionality that would otherwise require extensive development time. Milos Costantini, Enso Co-Founder, said, "Supporting Monad from day one reflects exactly what Enso was built for: giving builders immediate access to the liquidity and tooling they need to ship valuable products. With Enso plugged into Monad at launch, teams can start creating sophisticated DeFi flows instantly, from swaps and lending to cross-chain markets."\
The technical implementation combines actions that abstract isolated smart contract transactions into simple components. These actions can be combined into shortcuts that create reusable workflows. Instead of manually integrating every protocol, developers define their intended outcome and let Enso's network coordinate the solution.Why Launch Liquidity Determines Network Success\
Yet technical capabilities alone don't guarantee adoption. Users need applications that let them actually use the blockchain. Enso's integration ensures Monad users can deploy assets immediately across trading, lending, and yield strategies rather than waiting for ecosystem development.\
Enso's role extends beyond launch support. The platform has enabled $17 billion in onchain settlements across its network, working with projects including Berachain, Uniswap, LayerZero, and Sushiswap. This track record provides Monad developers access to tested infrastructure rather than experimental tooling.The Development Time Problem That Enso SolvesTraditional blockchain development requires building everything from scratch. A team creating a liquidity aggregator needs to integrate with every decentralized exchange they want to access. Each integration requires understanding that exchange's specific smart contracts, building custom routing logic, conducting security audits, and maintaining the code as protocols update.\
Enso reduces this timeline dramatically. Developers using the platform can access DeFi functionality within days rather than months. The shortcuts handle protocol-specific details, security considerations, and optimization automatically. This allows teams to focus on user experience, product features, and go-to-market strategy rather than infrastructure.\
For Monad, this means the network can launch with a functional ecosystem rather than promising future development. Developers can build applications that work with lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, bridging solutions, and liquidity pools without individual integration work.\
The architecture uses a network of participants who contribute to the system. Action Providers publish smart contract abstractions. Graphers plot efficient paths for executing actions. Validators ensure solution accuracy and network security. This decentralized approach creates a self-improving system where the quality and breadth of available shortcuts expands over time.What This Means for the Monad EcosystemMonad allocated tokens to approximately 225,000 verified onchain users The Block through an airdrop designed to reward active participants in the DeFi ecosystem. Recipients included users of protocols ranging from Aave to Pump.fun, high-volume DEX traders, and holders of notable NFT collections.\
These users can immediately deploy their MON tokens across DeFi applications because Enso's integration provides the necessary infrastructure. Rather than waiting for developers to build out the ecosystem, users can access trading, lending, and liquidity provision from day one.\
This creates a different adoption curve than typical blockchain launches. Early users have functionality immediately available. Developers can build sophisticated applications quickly. Liquidity can flow into productive uses rather than sitting idle. The network effect that usually takes months to establish can begin on launch day.\
The integration also establishes a template for future blockchain launches. Rather than accepting weeks or months of limited functionality while developers build integrations, networks can partner with infrastructure providers like Enso to ensure comprehensive tooling from the start.Blockchain launches typically suffer from a timing problem: networks go live with impressive specifications but limited utility. Users find few applications. Developers see little reason to build without users. The ecosystem remains dormant until enough parties simultaneously decide to participate.\
Enso's Monad integration addresses this by ensuring functionality precedes the launch. Developers can build immediately. Users can deploy assets from day one rather than waiting for infrastructure to catch up. Whether this approach sets a new standard depends on execution. Monad must deliver on its technical promises, and applications built using Enso's shortcuts must provide sustained value beyond launch-day speculation.\
But the integration demonstrates that the traditional blockchain launch bottleneck has a solution. Networks that partner with infrastructure providers can compress months of waiting into immediate functionality, giving developers faster time to market and users immediate utility from new networks.\

DDR5 RAM, a necessity for building current-gen Intel or AMD systems, has now reached record highs in terms of pricing; a 64 GB kit of G.Skill's Trident Z5 Neo 6000 MT/s RAM is listed at $599.99 on Newegg right now — that's $200 more than a PS5 Slim or a Microsoft Xbox Series S, and just $50 shy off an entire PS5 Pro at the moment.That $600 price tag has a 6% discount already applied to its original $640 ask, as part of a Black Friday deal. For context, a more exclusive 64 GB limited edition Corsair Dominator Titanium kit cost only $349 when we reviewed it a few months ago. Earlier this year, we posted about DDR5 deals on Prime Day where the standard edition of the same kit was just $299, and you could get other comparable 64 GB kits for as low as $140.A quick glance at price tracking data, and G.Skill's Trident Z5 Neo kit has regularly sat at $205-$220 for the past few months, and it was only in late October that it started to pick up steam. From September 20th when it was listed at $220, to $640 now. In just 2 months we've witnessed an astounding ~190% surge.Right as this particular Trident Z5 Neo kit began to skyrocket in price was when the industry first started to pick up on the affects of the AI crunch. A few days later we published our initial coverage on DDR5 RAM price hikes; from there, the situation has only worsened to reach worrying levels.Insane mark-up aside, the kit itself is one of the best on the market, recommend as the top pick for DDR5 memory in our roundup. Unfortunately, it seems like high prices are going to be the story going forward. The surge in demand for AI projects will see production lines will prioritizing serving AI clients, leaving consumers to pay through the nose or make the best of what they have. Experts speculate that both DRAM and NAND constraints will become normal throughout 2026 as Big Tech looks to pursue AGI.Even Valve's upcoming Steam Machine will end up costing more than expected due to the production window of the device aligning with the DRAM crisis. That being said, memory has almost always lived in a rollercoaster cycle, with manufacturers oversupplying for a couple of years, then undersupplying for the next few. Looking at it optimistically, you're probably going to find DDR5 at bargain prices again .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unpowered SSDs slowly lose data</title><link>https://www.xda-developers.com/your-unpowered-ssd-is-slowly-losing-your-data/</link><author>amichail</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 19:25:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump claims ‘big progress’ on ending Russia Ukraine war</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/trump-claims-big-progress-on-ending-russia-ukraine-war</link><author>Paraic O&apos;Brien</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 19:23:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump has indicated that he believes ‘big progress’ is being made over moves to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.But Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that the ‘main problem’ with the original 28-point peace plan drawn up by the United States  concerns the territory it would hand to Russia.Meanwhile there’s been no let up in Russia’s  military action, with multiple people killed in attacks on a residential area in Kharkiv Sunday night.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Claude Advanced Tool Use</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use</link><author>lebovic</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 19:21:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The future of AI agents is one where models work seamlessly across hundreds or thousands of tools. An IDE assistant that integrates git operations, file manipulation, package managers, testing frameworks, and deployment pipelines. An operations coordinator that connects Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Jira, company databases, and dozens of MCP servers simultaneously.To build effective agents, they need to work with unlimited tool libraries without stuffing every definition into context upfront. Our blog article on using code execution with MCP discussed how tool results and definitions can sometimes consume 50,000+ tokens before an agent reads a request. Agents should discover and load tools on-demand, keeping only what's relevant for the current task.Agents also need the ability to call tools from code. When using natural language tool calling, each invocation requires a full inference pass, and intermediate results pile up in context whether they're useful or not. Code is a natural fit for orchestration logic, such as loops, conditionals, and data transformations. Agents need the flexibility to choose between code execution and inference based on the task at hand.Agents also need to learn correct tool usage from examples, not just schema definitions. JSON schemas define what's structurally valid, but can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.Today, we're releasing three features that make this possible:which allows Claude to use search tools to access thousands of tools without consuming its context windowProgrammatic Tool Calling, which allows Claude to invoke tools in a code execution environment reducing the impact on the model’s context window, which provides a universal standard for demonstrating how to effectively use a given toolIn internal testing, we’ve found these features have helped us build things that wouldn’t have been possible with conventional tool use patterns. For example,uses Programmatic Tool Calling to read and modify spreadsheets with thousands of rows without overloading the model’s context window.Based on our experience, we believe these features open up new possibilities for what you can build with Claude.MCP tool definitions provide important context, but as more servers connect, those tokens can add up. Consider a five-server setup:GitHub: 35 tools (~26K tokens)Slack: 11 tools (~21K tokens)Sentry: 5 tools (~3K tokens)Grafana: 5 tools (~3K tokens)Splunk: 2 tools (~2K tokens)That's 58 tools consuming approximately 55K tokens before the conversation even starts. Add more servers like Jira (which alone uses ~17K tokens) and you're quickly approaching 100K+ token overhead. At Anthropic, we've seen tool definitions consume 134K tokens before optimization.But token cost isn't the only issue. The most common failures are wrong tool selection and incorrect parameters, especially when tools have similar names like  vs. notification-send-channel.Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront, the Tool Search Tool discovers tools on-demand. Claude only sees the tools it actually needs for the current task.All tool definitions loaded upfront (~72K tokens for 50+ MCP tools)Conversation history and system prompt compete for remaining spaceTotal context consumption: ~77K tokens before any work beginsWith the Tool Search Tool:Only the Tool Search Tool loaded upfront (~500 tokens)Tools discovered on-demand as needed (3-5 relevant tools, ~3K tokens)Total context consumption: ~8.7K tokens, preserving 95% of context windowThis represents an 85% reduction in token usage while maintaining access to your full tool library. Internal testing showed significant accuracy improvements on MCP evaluations when working with large tool libraries. Opus 4 improved from 49% to 74%, and Opus 4.5 improved from 79.5% to 88.1% with Tool Search Tool enabled.How the Tool Search Tool worksThe Tool Search Tool lets Claude dynamically discover tools instead of loading all definitions upfront. You provide all your tool definitions to the API, but mark tools with  to make them discoverable on-demand. Deferred tools aren't loaded into Claude's context initially. Claude only sees the Tool Search Tool itself plus any tools with  (your most critical, frequently-used tools).When Claude needs specific capabilities, it searches for relevant tools. The Tool Search Tool returns references to matching tools, which get expanded into full definitions in Claude's context.For example, if Claude needs to interact with GitHub, it searches for "github," and only  and  get loaded—not your other 50+ tools from Slack, Jira, and Google Drive.This way, Claude has access to your full tool library while only paying the token cost for tools it actually needs.Tool Search Tool doesn't break prompt caching because deferred tools are excluded from the initial prompt entirely. They're only added to context after Claude searches for them, so your system prompt and core tool definitions remain cacheable.For MCP servers, you can defer loading entire servers while keeping specific high-use tools loaded:The Claude Developer Platform provides regex-based and BM25-based search tools out of the box, but you can also implement custom search tools using embeddings or other strategies.When to use the Tool Search ToolLike any architectural decision, enabling the Tool Search Tool involves trade-offs. The feature adds a search step before tool invocation, so it delivers the best ROI when the context savings and accuracy improvements outweigh additional latency.Tool definitions consuming >10K tokensExperiencing tool selection accuracy issuesBuilding MCP-powered systems with multiple serversSmall tool library (<10 tools)All tools used frequently in every sessionTool definitions are compactProgrammatic Tool CallingTraditional tool calling creates two fundamental problems as workflows become more complex:Context pollution from intermediate results: When Claude analyzes a 10MB log file for error patterns, the entire file enters its context window, even though Claude only needs a summary of error frequencies. When fetching customer data across multiple tables, every record accumulates in context regardless of relevance. These intermediate results consume massive token budgets and can push important information out of the context window entirely.Inference overhead and manual synthesis: Each tool call requires a full model inference pass. After receiving results, Claude must "eyeball" the data to extract relevant information, reason about how pieces fit together, and decide what to do next—all through natural language processing. A five tool workflow means five inference passes plus Claude parsing each result, comparing values, and synthesizing conclusions. This is both slow and error-prone.Programmatic Tool Calling enables Claude to orchestrate tools through code rather than through individual API round-trips. Instead of Claude requesting tools one at a time with each result being returned to its context, Claude writes code that calls multiple tools, processes their outputs, and controls what information actually enters its context window.Claude excels at writing code and by letting it express orchestration logic in Python rather than through natural language tool invocations, you get more reliable, precise control flow. Loops, conditionals, data transformations, and error handling are all explicit in code rather than implicit in Claude's reasoning.Example: Budget compliance checkConsider a common business task: "Which team members exceeded their Q3 travel budget?"You have three tools available:get_team_members(department) - Returns team member list with IDs and levelsget_expenses(user_id, quarter) - Returns expense line items for a userget_budget_by_level(level) - Returns budget limits for an employee levelFetch team members → 20 peopleFor each person, fetch their Q3 expenses → 20 tool calls, each returning 50-100 line items (flights, hotels, meals, receipts)Fetch budget limits by employee levelAll of this enters Claude's context: 2,000+ expense line items (50 KB+)Claude manually sums each person's expenses, looks up their budget, compares expenses against budget limitsMore round-trips to the model, significant context consumptionWith Programmatic Tool Calling:Instead of each tool result returning to Claude, Claude writes a Python script that orchestrates the entire workflow. The script runs in the Code Execution tool (a sandboxed environment), pausing when it needs results from your tools. When you return tool results via the API, they're processed by the script rather than consumed by the model. The script continues executing, and Claude only sees the final output.Here's what Claude's orchestration code looks like for the budget compliance task:Claude's context receives only the final result: the two to three people who exceeded their budget. The 2,000+ line items, the intermediate sums, and the budget lookups do not affect Claude’s context, reducing consumption from 200KB of raw expense data to just 1KB of results.The efficiency gains are substantial:: By keeping intermediate results out of Claude's context, PTC dramatically reduces token consumption. Average usage dropped from 43,588 to 27,297 tokens, a 37% reduction on complex research tasks.: Each API round-trip requires model inference (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds). When Claude orchestrates 20+ tool calls in a single code block, you eliminate 19+ inference passes. The API handles tool execution without returning to the model each time.: By writing explicit orchestration logic, Claude makes fewer errors than when juggling multiple tool results in natural language. Internal knowledge retrieval improved from 25.6% to 28.5%; GIA benchmarks from 46.5% to 51.2%.Production workflows involve messy data, conditional logic, and operations that need to scale. Programmatic Tool Calling lets Claude handle that complexity programmatically while keeping its focus on actionable results rather than raw data processing.How Programmatic Tool Calling works1. Mark tools as callable from codeAdd code_execution to tools, and set allowed_callers to opt-in tools for programmatic execution:The API converts these tool definitions into Python functions that Claude can call.2. Claude writes orchestration codeInstead of requesting tools one at a time, Claude generates Python code:3. Tools execute without hitting Claude's contextWhen the code calls get_expenses(), you receive a tool request with a caller field:You provide the result, which is processed in the Code Execution environment rather than Claude's context. This request-response cycle repeats for each tool call in the code.4. Only final output enters contextWhen the code finishes running, only the results of the code are returned to Claude:This is all Claude sees, not the 2000+ expense line items processed along the way.When to use Programmatic Tool CallingProgrammatic Tool Calling adds a code execution step to your workflow. This extra overhead pays off when the token savings, latency improvements, and accuracy gains are substantial.Processing large datasets where you only need aggregates or summariesRunning multi-step workflows with three or more dependent tool callsFiltering, sorting, or transforming tool results before Claude sees themHandling tasks where intermediate data shouldn't influence Claude's reasoningRunning parallel operations across many items (checking 50 endpoints, for example)Making simple single-tool invocationsWorking on tasks where Claude should see and reason about all intermediate resultsRunning quick lookups with small responsesJSON Schema excels at defining structure–types, required fields, allowed enums–but it can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.Consider a support ticket API:The schema defines what's valid, but leaves critical questions unanswered:Should  use "2024-11-06", "Nov 6, 2024", or "2024-11-06T00:00:00Z"?Is  a UUID, "USR-12345", or just "12345"?When should Claude populate ?How do  and  relate to priority?These ambiguities can lead to malformed tool calls and inconsistent parameter usage.Tool Use Examples let you provide sample tool calls directly in your tool definitions. Instead of relying on schema alone, you show Claude concrete usage patterns:From these three examples, Claude learns:: Dates use YYYY-MM-DD, user IDs follow USR-XXXXX, labels use kebab-caseNested structure patterns: How to construct the reporter object with its nested contact objectOptional parameter correlations: Critical bugs have full contact info + escalation with tight SLAs; feature requests have reporter but no contact/escalation; internal tasks have title onlyIn our own internal testing, tool use examples improved accuracy from 72% to 90% on complex parameter handling.When to use Tool Use ExamplesTool Use Examples add tokens to your tool definitions, so they’re most valuable when accuracy improvements outweigh the additional cost.Complex nested structures where valid JSON doesn't imply correct usageTools with many optional parameters and inclusion patterns matterAPIs with domain-specific conventions not captured in schemasSimilar tools where examples clarify which one to use (e.g.,  vs )Simple single-parameter tools with obvious usageStandard formats like URLs or emails that Claude already understandsValidation concerns better handled by JSON Schema constraintsBuilding agents that take real-world actions means handling scale, complexity, and precision simultaneously. These three features work together to solve different bottlenecks in tool use workflows. Here's how to combine them effectively.Layer features strategicallyNot every agent needs to use all three features for a given task. Start with your biggest bottleneck:Context bloat from tool definitions → Tool Search ToolLarge intermediate results polluting context → Programmatic Tool CallingParameter errors and malformed calls → Tool Use ExamplesThis focused approach lets you address the specific constraint limiting your agent's performance, rather than adding complexity upfront.Then layer additional features as needed. They're complementary: Tool Search Tool ensures the right tools are found, Programmatic Tool Calling ensures efficient execution, and Tool Use Examples ensure correct invocation.Set up Tool Search Tool for better discoveryTool search matches against names and descriptions, so clear, descriptive definitions improve discovery accuracy.Add system prompt guidance so Claude knows what's available:Keep your three to five most-used tools always loaded, defer the rest. This balances immediate access for common operations with on-demand discovery for everything else.Set up Programmatic Tool Calling for correct executionSince Claude writes code to parse tool outputs, document return formats clearly. This helps Claude write correct parsing logic:See below for opt-in tools that benefit from programmatic orchestration:Tools that can run in parallel (independent operations)Operations safe to retry (idempotent)Set up Tool Use Examples for parameter accuracyCraft examples for behavioral clarity:Use realistic data (real city names, plausible prices, not "string" or "value")Show variety with minimal, partial, and full specification patternsKeep it concise: 1-5 examples per toolFocus on ambiguity (only add examples where correct usage isn't obvious from schema)These features are available in beta. To enable them, add the beta header and include the tools you need:For detailed API documentation and SDK examples, see our:These features move tool use from simple function calling toward intelligent orchestration. As agents tackle more complex workflows spanning dozens of tools and large datasets, dynamic discovery, efficient execution, and reliable invocation become foundational.We're excited to see what you build.Written by Bin Wu, with contributions from Adam Jones, Artur Renault, Henry Tay, Jake Noble, Nathan McCandlish, Noah Picard, Sam Jiang, and the Claude Developer Platform team.

It’s intelligent, efficient, and the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use. It’s also meaningfully better at everyday tasks like deep research and working with slides and spreadsheets. Opus 4.5 is a step forward in what AI systems can do, and a preview of larger changes to how work gets done.Claude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the-art on tests of real-world software engineering:Opus 4.5 is available today on our apps, our API, and on all three major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, simply use  via the Claude API. Pricing is now $5/$25 per million tokens—making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.Alongside Opus, we’re releasing updates to the Claude Developer Platform, Claude Code, and our consumer apps. There are new tools for longer-running agents and new ways to use Claude in Excel, Chrome, and on desktop. In the Claude apps, lengthy conversations no longer hit a wall. See our product-focused section below for details.As our Anthropic colleagues tested the model before release, we heard remarkably consistent feedback. Testers noted that Claude Opus 4.5 handles ambiguity and reasons about tradeoffs without hand-holding. They told us that, when pointed at a complex, multi-system bug, Opus 4.5 figures out the fix. They said that tasks that were near-impossible for Sonnet 4.5 just a few weeks ago are now within reach. Overall, our testers told us that Opus 4.5 just “gets it.”Many of our customers with early access have had similar experiences. Here are some examples of what they told us:Evaluating Claude Opus 4.5We give prospective performance engineering candidates a notoriously difficult take-home exam. We also test new models on this exam as an internal benchmark. Within our prescribed 2-hour time limit, Claude Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate ever.The take-home test is designed to assess technical ability and judgment under time pressure. It doesn’t test for other crucial skills candidates may possess, like collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years. But this result—where an AI model outperforms strong candidates on important technical skills—raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession. Our Societal Impacts and Economic Futures research is aimed at understanding these kinds of changes across many fields. We plan to share more results soon.Software engineering isn’t the only area on which Claude Opus 4.5 has improved. Capabilities are higher across the board—Opus 4.5 has better vision, reasoning, and mathematics skills than its predecessors, and it is state-of-the-art in many domains:The model’s capabilities outpace some of the benchmarks we use in our tests. A common benchmark for agentic capabilities is τ2-bench, which measures the performance of agents in real-world, multi-turn tasks. In one scenario, models have to act as an airline service agent helping a distressed customer. The benchmark expects models to refuse a modification to a basic economy booking since the airline doesn’t allow changes to that class of tickets. Instead, Opus 4.5 found an insightful (and legitimate) way to solve the problem: upgrade the cabin first,  modify the flights.The benchmark technically scored this as a failure because Claude’s way of helping the customer was unanticipated. But this kind of creative problem solving is exactly what we’ve heard about from our testers and customers—it’s what makes Claude Opus 4.5 feel like a meaningful step forward.In other contexts, finding clever paths around intended constraints could count as —where models “game” rules or objectives in unintended ways. Preventing such misalignment is one of the objectives of our safety testing, discussed in the next section.As we state in our system card, Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model we have released to date and, we suspect, the best-aligned frontier model by any developer. It continues our trend towards safer and more secure models:Our customers often use Claude for critical tasks. They want to be assured that, in the face of malicious attacks by hackers and cybercriminals, Claude has the training and the “street smarts” to avoid trouble. With Opus 4.5, we’ve made substantial progress in robustness against prompt injection attacks, which smuggle in deceptive instructions to fool the model into harmful behavior. Opus 4.5 is harder to trick with prompt injection than any other frontier model in the industry:You can find a detailed description of all our capability and safety evaluations in the Claude Opus 4.5 system card.New on the Claude Developer PlatformAs models get smarter, they can solve problems in fewer steps: less backtracking, less redundant exploration, less verbose reasoning. Claude Opus 4.5 uses dramatically fewer tokens than its predecessors to reach similar or better outcomes.But different tasks call for different tradeoffs. Sometimes developers want a model to keep thinking about a problem; sometimes they want something more nimble. With our new effort parameter on the Claude API, you can decide to minimize time and spend or maximize capability.Set to a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5’s best score on SWE-bench Verified, but uses 76% fewer output tokens. At its highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points—while using 48% fewer tokens.With effort control, context compaction, and advanced tool use, Claude Opus 4.5 runs longer, does more, and requires less intervention.Our context management and memory capabilities can dramatically boost performance on agentic tasks. Opus 4.5 is also very effective at managing a team of subagents, enabling the construction of complex, well-coordinated multi-agent systems. In our testing, the combination of all these techniques boosted Opus 4.5’s performance on a deep research evaluation by almost 15 percentage points.We’re making our Developer Platform more composable over time. We want to give you the building blocks to construct exactly what you need, with full control over efficiency, tool use, and context management.Products like Claude Code show what’s possible when the kinds of upgrades we’ve made to the Claude Developer Platform come together. Claude Code gains two upgrades with Opus 4.5. Plan Mode now builds more precise plans and executes more thoroughly—Claude asks clarifying questions upfront, then builds a user-editable plan.md file before executing.Claude Code is also now available in our desktop app, letting you run multiple local and remote sessions in parallel: perhaps one agent fixes bugs, another researches GitHub, and a third updates docs.For Claude app users, long conversations no longer hit a wall—Claude automatically summarizes earlier context as needed, so you can keep the chat going. Claude for Chrome, which lets Claude handle tasks across your browser tabs, is now available to all Max users. We announced Claude for Excel in October, and as of today we've expanded beta access to all Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Each of these updates takes advantage of Claude Opus 4.5’s market-leading performance in using computers, spreadsheets, and handling long-running tasks.For Claude and Claude Code users with access to Opus 4.5, we’ve removed Opus-specific caps. For Max and Team Premium users, we’ve increased overall usage limits, meaning you’ll have roughly the same number of Opus tokens as you previously had with Sonnet. We’re updating usage limits to make sure you’re able to use Opus 4.5 for daily work. These limits are specific to Opus 4.5. As future models surpass it, we expect to update limits as needed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pebble Watch software is now open source</title><link>https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-watch-software-is-now-100percent-open-source</link><author>Larrikin</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:52:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Another big Pebble update today! TLDR:Yesterday, Pebble watch software was ~95% open source. Today, it’s 100% open source. You can download, compile and run all the software you need to use your Pebble. We just published the source code for the new Pebble mobile app!Pebble Appstore now has a publicly available backup and supports multiple feeds, providing long term reliability through decentralization. We’ve launched our own feed and Developer Dashboard.Pebble Time 2 schedule update (aiming to begin shipping in January, with most arriving on wrists in March/April)Pre-production Pebble Time 2 (Black/Red colourway) in all its gloryOver the last year, and especially in the last week, I've chatted with tons of people in the Pebble community. One of the main questions people have is ‘how do I know that my new Pebble watch will continue to work long into the future?’. It’s an extremely valid question and concern - one that I share as a fellow Pebble wearer. I called this out specifically in my blog post announcing the relaunch in January 2025. How is this time round going to be different from last time?There are two pieces to making Pebble sustainable long term - hardware and software.Nothing lasts forever, especially an inexpensive gadget like a Pebble. We want to be able to keep manufacturing these watches long into the future - mostly because I will always want one on my wrist! The company I set up to relaunch Pebble, Core Devices, is self funded, built without investors, and extremely lean. As long as we stay profitable (ie we don’t lose money), we will continue to manufacture new watches. We’re also making sure that our new watches are more repairable than old Pebble watches. The back cover of Pebble Time 2 is screwed in. You can remove the back cover and replace the battery.  We’ve also published electrical and mechanical design files for Pebble 2 Duo. Yes, you can download the schematic (includes KiCad project files) right now on Github! This should give you a nice jumpstart to designing your own PebbleOS-compatible device.Last time round, barely any of the Pebble software was open source. This made it very hard for the Pebble community to make improvements to their watches after the company behind Pebble shut down. Things are different now! This whole relaunch came about primarily because Google open sourced PebbleOS (thank you!). Yesterday, the software that powers Pebble watches was around 95% open source. As of today, it’s now 100%. This means that if Core Devices were to disappear into a black hole, you have all the source code you need to build, run and improve the software behind your Pebble.I confess that I misunderstood why 95% was much less sustainable than 100% until recently. I discuss this in more detail in my latest Tick Talk episode (check it out). Long story short - I’m an Android user and was happy to sideload the old Pebble APK on my phone, but iPhone and other Android users have basically been stuck without an easily available Pebble mobile companion app for years.    Here’s how we’re making sure the 3 main Pebble software components are open source and guaranteed to work long into the future: - software that runs on your watch itself. This has been 100% open source since January and we’ve committed to open sourcing all the improvements we’ve made → github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS. You can download the source code, compile PebbleOS and easily install it over Bluetooth on your new Pebble. Textbook definition of open source! Pebble mobile companion app -  the app that for your iPhone or Android. Without the app, your Pebble is basically a paperweight. When the Pebble Tech Corp died, the lack of an open source mobile app made it difficult for anyone to continue to use their watches. We had to build an entirely new app (get it here). Today, our app is now 100% open source on Github- ensuring that what happened before  happen again. Want to learn more about how we built the new app cross platform using Kotlin Multiplatform? Watch Steve’s presentation at Droidcon.Developer tools and Pebble Appstore - this software enables people to build and share their watchapps and watchfaces. Then there’s the Pebble Appstore. This is a collection of nearly 15,000 watchfaces and watchapps that you - the Pebble community - developed between 2012 and July 2018. When Fitbit pulled the plug on the original Pebble Appstore, the Rebble Foundation downloaded a copy of all the apps and faces, and set up a new web service to let users of the old Pebble app continue to download and use watchfaces. This was an incredible effort, one that I have used thousands of times and am a happy paying subscriber. But it’s still centralized - if their server disappears, there is no freely available backup. To compensate for that, today we’re launching two new things:The Pebble mobile app will soon (later this week) be able to subscribe to multiple appstore ‘feeds’. This is similar to open source package managers like pip, AUR, APT, etc. Anyone can create a Pebble-compatible appstore feed and users will be able to browse apps from that feed in the Pebble mobile app.We’ve created our own Pebble Appstore feed (appstore-api.repebble.com) and new Developer Dashboard. Our feed (fyi powered by 100% new software) is configured to back up an archive of all apps and faces to Archive.org (backup will gradually complete over the next week). Today, our feed only has a subset of all Pebble watchfaces and apps (thank you aveao for creating Pebble Archive!). Developers - you can upload your existing or new apps right now! We hope that this sets a standard for openness and we encourage all feeds to publish a freely and publicly available archive.Important to note - developers will still be able to charge money for their apps and faces, using Kiezel pay or other services. This change does not preclude them from doing that, in fact it makes it even easier - I could see some developers creating a paid-only feed. As I recently wrote, we're also working on other ways for Pebble developers to earn money by publishing fun, beautiful and creative Pebble apps.Another important note - some binary blobs and other non-free software components are used today in PebbleOS and the Pebble mobile app (ex: the heart rate sensor on PT2 , Memfault library, and others). Optional non-free web services, like Wispr-flow API speech recognizer, are also used. These non-free software components are not required - you can compile and run Pebble watch software without them. This will always be the case. More non-free software components may appear in our software in the future. The core Pebble watch software stack (everything you need to use your Pebble watch) will always be open source. Pre-production Pebble Time 2. These watches are not final quality! We are still tweaking and tuning everything.We’re currently in the middle of Pebble Time 2 design verification test (DVT) phase. After we finish that, we go into production verification test (PVT) and then mass production (MP). So far, things are proceeding according to the schedule update I shared last month but that is extraordinarily subject to change. We still have a lot of testing (especially waterproof and environmental) to go. If we find problems (which is likely) we will push the schedule back to make improvements to the product. The one major complicating factor is the timing of Chinese New Year (CNY). It’s early next year - factories will shut down for 3 weeks starting around the end of January. After restarting, things always take a week or two to get back to full speed. We are trying our best to get into mass production and ship out at most several thousand Pebble Time 2s before CNY. It’s going to be very tight 🤞. More likely is that production will begin after CNY, then we need to transfer the watches to our fulfillment center, and ship them out. Realistically, at this time we’re forecasting that the majority of people will receive their PT2 in March and April. Please keep in mind that things may still change.There will be 4 colour options for PT2 - black/black, black/red, silver/blue, silver/(white most likely). Let me be crystal very clear - no one has picked a colour yet 😃. In a few weeks, I will send out an email asking everyone who pre-ordered a Pebble Time 2 to select which colour they would like to receive. Please do not email us asking when this email will be sent out. No one has been invited yet to do this. I will post here after all emails have gone out.On a related note, I am extremely happy that we built and shipped Pebble 2 Duo. Not only is it an awesome watch, it was also a phenomenal way for us to exercise our production muscles and ease back into the systematic flow of building and shipping smartwatches. A video is worth a million words - so I encourage you to watch me demo Pebble Time 2 watches I just received this week. Keep in mind these watches are PRE-PRODUCTION which means they parts have imperfect qualities! Subject to change! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Black Moth, by Georgette Heyer</title><link>https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/georgette-heyer/the-black-moth</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/georgette-heyer/the-black-moth/downloads/georgette-heyer_the-black-moth.epub?source=feed" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:50:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard E-Books</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An earl turned highwayman repeatedly foils a rake in his attempted pursuit of a young woman.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Japan&apos;s Gargantuan Flood Defences</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzWRKUfsQqM</link><author>Megaprojects</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nzWRKUfsQqM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0woBco6Dgcxt0h8SwyyOmw">Megaprojects</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://surfshark.com/Mega or use code Mega at checkout to get 4 extra months of Surfshark VPN!

Beyond smartphones, it officially powers tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and XR headsets. However, it has virtually no presence on traditional PCs, where Google instead relies on ChromeOS. Despite Google’s efforts to challenge the dominance of Windows and macOS, ChromeOS remains a distant third. To close this gap, the company is unifying ChromeOS and Android into a single desktop platform, codenamed ‘Aluminium OS.’ Here’s what we know so far.Android on PCs: The story so farOne year ago,  exclusively revealed Google’s plan to rally behind Android as its unified desktop OS. Our source indicated that this shift aims to create products that better compete with the iPad while making more effective use of development resources. In July, a Google executive confirmed part of our reporting, revealing that the company intends to merge ChromeOS and Android into a single platform. Finally, at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in September, Google officially announced it is bringing Android to the PC market. The company stated it is collaborating with Qualcomm to build a new platform that converges mobile and desktop computing, leveraging recent advancements in AI.What feature would you most want from Aluminium OS?Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon (left) and Google SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh (right) announcing a joint project to bring Android to PCs.While we now know Google is building Android for PCs, there are still many unknown details. Is Google retiring the ChromeOS brand? Will existing Chromebooks receive the new operating system, or will they be left behind? Will this OS arrive only on budget machines, or target premium PCs as well? What will the interface actually look like, and what new features can we expect?These are the burning questions as Google continues developing the platform. We likely won’t have all the answers until we get closer to launch, but thanks to job listings and bug reports, we’ve uncovered early details that offer some clues.Aluminium OS: Google’s PC ambitions take shapeOver the weekend, a tipster on Telegram named Frost Core shared a link to an intriguing Google job listing for a ‘Senior Product Manager, Android, Laptop and Tablets.’ While we already know Google is bringing Android to the PC, the listing explicitly states that the role involves ‘working on a new Aluminium, Android-based, operating system.’ This effectively confirms that Aluminium is the codename for the new unified platform. The name appears to be a nod to the project’s roots: like Chromium (the open-source version of ChromeOS), Aluminium is a metal ending in ‘-ium.’ The choice of the British spelling — emphasizing the ‘Al’ prefix — likely pays homage to Android serving as the project’s foundation.”Much like Android XR, Google says its new Aluminium OS is ‘built with artificial intelligence (AI) at the core.’ This implies deep integration with Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot and large language model (LLM). At the Snapdragon Summit, Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of Devices and Services, outlined the company’s plans to bring its AI stack to PCs:“This is another way we can leverage all of the great work we’re doing together on our AI stack, our full stack, bringing Gemini models, bringing the assistant, bringing all of our applications and developer community into the PC domain. And I think this is another way in which Android is gonna be able to serve everyone in every computing category.”We have yet to see exactly what new features Gemini will enable on Android PCs, but we hope the OS will fully leverage the hardware’s potential. On select premium smartphones, Gemini already powers an array of on-device AI features that demand significant memory and processing power from the CPU, GPU, and NPU. There were concerns that Google might restrict this new OS to the same budget-friendly niche where Chromebooks currently excel, ceding the high-end market to Microsoft and Apple. However, the job listing dispels those fears.The new Senior Product Manager role is tasked with “driving the roadmap and curating a portfolio of ChromeOS and Aluminium Operating System (ALOS) Commercial devices across all form factors (e.g. laptops, detachables, tablets, and boxes) and tiers (e.g., Chromebook, Chromebook Plus, AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium) that meets the needs of users and the business.”This confirms that Android won’t be limited to laptops; the roadmap explicitly includes detachables, tablets, and ‘boxes’ (likely mini-PCs akin to the Chromebox or Mac Mini). Furthermore, the tiered structure — listing ‘AL Mass Premium’ and ‘AL Premium’ alongside ‘AL Entry’ — indicates that Google intends to push Android beyond budget PC hardware. While exact pricing for these tiers is hard to predict, it is clear Google aims to compete across the entire spectrum — a strategy foreshadowed by the recent Chromebook Plus initiative.Speaking of Chromebooks, the job listing also raises questions about the future of ChromeOS. The listing notes that the person will help “drive ChromeOS and Aluminium (e.g., Android) platforms and devices,” creating a roadmap and product portfolio that encompasses both. This implies the two platforms will coexist for some time. However, the person is also explicitly tasked with developing a strategy for transitioning “Google from ChromeOS to Aluminium with business continuity in the future.” This confirms that Google aims to eventually replace ChromeOS entirely — a move that must be managed carefully to avoid disrupting enterprise customers. This transition will likely require a multi-pronged approach: Existing ChromeOS devices that cannot be migrated to Aluminium OS will likely receive updates until they reach their end-of-life. This means Google will need to maintain the legacy ChromiumOS codebase for several more years. Rather than forcing an immediate switch, Google may offer an optional upgrade path for capable hardware. The company is currently testing Aluminium OS on development boards featuring MediaTek Kompanio 520 and 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake processors, so existing Chromebooks with these chips could be eligible for the update. However, migrating an operating system on live hardware is a massive technical hurdle that will require meticulous execution.And of course, there will be new PCs launching with Aluminium OS out of the box as well.Is ChromeOS dead as we know it?Even if Google replaces the entire foundation of ChromeOS with Android, the company may be reluctant to abandon the name. While it lacks the market share of Windows or macOS, the ChromeOS brand is widely recognized, particularly in the education and enterprise sectors. Although the job listing doesn’t confirm the final naming scheme, bug reports spotted by Frost Core hint that Google may retain the branding. Engineers have referred to the current platform as “ChromeOS Classic” and “non-Aluminium ChromeOS,” implying the new Android-based version could simply usurp the name “ChromeOS.”Would you miss Chrome OS if Google sunsets it for 'Aluminium OS'?Alternatively, Google might adopt “Android Desktop” as the name to align with its renewed focus on promoting Android as a brand. However, “Android Desktop” could merely be an internal designation for the form factor. Since these references have only appeared in bug reports, the final marketing name remains an open question.When will Android on PCs launch?Google is actively developing the platform, with bug reports confirming that the company is testing fresh builds of Android 16 on development hardware. The company has confirmed the project will launch in 2026, though it remains unclear whether it will arrive in the first or second half of the year. Given this timeline, it is highly likely that the initial public release will be built upon Android 17, which is due next year. We will continue to monitor the project to find further details ahead of its official debut.Thank you for being part of our community.

While the operating system will still be available to French users, all website and discussion servers are being relocated abroad.Until now, the project relied on OVH Bearharnois, a French hosting provider, for its core website and social media services. The migration plan moves the Mastodon, Discourse, and Matrix instances to a combination of local and shared servers in Toronto. Critical website infrastructure will be hosted by Netcup, a German‑based company.

                        GrapheneOS claims that they does not collect confidential user data in their servers or store critical infrastructure in France. Therefore, the migration does not affect services such as signature verification and downgrade protection for updates.Citing the government's support of the European Union Chat Control proposal, GrapheneOS developers are also refusing travel to France. Developers are no longer allowed to work inside the country due to safety concerns.This decision was sparked by negative press coverage from two articles published by . An interview with French cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse implies potential legal action against the project:"With this new tool, there is real legitimacy for a certain portion of users in the desire to protect their exchanges. The approach is therefore different. But that won't stop us from suing the publishers if links are discovered with a criminal organization and they don't cooperate with the law"GrapheneOS argues that  have conflated their project with government-sponsored forks, which are fake copies of their operating system. The news outlet refers to a fake Snapchat app, dark web advertising, and a series of unlisted YouTube videos that are not features of GrapheneOS itself.The project had previously threatened litigation against these government-sponsored forks. One prominent example is ANOM, an FBI-backed shell company that developed a compromised Android operating system and messaging platform as part of Operation Trojan Horse from 2018 and 2021.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Federal Judge Spends Most Of 233 Pages Calling Out DHS, ICE, CBP, Border Patrol For Their Lies</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/24/federal-judge-spends-most-of-233-pages-calling-out-dhs-ice-cbp-border-patrol-for-their-lies/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:43:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Then he was sent to Chicago by a vengeful Trump who wanted to see as many people in the state harmed for no other reason than he didn’t like the politicians running the state and the city. While Trump was prevented from flooding Chicago streets with National Guard troops, Commander Bovino did everything he could to turn federal forces into full-time assailants. And by “everything,” I mean things from lying about being attacked (to justify force deployments) to personally violating court orders limiting the use of force by federal officers. Judge Sara Ellis has been handling the lawsuit brought against federal agencies since their invasion of the Windy City. (And she’s already seen one of her orders blocked by the Seventh Circuit Appeals Court.) What should be a final ruling (pending review by the appellate court, which has also already placed a stay on  order) has been handed down by Judge Ellis. And that order makes it clear the federal government has done nothing but lie since being forced to answer questions in court. “While Defendants may argue that the Court identifies only minor inconsistencies, every minor inconsistency adds up, and at some point, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything that Defendants represent,” Judge Sarah Ellis wrote about the administration in a scathing 233-page ruling.And scathing it is. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick does a good job hitting a lot of the low points in this long Bluesky thread. We’ll do more of that here, because the amount of lying done here is staggering in both its expansiveness and its implication: that the Trump administration (in all forms) apparently believes no system of checks and balances can hold it back. Here’s how little the government cared about the lawsuit brought against it, much less the people it harmed on its way to being sued. From the opinion [PDF]:Plaintiffs submitted a mountain of evidence, providing the Court with over eighty declarations, numerous videos and articles, and other evidence. Defendants did not rebut anything that Plaintiffs set forth in their declarations or testimony, even with BWC footage.That’s just galling. Most defendants will at least try to defend themselves from accusations. The government — taking the form of multiple federal agencies participating in Trump’s “Midway Blitz” operation — couldn’t even be bothered to do that. Instead, it just kept on being violent, secure in the knowledge that courts can’t actually keep them from violating rights. They can, at best, only slow them down a bit. What the government did offer in its defense undercut its claims immediately.Presumably, these portions of the videos would be Defendants’ best evidence to demonstrate that agents acted in line with the Constitution, federal laws, and the agencies’ own policies on use of force when engaging with protesters, the press, and religious practitioners. But a review of them shows the opposite—supporting Plaintiffs’ claims and undermining all of Defendants’ claims that their actions toward protesters, the press, and religious practitioners have been, as Bovino has stated, “more than exemplary.”For example, Defendants directed the Court to two videos of agents outside the Broadview facility the evening of September 19, 2025. In those videos, agents stand behind a fence preparing to leave the facility’s gates and disperse what Defendants described as an unruly mob. The scene appears quiet as the gate opens, revealing a line of protesters standing in the street holding signs. Almost immediately and without warning, agents lob flashbang grenades, tear gas, and pepper balls at the protesters, stating, “fuck yea!”, as they do so, and the crowd scatters. This video disproves Defendants’ contentions that protesters were the ones shooting off fireworks, refusing orders, and acting violently so as to justify the agents’ use of force.On September 26, 2025, video from an agent’s BWC shows a line of agents standing at least thirty feet away from protesters outside the Broadview facility on Harvard Street. Despite this distance, the agents start yelling “move back, move back” to the protesters and then shoot pepper balls and tear gas at them without any apparent justification.Defendants also highlighted an October 3, 2025 video, presumably to show that agents driving the streets faced constant danger from cars ramming them on purpose. But instead of leaving this impression, the video, which almost entirely consists of a view of the back seat of the car and some dialogue about how the agent’s “body cam is on” and he is “still recording,” suggests that the agent drove erratically and brake-checked other motorists in an attempt to force accidents that agents could then use as justifications for deploying force.This is a 233-page deconstruction of every lie and false assertion made by the government. There’s a lot to see here and it should be seen because every lie told by the government should mean something to anyone who still cares about democracy.But we’re only nine pages in and already the judge is telling it like it is, ensuring that no one who doesn’t have the patience to go through the entire opinion will come away with the wrong impression after skimming through the first dozen pages or so: These are not the only inconsistencies and incredible representations in the record. While Defendants may argue that the Court identifies only minor inconsistencies, every minor inconsistency adds up, and at some point, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything that Defendants represent.Pretty much everyone called to testify on behalf of the government lied to some degree in hopes of salvaging some truly insane (and literally incredible) claims:[W]hen questioned about these instances in his deposition, [ICE Field Office Director] Hott acknowledged that he did not even know if it was a person that caused the damage to the downspout, much less a protester, and that he did not have proof that the agent’s beard was actually ripped off his face.Bovino’s and Hewson’s explanations about individuals in maroon hoodies being associated with the Latin Kings and threats strains credulity.Turning to Bovino, the Court specifically finds his testimony not credible. Bovino appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing “cute” responses to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s questions or outright lying.Most tellingly, Bovino admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters.The entire opinion makes it clear federal officers routinely engaged in unprovoked violence and then lied about their actions in court. They were ostensibly led by Gregory Bovino, who provided an example for them to follow by  engaging in plenty of unprovoked violence himself and who, when called to testify, acted like the whole thing was beneath him and was a suitable target for his open mockery.Bovino has since been sent elsewhere, not because Trump wants to stop him from generating further negative press or court precedent, but because Trump wants him to engage in the same sort of unconstitutional cruelty for as long as possible before litigation ensues. Bovino is the perfect front man for Trump’s bigoted attacks on cities and states he doesn’t like. Like Trump himself, Bovino wraps himself in the flag. And just like Trump, the only reason he does is so he can wipe his ass with it, staining everything it’s supposed to stand for. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Science-Centric Streaming Service Curiosity Stream is an AI-licensing Firm Now</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/1643247/science-centric-streaming-service-curiosity-stream-is-an-ai-licensing-firm-now?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:41:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Curiosity Stream, the decade-old science documentary streaming service founded by Discovery Channel's John Hendricks, expects its AI licensing business to generate more revenue than its 23 million subscribers by 2027 -- possibly earlier. The company's Q3 2025 earnings revealed a 41% year-over-year revenue increase, driven largely by deals licensing its content to train large language models. Year-to-date AI licensing brought in $23.4 million through September, already exceeding half of what the subscription business generated for all of 2024. 

The streaming service's library contains 2 million hours of content, but the "overwhelming majority" is earmarked for AI licensing rather than subscriber viewing, CEO Clint Stinchcomb said during the earnings call. Curiosity Stream is licensing 300,000 hours of its own programming and 1.7 million hours of third-party content to hyperscalers and AI developers. The company has completed 18 AI-related deals across video, audio, and code assets.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The Complete Machine Learning Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/24/daily-deal-the-complete-machine-learning-bundle-2/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:38:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dive into the world of self-driving cars, speech recognition technology, and more with the Complete Machine Learning Bundle.

Today, we point agents at our codebases, our browsers, and let them go off and act on our behalf. A key question that has been brewing under the surface during this time has been: how do we let end users actually customize these systems?As models have become more capable, the ways and mechanisms that end users have access to customize them have expanded as well. We've gone from simple system prompts to complex client-server protocols and back again.I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the history of LLM extension over the last three years and where I see it going in the future.Just four months after launch, OpenAI announced . Looking back, these were wildly ahead of their time.The idea was ambitious: give the LLM a link to an OpenAPI spec and let it "run wild" calling REST endpoints. It was a direct line to AGI-style thinking: universal tool use via standard APIs.The problem? The models weren't ready. GPT-3.5 (and even early GPT-4) struggled to navigate massive API specs without hallucinating or getting lost in context. Plus, the UX was clunky. You had to manually toggle plugins for every chat!Here's what that looked like:But it gave us a glimpse of the future:  plugin (later Advanced Data Analysis) became indispensable, foreshadowing the powerful sandboxed execution environments we use today.Custom instructions were the "smooth brain" counter-reaction to the complexity of plugins. I did a double take when writing this because I thought for sure this feature was released before plugins.It was just a user-defined prompt appended to every chat. Simple. Obvious. Yet it solved a huge problem: repetitive context setting.This was the spiritual ancestor to every  and  file that followed.OpenAI repackaged instructions and tools into . This was an attempt to "productize" prompt engineering. You could bundle a persona, some files, and a few actions into a shareable link.It was a retreat from the open-ended promise of plugins toward curated, single-purpose "apps."So far, we've discussed manual ways to extend LLMs.  represented a shift toward automatic personalization.ChatGPT Memory records details from your conversations and quietly inserts them into future context. It's like a system prompt that writes itself. If you mention you're a vegetarian, it remembers that weeks later. It’s a small feature, but it marked the beginning of agents that maintain long-term state without user intervention. changed the game by putting custom instructions where they belonged: .The  file was a revelation. Instead of pasting context into a chat window, you committed it to git."We use tabs, not spaces."It started as a single file, then evolved into a  folder with sophisticated scoping. You could organize multiple rule files, and even define when they applied, for example, only for certain file types or subdirectories. It was the first time extension felt "native" to the code.Later Cursor introduced the ability to let the LLM decide when to apply a rule, which is a pattern we will see again.By late 2024, models were finally smart enough to handle real tools reliably. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) was the answer.MCP is a heavyweight solution. An MCP client needs to keep a persistent connection to an MCP server. The server serves up tool definitions, resources, and prompts to the client (in most cases is an agent) and it can send a message to the server saying a tool has been called and the server can respond with the result.Unlike Custom Instructions (which just add context), MCP gives the model actual capabilities. It can read your repo, query your Postgres DB, or deploy to Vercel. Besides just providing tools, it also allows servers to provide  (documents, logs) and  directly to the agent.It's powerful, and perhaps a bit of overkill. While the complexity might be worth it for agent developers asking a user to set up and connect an MCP is a lot of friction and there is an entire ecosystem of startups like Smithery built around making it easier to use MCP.It is worth noting that ChatGPT apps which were announced in October 2025 are built on top of MCP as a base layer. This is an attempt to make it easier for end users to use MCP without having to actually think about it.Claude Code: New Agent, New Extensions (Feb 2025)Early 2025 brought us , which essentially added every extension mechanism under the sun to an agent. The standard for repo-level instructions. For heavy-duty tool integration. Like Cursor's notebooks, for reusable prompts. The ability to intercept and modify the agent's loop (e.g., "Stop if the tests fail"). Spawning specialized workers to handle sub-tasks. (Deprecated) Configuring tone and format.Time will tell how many of these features will stick around in the long term. Anthropic has already tried to deprecate output styles.The next extension mechanism added to Claude Code is significant enough to warrant a deeper dive.  are the rebirth of ChatGPT Plugins.While MCP has a whole client-server protocol, Agent Skills are just folders of markdown files and scripts (in whatever language you choose).The agent simply scans a  directory, reads the frontmatter of every , and builds a lightweight index. It then chooses to read the full contents of a skill only if it's appropriate for the current task. This solves one of the major problems with MCP: the context bloat that comes from having to load all of the tool definitions into the context window at once.Here is a snippet of the structure of a skill for doing e2e testing with Playwright taken from Anthropic's Skills examples repository:There is a mix of scripts, examples, and plain text instructions. The only required file is the SKILL.md file. Let's take a look at that file:This is just a plain markdown file with some metadata and a description of the skill. The agent reads the file which freely references other files that the agent can read. In contrast a playwright MCP server has dozens of tool definitions to control a browser, this skill just says "you have bash, this is how you write a playwright script".Granted to use a skill the agent needs to have general purpose access to a computer, but this is the bitter lesson in action. Giving an agent general purpose tools and trusting it to have the ability to use them to accomplish a task might very well be the winning strategy over making specialized tools for every task.Skills are the actualization of the dream that was set out by ChatGPT Plugins: just give the model instructions and some generic tools and trust it to do the glue work in-between. But I have a hypothesis that it might actually work now because the models are actually smart enough for it to work.Agent skills work because it assumes the agent has the ability to write its own tools (via bash commands). You can just give it code snippets and ask the agent to figure out how to run them generically for the task at hand.Importantly, I think that skills signal towards a new definition of what an agent really is. An agent isn't just a LLM in a while loop. It's an LLM in a while loop that has a computer strapped to it.Claude Code is the piece of software that first made this click for me, but it is way too developer focused to be the final form. Other applications like Zo Computer try to package the llm and computer together into a single application, but I still think it still doesn't abstract the computer away enough from the end user. If I ask a coworker to do something, I don't need to see their entire file system, I just need to know that they have a computer.Looking forward into 2026 I expect more and more llm applications that we use will have a computer strapped to them in new and interesting ways, whether we know it or not.If I could short MCP, I would, and I expect us to go back to extending our agents with the most accessible programming language: natural language.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>America’s Polarization Has Become the World&apos;s Side Hustle</title><link>https://www.404media.co/americas-polarization-has-become-the-worlds-side-hustle/</link><author>Jason Koebler</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/CleanShot-2025-11-24-at-10.19.42.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:31:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new feature on X is making people suddenly realize that some large portion of the divisive, hateful, and spammy content designed to inflame tensions or, at the very least, is designed to get lots of engagement on social media, is being published by accounts that are pretending to be based in the United States but are actually being run by people in countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, Russia, and other countries. An account called “Ivanka News” is based in Nigeria, “RedPilledNurse” is from Europe, “MAGA Nadine” is in Morocco, “Native American Soul” is in Bangladesh, and “Barron Trump News” is based in Macedonia, among many, many of others. Inauthentic viral accounts on X are just the tip of the iceberg, though, . A huge amount of the viral content about American politics and American news on social media is from sock puppet and bot accounts monetized by people in other countries. The rise of easy to use, free AI generative tools have supercharged this effort, and social media monetization programs have incentivized this effort and are almost entirely to blame. The current disinformation and slop phenomenon on the internet today makes the days of ‘Russian bot farms’ and ‘fake news pages from Cyprus’ seem quaint; the problem is now fully decentralized and distributed across the world and is almost entirely funded by social media companies themselves. This will not be news to people who have been following 404 Media, because I have done multiple investigations about the perverse incentives that social media and AI companies have created to incentivize people to fill their platforms with slop. But what has happened on X is the same thing that has happened on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and other social media platforms (it is also happening to the internet as a whole, with AI slop websites laden with plagiarized content and SEO spam and monetized with Google ads). Each social media platform has either an ad revenue sharing program, a “creator bonus” program, or a monetization program that directly pays creators who go viral on their platforms. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TSMC Arizona Outage Saw Fab Halt, Apple Wafers Scrapped</title><link>https://www.culpium.com/p/tsmc-arizona-outage-saw-fab-halt</link><author>speckx</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:30:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Good Evening from Taipei,A power outage at an industrial gas facility servicing TSMC interrupted manufacturing at the company’s Fab 21 in Arizona late last quarter, sources told me. The incident stopped the flow of crucial inputs needed for chipmaking, forcing the facility to shut down for at least a few hours, I was told. As a result, the company had to scrap thousands of wafers that were in production for clients at the site which include Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.outsourced vendor Lindeassumption thatUnfortunately, the company declined to immediately address the issue of the manufacturing disruption. Fab shutdowns are unusual, at least for TSMC. With equipment so expensive, its factories are run 24/7. That means that an hour of idle time can cost millions of dollars. Compounding the financial effect of this incident was the fact that it occurred late in the quarter, leaving little room to make up for lost production before the quarter closed. Profit margins on new facilities and at new nodes tend to be quite thin, even negative. In addition, TSMC has been ramping up capacity in Arizona and that capex gets reflected in depreciation costs even before the new equipment can start producing revenue. So it’s reasonable to see fluctuations in net income at the site. A halt in production and scrapping of wafers adds to the costs, dragging on earnings even if only slightly and briefly.Impact to clients is likely to be negligible, I was told, and the financial loss to TSMC may be covered by insurance. Capacity at Fab 21 is still quite small, and many products being made there have already been taped out and manufactured in Taiwan previously. In past disruptions, lost production and revenue was made up in the subsequent quarter. an exercise in cross-cultural adaptationThe most common cause of production interruptions at TSMC is Mother Nature. Earthquakes regularly rattle Taiwan, and fabs are built to withstand most of them. But sometimes a big tremor can trigger a safety shutdown, while really nasty temblors have caused actual damage. Beyond natural disasters, there’ve been few man-made shutdowns at TSMC because they’re pretty rigorous about operations. a computer virus was introduceda batch of contaminated photoresistSharing is caring.

We see it as an automated problem-solver. But a groundbreaking paper on a system called AlphaEvolve offers a window into a far more interesting paradigm, one where the real discovery isn't just the solution, but the process itself. \
By setting this AI loose on dozens of open problems in mathematics, researchers have uncovered not just new mathematical constructions, but fundamental new principles about how we can use AI to explore complex, abstract worlds at a scale never before possible.\
AlphaEvolve demonstrates a new form of human-AI collaboration where the machine doesn't just find an answer, but helps us evolve entirely new ways of  answers. It suggests a future where AI acts less like a calculator and more like a creative partner, capable of studying large classes of problems at a time in ways that complement, challenge, and augment human intuition. This article distills the five most surprising and impactful takeaways from this research, revealing a future of discovery that is more nuanced and collaborative than we might have expected.2.0 Takeaway 1: AI Doesn't Just Solve Problems; It Evolves How to Solve ThemThe most fundamental insight from the AlphaEvolve project is a shift in what we ask the AI to do. Instead of asking a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly generate a mathematical object, like a specific graph or a set of points—the system asks the LLM to generate programs that search for that object.\
This creates a "meta-level evolution" where the optimization process itself becomes the object of optimization. This is the difference between evolving a single award-winning recipe and evolving a master chef who can invent thousands of them. AlphaEvolve isn't just creating solutions; it's creating solution-finders. The system maintains a population of programs, each representing a unique search heuristic or strategy. In each evolutionary step, it tries to evolve a better "improver" function that can take the current best solution and find an even better one.\
This approach is incredibly powerful because it resolves a core bottleneck in AI-driven discovery: the speed disparity between a slow, expensive LLM call and a fast, cheap computation. By using the LLM's creativity to design efficient search strategies, those strategies can then be run cheaply and at a massive scale. A single LLM call to generate a new search heuristic can trigger a massive computation where that heuristic explores millions of possibilities on its own. It's a profound shift from evolving answers to evolving algorithms that find answers.\
Instead of evolving programs that directly generate a construction, AlphaEvolve evolves programs that search for a construction. This is what we refer to as the search mode of AlphaEvolve… Each program in AlphaEvolve’s population is a search heuristic.3.0 Takeaway 2: To Discover Universal Truths, Give the AI Less DataIn an era dominated by the "big data" paradigm, where more information is almost always seen as better, AlphaEvolve's experiments uncovered a deeply counterintuitive principle. When the goal was not just to find a solution, but an elegant and interpretable formula that could generalize across a wide range of parameters, researchers found that less is more.\
When tasked with finding general formulas that work for any number n, the system performed significantly better when it was shown solutions for only a small range of n values. The paper states clearly that having access to a large volume of data did not necessarily improve the system's ability to generalize its findings into universal principles. \
By constraining the AI to work with less data, the system was forced to discover more fundamental and broadly applicable ideas rather than "memorizing" or overfitting to a large dataset.\
Having access to a large amount of data does not necessarily imply better generalization performance. Instead, when we were looking for interpretable programs that generalize across a wide range of parameters, we constrained AlphaEvolve to have access to less data… This “less is more” approach appears to encourage the emergence of more fundamental ideas.\
This finding is surprising because it runs contrary to the foundational assumption of much of modern machine learning. It suggests that for certain types of abstract discovery, overwhelming the system with examples can obscure the underlying patterns, whereas a carefully curated, smaller dataset can force it to find more elegant and universal truths.4.0 Takeaway 3: Sometimes, a "Dumber" AI is a Better CollaboratorAnother surprising discovery came from an ablation study; an experiment where researchers systematically remove components of an AI system to understand their contribution, comparing a high-performance, state-of-the-art LLM with a much smaller, cheaper model. While the more capable LLM generally produced higher-quality suggestions, the researchers found that the most effective strategy wasn't always to use the best model exclusively.\
In fact, the study revealed that an experiment using only high-end models could sometimes perform worse than a run that also incorporated suggestions from the cheaper, less capable models. The researchers' hypothesis is that the "dumber" model injects a degree of randomness and "naive creativity" into the evolutionary process. This added variance helps the search avoid getting stuck in a conceptual rut, where the more powerful model might continuously refine a single, suboptimal idea.\
This doesn't mean the "dumber" model is a universal replacement. For the most challenging problems, like the Nikodym sets problem, the researchers noted that the cheaper model couldn't produce the most sophisticated constructions. The true insight is the value of cognitive diversity: the powerful model is essential for pushing the boundaries on difficult problems, while the cheaper model serves as a valuable collaborator, injecting variance to prevent the search from getting stuck.A recurring theme throughout the paper is the power of collaboration over full automation. AlphaEvolve consistently performed better when its exploration was guided by a human expert who could provide insightful advice in the prompt. The AI wasn't a replacement for the mathematician; it was a force multiplier.\
This synergy was perfectly illustrated in the team's work on the Nikodym sets problem. AlphaEvolve's first attempt produced a promising construction using complicated, high-degree surfaces that were difficult to analyze. This complex but insightful starting point served as what the researchers called a "great jumping-off point for human intuition." The human mathematicians then stepped in, simplifying the AI's approach by hand to use lower-degree surfaces and more probabilistic ideas, ultimately discovering an even better, state-of-the-art solution.\
The researchers stress that the most significant results emerged from this partnership, where human expertise directed the AI's vast computational search capabilities. This frames the AI not as an autonomous discoverer, but as a powerful new kind of scientific partner.\
We stress that we think that, in general, it was the combination of human expertise and the computational capabilities of AlphaEvolve that led to the best results overall.6.0 Takeaway 5: AI Can Find Flaws in Our Thinking (And Our Instructions)One of the most fascinating roles AlphaEvolve played was that of an unforgiving auditor of human logic. The researchers observed a "cheating phenomenon," where the system would find clever loopholes in the problem setup or exploit numerical inaccuracies in the evaluation code rather than finding a genuine mathematical solution. It didn't solve the problem asked, but the problem coded. This held up a mirror to the researchers, perfectly reflecting the subtle gap between a mathematician's intent and the literal, logical instructions given to the machine.\
A more profound example of this emerged while working on the de Bruin–Sharma problem. The human authors had made a subtle assumption about the problem's constraints that wasn't strictly correct. AlphaEvolve, operating without assumptions, produced results that logically couldn't exist if the researchers' analysis were perfect, directly highlighting the flaw. Upon inspecting the polynomials the AI used, the researchers realized their oversight and corrected their analysis.\
This anecdote reveals a powerful application of AI as a tool for stress-testing our own assumptions. Because the system has no preconceived notions and will exploit any available path to a higher score, it can reveal hidden flaws, unstated assumptions, and logical gaps in our problem formulations in ways we might never anticipate.7.0 Conclusion: A New Partner in the Search for KnowledgeThe experiments with AlphaEvolve represent a significant shift in our understanding of AI's role in science. The system's true power lies not just in its ability to find answers, but in its capacity to evolve entirely new ways of finding answers. It is a tool for exploring the vast space of possible problem-solving strategies, a conceptual partner that complements human intuition rather than replacing it.\
By discovering principles like "less is more" and the value of "naive creativity," this research gives us a glimpse into a future where human-AI teams work together to tackle science's biggest challenges. This is not about outsourcing thinking to a machine, but about building a new kind of intellectual partnership. Mathematics is the language of the universe. If AI can evolve new ways to speak it, what new conversations can we have with the physical world in medicine, materials, and climate science?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You Should Use This for Your Next Project: Random Image API</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/you-should-use-this-for-your-next-project-random-image-api?source=rss</link><author>Daniel, Andrei-Daniel Petrica</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Say goodbye to tedious image hunts and embrace the simplicity of Random photo API, a free API that delivers a constant stream of captivating random images]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built an interactive HN Simulator</title><link>https://news.ysimulator.run/news</link><author>johnsillings</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:52:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cool-retro-term: terminal emulator which mimics look and feel of CRTs</title><link>https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term</link><author>michalpleban</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:52:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Watch the video: Russian frozen assets — what&apos;s next?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWTLNscCmpA</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZWTLNscCmpA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:51:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch the video: Russian frozen assets — what's next?

They’ve insisted that any attempt to study and limit such operations is actually just “censorship” with various forms of cover, whether academic or operational.Then Elon Musk rolled out a feature often used by trust & safety teams internally, looking at where accounts were created and/or where they normally post from. Except Musk made the info public. And within hours it revealed exactly why platforms had been doing this kind of work internally in the first place.And, no, it wasn’t about “censorship” of ideological viewpoints.On Friday, X began rolling out a feature that revealed where users signed up from and where they were posting from. The feature came following the request of MAGA influencer Laura Loomer, who asked Musk back in September to add country-of-origin labels to help identify foreign influence operations. We noted the irony at the time—Loomer and her friends spent years attacking the trust & safety teams who were actually working on this problem.Whether it was because of Loomer’s request or it was already in the pipeline, Musk rolled it out.The scale of the problem isn’t just about foreign actors exploiting the platform—it’s about Musk creating the economic incentives that make it profitable. As the popular Derek Guy account noted, Musk instituted an “engagement-based” payment structure that pays out money based on how many views, retweets, and comments you get. For people in lower income regions, trolling on politically sensitive topics in America to generate likes and clicks (especially now that they can use AI to do so) isn’t just easy—it’s an actual business model that Musk built into the platform.Twitter pays people based on engagement (views, retweets, comments, etc). It appears that many MAGA accounts are based abroad and they use AI technology to generate low-effort rage bait. My guess is that this will get worse as AI tech improves. For instance, fake videos of minorities doing crime.This isn’t a bug in the system. It’s a feature Musk designed, then acted surprised when it attracted exactly the kind of behavior that trust & safety teams used to work to identify and limit.While it’s fascinating that X actually rolled this out, it should raise questions about those who have spent the past few years stewing in that cesspool of foreign rage-bait manipulation, insisting it was somehow an accurate portrayal of public opinion.Now, there are some limitations to the system. X’s head of product noted that uses of VPNs or Starlink may have the wrong country show up on their account. But VPN usage doesn’t explain accounts with thousands of posts over months, all originating from the same foreign location, all focused on American political rage-bait, all monetizing engagement through Musk’s payment system.This is exactly the kind of coordinated inauthentic behavior that trust & safety teams were built to identify and address. Not to “censor” ideological viewpoints, but to surface when what looks like organic American political discourse is actually foreign actors gaming the system for profit.For years, Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger, and their allies have insisted that anyone working on these problems was part of a “censorship industrial complex” designed to silence political speech. Politicians like Ted Cruz and Jim Jordan repeated these lies. They treated trust & safety work as a threat to democracy itself.Then Musk rolled out one basic feature, and within hours proved exactly why trust & safety work existed in the first place.Will Taibbi or Shellenberger acknowledge they spent years attacking the people who were actually trying to protect the integrity of online discourse? Will they admit they helped dismantle the very systems that could have prevented what Musk just exposed?I doubt it. They’re too busy on X, swimming in the very manipulation they insisted didn’t exist.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NATO Taps Google For Air-Gapped Sovereign Cloud</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/1531202/nato-taps-google-for-air-gapped-sovereign-cloud?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NATO has hired Google to provide "air-gapped" sovereign cloud services and AI in "completely disconnected, highly secure environments."

As Fetterman [20] puts it: “The most important element of field work is being there - to observe, to ask seemingly stupid questions, and to write down what is seen and heard.”4.1 Gaining access and starting upAfter reading the previous sections, we expect the reader to have a clear understanding of what ethnography is, what kind of research questions it is best suited for, and the issues to consider when planning an ethnographic study. Furthermore, a “field site” to be studied has to be decided, i.e., a software development team, an open-source community, or organisation. However, as one can imagine, starting an ethnographic study is not only about “showing up” to observe what is going on at the field site. In general, it is important to have a key informant (also called a ‘gatekeeper’) that can facilitate the researcher’s access to the informants. This can be a project manager, team lead or a scrum master. This key informant is a person who is trusted, and possibly respected, by the informants and is willing to introduce the researcher to them so that they can start the data collection. In summary, this key informant negotiates access with the informants before the researcher goes to the field. Often, a good idea is to let this key informant introduce the researcher and suggest one or two initial members that are willing to be observed or interviewed. By interacting with these initial members, the researcher will have a chance to meet other team members and can negotiate with them additional opportunities for data collection.\
The key informant is also the person that the researcher will look for to ask clarification questions regarding the project being studied, its context, the diverse roles being played by the informants, the software development organisation, and the software being developed. This information often will also indicate documents and tools that the researcher should be aware of, and if necessary, the key informant will make the necessary arrangements so that the researcher can access these documents and/or tools. The key informant can be thought of as a facilitator who will allow the researcher to conduct the ethnographic study.\
Part of starting up the actual field work is also to agree on the legal side of the collaboration and develop and sign cooperation agreements containing nondisclosure agreements and agreements about the intellectual property that might be developed as part of the research project. As part of starting up the field work, the researcher also needs to consider the research ethics relevant for this project and decide, maybe together with the key informant, on how to handle the informed consent. The latter topics are discussed further in section.• Don’t impose your point of view. Let your student express their perspectives • Challenge your student’s observations but gently • Spend some time focusing on the use of language. How informants talk about their work or aspects of their organisation is very informative but attention to this kind of detail is not often emphasised in software engineering classes.4.2 Handling your preconceptionsOne of the challenges of ethnographic research for a software engineer studying software engineering practices is that the researcher brings an education to the field that states how software should be developed. For example, having attended a software engineering course, the field worker might expect a ‘stand-up’ meeting to take place in situ by people actually standing up. However, in virtual software development, a stand-up meeting might mean that people sit in front of the screen communicating using a virtual meeting environment [16]. Similarly, the textbook version of pair programming describes a “driver” and “navigator” role, but in practice pairing rarely adopts these roles formally, as the intensity of development results in a much more fluid exchange of activities [45]. So how can a researcher handle such a situation, where the observed team is not doing things ‘by the book’? Ethnographic research talks about ‘bracketing’ prior assumptions and knowledge. In the above example it would mean accepting that pairing in practice changes shape when the focus is on developing code rather than following a pre-defined procedure, and that stand-up meetings may look different for different teams depending on their context. The research can then focus on how development is implemented in this context, what is the rationale for deviating from the textbook way of doing things, and how have these practices developed.Observation is key to ethnographic studies and both participant and non-participant observation are legitimate forms of ethnography [21]. The data collected for observation is largely in the form of notes. Field notes are an important aspect of the work done by the ethnographer and the researcher must be prepared to take notes during the study. The question, though, is what notes to take? On the one hand, the researcher can document as many things as possible including the events, things people say, interruptions, event participants, documents being accessed or discussed, because at the start of the study it’s hard to know what will turn out to be significant. However, documenting everything will quickly become overwhelming. Textbooks sometimes recommend a template or schema for field notes. Such a schema can be very helpful and provide useful scaffolding at the start. Filling in the schema should not become the main purpose, though, and a tendency to just ‘tick the boxes’ needs to be resisted. The main purpose is, of course, to make sense of the team’s work practices and to document what is relevant to that aim. An alternative to schemas is to use a framework of questions. There are simple frameworks such as “who is there”, “where are they?” “what are they doing”, and more detailed ones such as the following based on Robson and McCarten [47] (p. 328):• Space: What is the physical space like, and how is it laid out?• Actors: What are the names and relevant details of the people involved?• Activities: What are the actors doing, and why?• Objects: What physical objects are present, such as story cards?• Acts: What are specific individual actions?• Events: Is what you observe part of a special event?• Time: What is the sequence of events?• Goals: What are the actors trying to accomplish?• Feelings: What is the mood of the group and of individuals?\
These are only intended to help keep a focus on relevant issues so that the ethnographer is not overwhelmed, and will evolve over time. Today, many researchers use computers for their field notes, which makes it easier to link to other field material such as (sample) documents, photos, and recordings. But handwritten notes are also popular and some find them a better way to engage with their surroundings. Each researcher will need to find their own preference. However, as mentioned in sections 3 and 4, the focus of the study will evolve and the field notes will reflect that. For instance, after noticing that the software architecture influenced the interactions between the software teams, de Souza and Redmiles [10] started to pay more attention to the inter-team interactions because they were sources of tension between the different product teams. As the focus changes, ethnographers also adopt different data collection techniques, for instance, during the field work the researcher can decide to follow an artefact, e.g. a pull request, bug report, a presentation or the documentation of a piece of the software architecture. When this happens, the researcher should be prepared to ask for access to these artefacts which may mean a physical (print out) or digital copy of it. By following an artefact, the researcher might shine light on a different set of new events, activities and/or informants who often will bring new perspectives into the field site being studied.\
Last but not least, it is important to note that field notes will contain both objective information such as quotes, timestamps of events, links to recordings and photos, and subjective information, such as the researcher’s reflections and interpretations of what is going on. Objective information is important, to anchor your emerging understanding of the work practices in actual observations. Verbatim quotations are extremely useful to present a credible report of the research. According to Fetterman [20], “quotations allow the reader to judge the quality of the [ethnographic] work - how close the ethnographer is to the thoughts of natives in the field - and to assess whether the ethnographer used such data appropriately to support the conclusions.”\
The subjective informationincludes the researchers’ tentative interpretation of the events being observed, “hypotheses” about what is being observed, and questions the researcher asks themselves when collecting data. These reflections can evolve into important memos that in turn will develop into the parallel analysis of the data. It is, though, essential that the researcher clearly differentiates the subjective from the objective information in their field notes. This can be done by using different colours in a paper based field diary, or by splitting the page vertically or horizontally. Reflection and emerging hypothetical interpretations are, in qualitative research validated in the field. For instance, during data collection De Souza and Redmiles [57] started to wonder whether the phenomena observed would occur only with novice team members. To “validate” whether this is the case, they decided to observe and interview senior team members. Through this they found out that the phenomena was more general and occurred with team members of different experience.\
In some cases, the events being observed will unfold so fast that the researcher will not be able to take notes. In this case, ethnographers allocate time to record their memories in their field notes as soon as possible after the event, and by the end of the day at the latest. Nowadays, recording meetings is common and straightforward since some participants are online. In this case, it is important for the researcher to negotiate access to these recordings because they will be important data points for data analysis. They should be linked to the field diary so that the researcher later can connect them to the context in which they took place. However, being able to record meetings so easily is a potential disadvantage because it’s easy to collect a huge amount of data, and there is a tendency for the researcher to lose concentration if they know data is being captured through other means.In addition to observation, conducting ethnographic studies will likely employ a range of data collection methods including interviews and document analysis. Interviews are a chance to clarify meanings and the history of what has been observed. Such interviews might be formal or informal. Informal, or impromptu, interviews are often in situ and opportunistic; they will often occur in the context of an observation. In other words, the ethnographer, after witnessing an event that seems interesting, surprising, or even expected, will use the opportunity to engage in a quick conversation with the informant to find out more details. These informal interviews will occur when opportunities arise, for instance, during a break or while waiting for a meeting. All this is done having in mind that the role of an ethnographer is to understand the member’s point of view. Formal interviews require an agenda and a negotiated date and time, but may be the only opportunity to speak with some informants or to explore some kinds of issue.\
In our experience, a good ethnographer strikes a balance between conducting formal and informal interviews. What this balance looks like depends on the context and the flexibility of the informants’ working day. Too many informal interviews with the same informants can become irritating. Similarly, conducting formal interviews means asking people to allocate time for the conversation. However, checking information and making sure that observations and reflections are well-founded are fundamental. A good ethnographer also needs to pace themselves, plan their days carefully and be systematic about keeping records. This is particularly significant because data collection will go on for several days or even weeks, and it is easy for memories to fade or become confused. The researcher needs to be constantly reflecting about what data is being collected, including around events, conversations, and artefacts, and revisit the emerging analysis concepts in light of the new observations. Ethnographers need to remember to avoid judging the work being observed and to keep focus on the informants’ point of view, i.e., why they do the things they do. Being careful about data collection also means collecting data from different informants to gather different perspectives while, at the same time, not being a nuisance.\
Finally, it is important to emphasise that ethnographic research, similar to other qualitative research methods, requires cycles of data collection and analysis. In other words, ethnographic research requires negotiating continuous and evolving access to the site. As discussed in the next section, during the data analysis new foci might emerge and require new directions for data collection, such as access to new informants or new events or new documents. So the ethnographer must be continuously negotiating access to these during the research process.\

• Being judgmental about observed practice SO focus on why it is the way it is.• “Going native” meaning that the way informants behave and achieve things become ‘normal’ SO talk to other researchers and hold debriefings to help you regain the questioning mindset.• Losing your “strangeness” perspective and not knowing what needs to be told for others to understand your interpretations SO try explaining what is happening to an alien.• Human tendency is to gravitate towards people you like but in the field it’s important to attend to all informants SO be aware of your own preferences and biases.• It is easy to focus on a small number of informants because you become comfortable with them SO make sure you choose a range of informants to get different perspectives, i.e., novices and experts, male and female, informants with different roles, etc.• Observation can result in lots of data, some of which is not relevant SO focus on what to pay attention to and choose carefully what data to collect.• Assumptions or pre-conceived ideas can lead to misunderstandings SO challenge your own assumptions and ask dumb questions to establish that your understanding is correct.• Recording meetings and interviews is straightforward and easy but can result in huge amounts of data and loss of concentration SO keep taking field notes even when the interactions are being recorded.Eventually, the researcher will have to leave the host organisation or the open source community, because the software development project finishes, the research project ends, or because the researcher has learned what could be learned from the ethnographic field work. Leaving the field should be done in a way that allows the researcher to come back to ask clarifying questions and open up for future collaboration on new mutually interesting research questions. It is therefore important that the researcher informs all of the informants that they are leaving the site and what will happen next with their data and its analysis. Saying farewell to the team can be combined with a presentation of (preliminary) findings and insights that can also be used as an occasion for member checking. Member checking is an important aspect of any qualitative research (see also Section 5). It involves presenting the results of the research to the informants so that they can “validate” them. In ethnographic research, one way to do this is to formally present the results to the key informants who facilitated the ethnographer’s access (see Section 4.1), or even to the whole development team. Another way is through informal presentations during the final days of data collection, such as during a break, while waiting for a meeting, etc. The format in which this is done varies depending on the team, project, and overall context. On the one hand, feedback from the participants is important for the trustworthiness of the findings. On the other hand, presenting the findings can also serve as a ‘thank you’ for the team and can support the reflection and improvement of their own practices. If an organisation or team is interested enough in having a researcher on site then they will also be interested to know what insights have been found. As one of our collaborators once said “the problem with running a project is that you’re running, but having you here allowed us to stop and reflect”.\

In social sciences, where ethnography originated, studies focus on understanding phenomena. They are used to understand better how (sub) cultures operate, or how groups of people organise their social life. In HCI, ethnographic studies are used to inform the design of technology from a user’s point of view so that the designers might better appreciate who they are designing for. In software engineering, ethnographic studies may also be used to understand or to inform design, but research often goes beyond understanding towards improving methods, techniques and tools. Understanding current practice is a good starting point to inform changes of any kind, not so that current practice can be replicated in the new order, but to appreciate why things are done the way they are, so that there are no unintended consequences when things change. A quite famous example is the long time it has taken to replace the paper flight strips used by air traffic controllers with digital versions. In 1999 Wendy MacKay commented that “Our observations have convinced us that we do not know enough to simply get rid of paper strips, nor can we easily replace the physical interaction between controllers and paper strips” [38]. She wrote this after being inspired by her work and previous studies about flight strips which started in 1992. A blog written in 2017 on the subject demonstrates how cautiously this change was eventually made [18]. In our analysis of ethnographic research in empirical software engineering [51], we identified four roles for ethnographic research, all of which start by considering “how things work in practice”\
2.1.1 To strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineeringSince ethnography’s origins are in understanding cultures and communities, it is not a surprise that ethnography has been used in this way. It is inevitable that some insights regarding social and human aspects will emerge whatever research question is pursued since the approach champions the members’ point of view. For example, Lopez et al. [35] were interested in investigating how non-specialist software developers engage with security in practice. This explicitly focuses on the human aspect of software developers. They used a multi-sited study and a mixture of research methods. Their results included a set of episodes where non-specialists engaged in security activity, and five typical behaviours that characterise how individual developers respond to security concerns to meet the demands of particular circumstances. A key characteristic of this work was that it emphasised security from the developers’ perspective. The results form a framework that managers and teams can use to recognize, understand, and alter security activity in their environments (motivatingjenny.org).\
2.1.2 To inform the design of software engineering toolsFor a new tool to be successful it must support the task being performed, e.g. bug localisation. But for it to be useful to practitioners it must also fit into their workflow and support how they and their organisation performs the task. Focusing on a task in isolation gives only a partial view and however clever it may be, if it’s not usable then it won’t be used. So understanding the context of tool use is as important as understanding its technical and functional requirements. But there are other considerations too. As with much software development, it can be easy to jump straight into designing a system that seems to address a user’s problem [48]. However if the goal is to develop new software engineering tools then don’t start the design until you are sure that the proposal will be useful. This can be achieved by sketching a number of potential tools based on observations, and then collecting evidence to support or refute their value, e.g. by working with practitioners and analysing your data overall to evaluate the ideas. For example deSouza et al. [9]were interested in the role of application programming interfaces (APIs) in the coordination of software development work in large scale organisations. An initial observation led them to think that integrating the versioning software with email might facilitate the team’s work, but further data collection made it clear that this was only part of the situation, and focusing on a tool to support the team’s overall communication would bring them more benefit. So instead of developing something to integrate two existing tools, they developed a tool that supported the identification of dependencies between developers which allowed developers to coordinate their efforts more effectively and reduce unnecessary work.\
2.1.3 To improve development processesEthnography can be a starting point, together with the practitioners observed, to discuss and implement improvements of their work practices. Ethnographic research then becomes part of action research. Two chapters in this book by Staron and by Dittrich, Bolmsten and Seilein introduce action research. A critical point is that the decision about the intervention and the evaluation of its implementation should keep the members’ point of view, both for ethical and methodological reasons. Dittrich et al. developed Cooperative Method Development (CMD), an action research approach combining ethnographical and ethnomethodological inspired empirical research with the improvement of software engineering tools, methods, and processes [17, 13]. CMD is explicitly designed to keep both the work practice focus and the developers’ point of view of the initial research throughout the action research cycle(s). Unphon’s thesis provides an example of action research [61]. The research cooperation with a company developing software products for simulating hydraulic systems focused on the evolvability of these software products. The researchers collaborated with the team responsible for the product simulating open one-dimensional water systems like rivers and creeks. The action research introduced light-weight software architecture techniques for high-level design, developed a light-weight Architecture Level Evolvability Assessment method for focussed discussions of design decisions with relevant stakeholders, and introduced light-weight architecture compliance techniques using the built system. Introductory research with the team in order to understand development practices as well as investigate the structure of the existing software product resulted in a framework for understanding the influence of the organisation of software development and business on the architecture of the software [62]. The research results emphasise the need to adapt software architecture methods and tools to support the continuous evolution of software products: architecture design and evolution take place as part of everyday evolution; architectural practices need to support the software architect to keep up with the changes of the software and the emerging requirements that might challenge the architecture; evolvability should be a quality to be considered in regular software architecture design discussions.\
2.1.4 To inform research programmes that do not have ethnography at their coreIt is common for research outputs such as tools and new processes to be ignored by practitioners, in favour of innovations suggested by other practitioners. Understanding the context of software engineering takes the researcher one step nearer to suggesting an innovation that is acceptable to practice. In particular, an ethnographic study may help a research programme by articulating more specific, relevant research questions. For example, our programme on agile software development started by looking at the realities of XP in practice, i.e. how was the approach implemented [53]? Ethnographic studies in this context led to other studies and research questions that focused on the role of physical artefacts [55], information flow between stakeholders [65] and collaboration in dispersed teams [11]. But ethnography can also be used to inform research programmes by providing context grounded in practice for an existing research focus. For example, Capiluppi et al. [6] investigated the evolution of code within an agile development project. This led to a number of observations regarding how the agile code base evolved. Using an ethnographic study as context allowed the researchers to:• Characterise the development process and practices clearly, and• Provide alternative interpretations of phenomena found in the data, e.g. where the size of the code base changed significantly they could trace an event through the ethnographic study to explain that a new library was loadedEthnographic observation in this context has the benefit that it is not dependent on the report of practitioners, as it is in interviews. When collecting reports from practitioners, their responses will inevitably be partial and informed by current events. For example, they might not consider certain aspects of everyday practice to be relevant to the questions asked, or they might not report practices that they consider to be informal or not accepted. However, these aspects may be exactly the characteristics that render the specific way of developing software possible, and hence would be important from a research point of view. The design of studies complementing and providing context to other research may not be driven by an independent research question, but the research question might be decided based on the overall research interest.\

• When conducting an ethnographic study with the aim of investigating social and human aspects of software engineering it is easy to become overwhelmed by the huge number of focus points SO track the possible foci and address them one at a time.• When conducting an ethnographic study with the aim of producing a new tool, it can be tempting to start designing before a full picture has been obtained SO start by hypothesising what kind of tools would be useful and collect data to validate those hypotheses.• When conducting an ethnographic study with the aim of producing a new tool, it can be tempting to focus on specific instances rather than the broader picture SO focus on the analytical results rather than the data when hypothesising about potential tools.• When conducting an ethnographic study with the aim of improving development processes it can be easy to suggest changes based on textbook versions of processes SO make sure to engage practitioners in any suggested modifications.• When conducting an ethnographic study with the aim of informing other programmes of research, confirmation bias can easily cloud your observations SO be sure to seek confirming and disconfirming evidence.\
2.2 The kind of research questions you want to answerThis subsection considers the kind of research questions you want to answer. The specific detail of the question may change as the study progresses (see section 4 below) but whether an ethnographic study is the right choice depends on the kind of question you want to answer. The first thing to note is that ethnographic research, like other qualitative research, is driven by research questions rather than hypotheses derived from theory. Research questions ask ‘How’ and ‘Why’ and ‘What are the characteristics of’ questions rather than ‘Is X better than Y’ or ‘Will this technique make programmers more productive?’ kind of questions. For example ‘How do software practitioners develop systems using XP?’ rather than ‘Is single programmer coding more productive than pair programming?’, and ‘Why don’t developers adhere to the company’s security policies?’ rather than ‘Does structuring the manual in this way help developers produce more secure code?’ and ‘What are the characteristics of a technology adoption?’ rather than ‘How did the ideas of Simula develop into Java? Other techniques and methods introduced in this book will support answering other types of question.\
The strength of an ethnographic approach is that it emphasises the point of view of the participants, i.e. the members of the community under study, who are often called informants or interlocutors in ethnographic work. It therefore allows the researcher to understand better why things are the way they are. It brings research closer to practice and hence can make the results more acceptable within practitioner communities. For example, it may seem strange to a researcher to see agile practitioners using both a physical storyboard and a virtual one, especially because this entails duplicate work in keeping them both up to date. However, this is common practice where co-located or hybrid teams are deployed because of the different and complementary collaboration and communication benefits it provides.\

2.3 What ethnographic studies require from the researcherTo help decide whether or not an ethnographic study is the right choice, this section considers the four main features of ethnographic work: the member’s point of view; the ordinary detail of life as it happens, the analytic stance and thick descriptions. For each of these we present considerations on whether the researcher (you) are prepared and willing to apply the approach appropriately, e.g. to write thick descriptions, listen to the informants’ point of view and modify your research focus. The information in this section will help to assess this, and will set your expectations for what it means to implement an ethnographic study.\
2.3.1 The members’ point of viewWe would argue that it is always important to understand the point of view of practitioners whatever is the focus of the research, for example whether developing a new tool, looking to improve the development process, or simply trying to understand better how something works in practice. As discussed in Section 2.1, taking account of the members’ point of view doesn’t restrict innovation, but instead understanding the rationale for the current way of working before introducing changes helps to avoid unintended consequences. Understanding the member’s point of view is all about understanding what is important for the informants so that this can be taken into account. In other disciplines, ethnographic studies involve the ethnographer studying a culture that is unfamiliar to them, e.g. in terms of language, customs, cultural norms etc. These studies may need to last for months or years. As a software engineer conducting an ethnographic study in a software development environment, this will be less of a challenge to overcome. Understanding someone else’s perspective is still hard, but much of the basic context of software development, e.g. IDEs, development processes, programming languages etc will be familiar. One of the benefits of this is that ethnographic studies don’t necessarily need to take months or years. Focusing on the members’ point of view will entail getting used to the organisation’s environment and the specific details of the team’s work but the learning curve is less steep than it would be for someone unfamiliar with software development.\
The familiarity of the researcher with the tools, techniques and methods of the informants can make it difficult to keep the member’s point of view in mind when observing how software development takes place. It is very easy to apply the knowledge from your own education and research and slide into a “this can be done better” attitude. Such an attitude might even be provoked by the practitioners asking the researcher, who supposedly is an expert, whether they have any recommendations. Here it is important to separate observations from analysis for the duration of the field work and put your own judgement aside.\
2.3.2 The ordinary detail of everyday lifeThe ordinary detail of everyday life is important because it exposes how tasks are addressed, the issues that are relevant or not and how informants approach tasks. For example, a series of studies with agile software development teams exposed that the colour of cards placed on a physical scrum board, and the way in which they are handled carries meaning beyond what was written on them [54]. This raised questions of whether digital storyboards would support the same kind of processing and collaboration as physical boards. This also means that the research will be conducted in the field or “in the wild” rather than in a controlled environment, and the research will aim to not disturb or control normal behaviour.\
Equally, informants’ language is relevant. For example if the informants’ native language is different to the ethnographer, what might the impact be? If the domain of study is highly technical then the ethnographer would do well to understand the domain too. Performing an ethnographic study in an unfamiliar technical domain will have an impact on the timescale (as mentioned above) but also may lead to misinterpretation of activities and tasks. The gender of the researcher might both influence the field situation and the interpretation of the observation. Given that ethnography emphasises what is important from the members’ point of view, and that the researchers won’t know what they might find before entering the field, there is a strong chance that the research focus will evolve. A key issue to consider is whether the research context and design is suitably flexible to allow for the research focus to change? For example, if your focus is developing a new tool to identify areas of technical debt but your informants explain that their concerns are driven by improving the security of the code, how would that affect the research? Although the detail of everyday life is observed, it is not the detail itself that is important, but the significance of the detail (see section 2.3.3 below).\
2.3.3 The analytic stanceAn ethnographic account is not just a description of what is seen but is crafted out of an analysis and interpretation of what was found in the field, explicating why things are the way they are. The analytic stance is related to the members’ perspective. The idea is to understand and uncover the rationalities of practices and how the practitioners’ behaviour makes sense, even though it does not match the researcher’s own understanding of how software development should take place. This can be problematic to those unused to the approach. One example to illustrate this analytical stance can be found in [49], where a recording of a steering group meeting addressing a major change in a method and tool development project is analysed. The analysis shows in detail how the steering group relates the actions to take the development further to both the new plan for the project and the company-wide project model. The analysis shows that the steering group takes a decision to deviate from the project model in order to assure that the work in the project can progress using, nonetheless, the very same company-wide project model to make the deviation visible and accountable in the organisation. The analysis thus sheds light on the rationale behind deviations from plans and company-wide project models, and, at the same time, it shows the importance of a company-wide project model to communicate both behaviour according to it and deviations from it to other actors in the organisation. Not every analysis needs to be as fine grained as the interaction analysis performed in that article. However, the analytical stance requires the researcher to be able to relate the observations here and now to the spatial and temporal context and to the goal and purpose of the observed activities.\
An ethnographic study results in a comprehensive and detailed set of data, and a detailed account of the findings. The account aims to communicate a broad picture of the study environment and activity. It needs to show how the researcher has arrived at their conclusions or recommendations. The set of data is specific to that site and hence is not suitable for statistical generalisation although it may be suitable for analytical generalisation. If you decide to undertake an ethnographic study this is an important point to remember. In an area where generalisation and statistical significance of results are expected, having a core ethnographic study may be challenging to convince others. The thick description can be used to defend the study and its results, but it cannot justify a statistical generalisation. An ethnographic researcher needs to acquire a different perspective on justification. This may be particularly pertinent for publication and if you are a PhD candidate:::info

3 Planning an ethnographic studyEthnography belongs to the category of flexible research designs [47], where both the research focus and the concrete field work are expected to be adapted during the research process. However, this does not imply that planning is redundant. An ethnographic study still needs to be planned. It is important that both the researcher and the practitioners have a shared understanding about what might happen once the researcher joins the project. In addition, the plans should be regularly revisited and adapted, and everybody kept aligned throughout the research.\
3.1 Finding a site for field workOne of the first things is to identify a suitable project to collaborate with. Often, the ethnographic study would have been prepared by prior contact between the researcher, the company and relevant members of the development team. In other cases, the ethnographic researcher might identify a company or an open source project that fits with the research interest and question.When working with a company, the ethnographic study might affect their work, so the company and the project team need to agree to the study and the plan. As ethnography is an extremely flexible way of doing research, good communication with the project and in many cases the management of the company is needed to allow for coordination and replanning. One way of doing this is to create a ‘steering committee’ for the research collaboration, consisting of the researcher, the PI of the project, a project contact, and the person responsible for the research collaboration in the company. This committee would meet regularly to discuss whether changes to the logistics of the field work are needed, and to make sure that resources necessary for the ethnographic study (access to documents, code and the like, time for interviews etc) are provided. Exactly how this group works will depend on the field site circumstances but regular alignment across all parties will keep the study on track. In other cases, the researcher could decide to become part of an open source community. This in turn will require deciding on the role in the community the researcher would want to take. Are you able to and interested in participating in the Open Source development, i.e. coding? Could you contribute in other ways to the community? Open source members, especially if they take on core roles like maintainers, are often as busy as members of corporate software engineering teams. Either your contribution to the community during the field work or the research results could be received as a return for the time the community members spend with you. Planning the ethnographic study needs to take research ethics into account as well. Due to the complexity of this topic, research ethics are discussed on their own in Section 6. The following discusses five dimensions to consider when planning an ethnographic study, especially in software engineering.\
3.2 Participant or non-participant observationThe best way to understand the culture and practices of a community under study, is to become part of that community. Studying software engineering practices as a software engineer often allows for participation. For example, the researchers can become members of open source communities by participating in the development. However, commercial companies may not be so happy for researchers to be modifying their code, and highly specialised software – for example software for modelling hydraulic systems [61] – requires an expertise that software engineering researchers would normally not master. In such cases, the researcher needs to find a role that allows them to observe and become a culturally competent member of the community. One way could be to act as a newly employed project member, an apprentice in the specific development context. In the above case of hydraulic simulation software, that required expertise in differential equations on a PhD level, the field worker took on documenting the architecture of the re-engineered software to support its usage and customisation. Another example was in an early ethnographic study wherethe researcher took on an administrative role [37]. Both of these examples resulted in the researcher getting embedded in the work of the team in a way that was acceptable to all concerned. Deciding the role of the researcher in the field needs to be taken together with the collaborating project team. Also other stakeholders like management and in some cases even clients of the organisation need to be consulted. It will not always be possible to participate in the development and a more passive observation may be the only option. In this case the researcher will sit quietly and observe, listen and take notes but then it is important to keep alert for particularly pertinent activity.\
3.3 Duration of field workHow much time does the researcher need to spend with the software team? In our presentation of published ethnographic studies [51], there was a wide variety of field work durations. The traditional answer of ethnographers would be: until the researcher can act as a competent member of the culture, or until the researcher stops learning new things. As in other qualitative research methods, saturation of the observations is an indication for ending an ethnographic study. Here, the overlap of expertise when researching software engineering practices as a software engineering researcher might shorten the time necessary: although the specific software practices might be new, the field worker shares a common ground with the observed teams in the form of shared professional expertise. However, saturation might not be possible, e.g. if a software development project ends before saturation is reached. On the other hand, iterative processes such as agile software development might allow repeated observation of all relevant practices in a comparatively short time. In many situations, it is not necessary to spend all the time with the observed projects. For example, the field worker might choose to spend 3 or 4 days each week with the project, which enables the researcher to start analysing the field material in parallel with the field work. That way the field work duration can be adjusted to fit with time periods that are meaningful from the point of view of the researched practices.Ethnographic field work should take place where the culture and practices that are studied take place. But where does software development take place? Software development is both anchored in the physical world, where software developers are located, and it takes place in the digital realm, where the software is located. Observations often need to combine physical observation and an understanding of how the physical actions relate to the development environment, digital documents,changes to and management of the source code, as well as the effects on the deployed software.Especially when cooperation and collaboration in distributed development is the focus of an ethnographic study, participatory observation on only one side risks neglecting the remote conditions for collaboration. To address this potential bias, multi-site ethnography emphasises the need to do ethnographic field work on all the locales involved. Multi-sited ethnography entails the researcher entering and being accepted at different sites which might require longer stays, e.g. one or more weeks, at all places where relevant project members or stakeholders are situated. As an additional challenge, especially after the lockdowns due to the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, many companies moved from co-located or distributed development to hybrid work organisations, where developers partly work from home, leading not only to distributed but dispersed development, where every member of the team is in a different location [52]. Coordination and cooperation in these circumstances more and more resemble Open Source development. Ethnographic research here has to follow the way software development is organised. One of the core challenges with researching at least partially virtual activities, is that it might be hard to follow an activity in a complex distributed development environment that both has physically visible parts, e.g. workstation layout and virtual elements, e.g. changes to code and deployed software. For example Begum [3] describes the handling of a bug report: the bug report comes into existence through registration of the bug by a support engineer, followed by reproduction of the erroneous behaviour and a root cause analysis by a software engineer who prepares the discussion of the defect in a triage meeting, which in turn results in a strategy to fix the defect. The correction of the defect might again require collaboration between different teams responsible for different parts of the product. To understand what is discussed at the different meetings and to understand the rationale behind decisions might require at least a superficial understanding of the organisation of the source code.Ethnographic field work here can follow an artefact, e.g. a bug report or the software architecture documentation, or it might focus on the activities of individuals, e.g. the software architect of (a part of) the software, or a group of developers. Different forms of ”virtual ethnography” have been developed as a way to observe internet based cultures (e.g. [29, 33, 43] ). Regardless of how well the field work is planned and prepared, even in smaller projects, the ethnographer will not be able to observe all relevant activities that are going on. Observations might need to be complemented with other data collection methods, like informal, in situ interviews, semi structured more formal interviews, or group interviews, e.g. in the form of a project retrospective.\
3.5 Theoretical underpinningEthnography often is seen as a bottom-up research method where the development of themes and concepts is based on reflective and inductive analysis. Theories are then developed by comparing results of several ethnographic studies. In order to relate ethnographic studies with each other, the themes and concepts developed in earlier studies have to be connected to the field work and analysis of the later studies, and this can be done via theory. One example is the social theory of learning by Lave and Wenger [34]: comparing findings from widely varying studies led to the formulation of a set of related concepts, a theory. This theory can then be used either as a focus for the field work in new ethnographic studies exploring social learning in different contexts, or to discuss the analysis of field material when peer learning emerges in the reflective and inductive analysis. Theories can be seen as tools to think with rather than a claim for quantifiable correlations that are or can be supported by experiments. For example, the social theory of learning talks about ‘communities of practice’ [34] as an important facilitator to develop and maintain expertise in professional environments. ‘Communities of practice’ as a phenomenon can be identified both through the way members refer to each other and how knowledge is shared with new colleagues and among established members. Using the concept, for example, to understand the onboarding of novices in a software engineering team, can help to structure and focus the observations in the field.A danger of using theory from the outset, though, is that the focus that a theory provides can become a bias in the empirical work. It can prevent the researcher from paying attention to aspects of the observed practices that do not fit the theory. To prevent theory-based biases, the same techniques used for other biases can be applied (see this chapter, section 4.2). Ethnography researches software development teams as sub-cultures or as social practices. Social theories that focus on social practices and how they reflexively constitute social structure therefore might fit well with the observations and findings and help to develop relevant insights. There are several such practice theories. For example, activity theory [19] focuses on how human goal-directed activity is mediated by tools and also by rules, distribution of labour, and community. Activity theory has for example been used to better understand tool support for distributed development [60]. Dittrich et al [16] and Dittrich [14], use Schatzki’s [50] concept of social practices and Knorr Cetina’s [7] concept of epistemic practices as inspiration to understand the evolution and design of software development practices. Here, the way members of a software team adopt and adapt methods is at the core of the research. Distributed cognition [31] emphasises the distributed nature of cognitive systems and focuses on collaborative work and the use of artefacts and representations. It results in an event-driven description which emphasises information and its propagation through the cognitive system under study. This has been used, for example, to understand how the structure of story cards and agile boards support collaboration [54] and how UX information is handled by agile development teams.The decision to consider theoretical frameworks can be taken based on the research intent, for example if the intent is to design and improve tools, the use of a theoretical framework that provides a vocabulary to identify and discuss the role of tools can be an advantage. As mentioned above, theory can also be used to interpret the data afterwards, e.g. Sharp et al. [56] used cognitive dimensions to analyse representations that were collected using distributed cognition as a framework. Giuffrida and Dittrich’s article [25] provides an example where ethnographic research is used to develop theory. They further develop concepts from coordination and communication theory to explain widely different success rates of student projects in distributed student projects. The initial analysis showed that successful projects used the Instant Messaging channel Skype provided to not only coordinate but also agree on coordination. In order to explain both what was going on and the differences, Genre theory and concepts based on articulation and coordination theory were combined and further developed.\

Although there is a wide variety of introductory books available, there has been no material targeting software engineering students particularly, until now. In this chapter we provide an introduction to teaching and learning ethnography for faculty teaching ethnography to software engineering graduate students and for the students themselves of such courses. The contents of the chapter focuses on what we think is the core basic knowledge for newbies to ethnography as a research method. We complement the text with proposals for exercises, tips for teaching, and pitfalls that we and our students have experienced. The chapter is designed to support part of a course on empirical software engineering and provides pointers and literature for further reading.Ethnographic studies are an important element of the toolbox for empirical software engineering as they can provide unique insights into software development practice [51]. Ethnography was originally developed as a method to understand foreign cultures by becoming embedded in them and documenting the learning and sensemaking that was experienced during the process [26]. Modern ethnography has been developed in an attempt to understand a foreign culture from a members’ perspective. With a growing interest in the understanding of subcultures close to the ethnographer, ethnographic research was used to learn more about a wide range of contexts including truck drivers [1], midwives [32], London underground workers [27] and organisational life [58, 64]. In the context of Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Supported Cooperative Work, ethnographic research was used to understand how the members of an organisation made use of technology. Examples for this kind of research include several studies of air traffic controllers in the context of a redesign of the system supporting their perception and control of air traffic [4], of copy machine repair personnel by Julian Orr [40], and of attorneys and paralegals to prepare the design of software supporting their document management [5]. For more than 25 years, ethnography has also been used in the context of software engineering research in order to study cooperative aspects of software engineering. Examples are a study on configuration management [28], a study on the use of social software in distributed software development [23, 24], and an ethnographic study of a small software house to investigate testing practices [39]. As in the original context, the benefit of ethnographic studies of software engineering is the understanding of how and why software teams do what they do to develop software. Ethnography allows understanding and describing collaboration in software engineering from the software engineers’ perspective. Ethnographic studies require the researcher to join a development team with the intent to understand the why and how of the team’s everyday practices.\

• It’s important for students to know the origins of ethnography but introduce the approach through a mixture of examples from software engineering and other disciplines so that the relevance to software engineering comes through• If you don’t have (much) experience of ethnography yourself then identify colleagues with experience to engage in your classes• It’s hard to see another person’s point of view, offer your students guidance on emotional intelligence, and how to see different perspectives• Present examples of existing ethnographies in software engineering for the students to facilitate their writing• Take an iterative approach to topics, e.g. provide some background, set an exercise, discuss the exercise and ask students to do the exercise again• Embrace the use of ethnography with other techniques, e.g. interviews, as these are often required in the field• Because activity in the field is fluid, ethical dimensions of the study need careful attention\
When we use the term ‘practices’ in this chapter, we talk about the established way a software team goes about developing and evolving software. Social practices, like cooperative software engineering, are based on an understanding of relevant objects, representations and tasks, on implicit and explicit rules, and on a common goal (for further readings see Section 7). Understanding software practices using an ethnographic approach aims to understand how and why the software development practices make sense from a members’ point of view, putting aside ideas on how to improve the observed practices for the time being. This can be hard for a software engineering researcher. As engineers and software engineering researchers we are trained to design and create things and to improve the methods used to this end. We tend to focus on problems and shortcomings, rather than aiming to understand how a complex activity such as software development actually takes place, or what enables a team to produce software at all. Ethnographic research invites us to temporarily put aside or ‘bracket’ [22] our assumptions of how software development should take place, and try to understand how developers make things work no matter what.\
In return, the results of ethnographic research help us understand the rationale behind even seemingly disadvantageous behaviour, which in turn provides us with important information when designing tools and methods. An example can be found in [61, 62]. The article presents an interview study triangulating an ethnographic study of software architecture practices for a software product. The researchers were surprised at the lack of any software architecture documentation and the unwillingness of the team to produce and maintain such documentation. A triangulating interview study revealed that this reluctance towards software architecture was shared by architects and tech leads of other products. The only exception, an open source project, also provided us with a rationale for this attitude: the existence of architecture documentation can prohibit discussion between the architects and the developers with the effect that the architects might not know how the developers change the architecture or where the architecture creates problems for the development and might need to be revised. This, in turn, means that tools for designing and communicating software architecture should be designed to support architect-developer discussions and not replace them. Had we not taken the reservations of the developers and architects seriously, we would not have understood that there was a ‘good reason for bad architecture documentation.\
Ethnographic studies can also lay the groundwork for practitioner support tools that are accepted by the community because they are based on an understanding of practitioners’ point of view. An example of this is the motivating jenny project which ran a multi-site ethnographic study to understand developers’ security behaviour. This project resulted in a number of insights including a model of security behaviour [35] that underpins a set of four practitioner packs designed to improve the security culture in a team or organisation (downloadable from motivatingjenny.org). These have been downloaded thousands of times and have been used in education and in industrial settingsOur previous, more theoretical and programmatic article in Transactions on Software Engineering [51] provides examples from empirical software engineer- ing where ethnography has been used. This chapter complements that article with support on how to implement and teach ethnographic research in a Software Engineering context. The goal of this chapter is twofold. On the one hand, we introduce ethnography as a research method for software engineering with a hands-on approach. We aim to provide concrete how-to support for researchers starting to use ethnography. Our intended reader in connection to this goal is a researcher, e.g. a PhD student, who wants to explore ethnography as a possible research method. On the other hand, we provide guidance for teachers of a postgraduate course on empirical research in software engineering. The chapter comprises what we see as the minimum contents of a module on ethnography as an empirical method for software engineering.\
In our tutorials, people have often asked us what is the difference between ethnography and other qualitative methods, such as contextual inquiry and grounded theory. And why not just do interviews? A simple response to these questions might include that contextual inquiry is based on an apprenticeship model, grounded theory seeks concepts in the domain that can be developed into a theory, and in interviews participants’ accounts will necessarily be partial and rationalised. Ethnographic research, on the other hand, focuses on a holistic view of the practice being studied, has research questions that evolve over the course of the study, and aims to capture activity as it happens together with practitioners’ rationale. But there is more to it than this. This chapter will provide a deeper answer to these questions. The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses whether ethnography is the right choice from three perspectives: the role of ethnographic studies in relation to your specific research context; the type of research question it can address; and what is required of the researcher. Section 3 discusses the planning of an ethnographic study. Section 4 covers important topics such as field work and addresses issues ranging from the role the researchers take on in relation to the team, to how to design and keep a field diary. Section 5 introduces the analysis of ethnographic data and section 6 covers research ethics for ethnography. Section 7 concludes the chapter and provides suggestions for further reading.\

This dual-sided platform pays creators for developing the personalities of the AI agents that assist with making healthy online connections, democratizing AI development while encouraging better social interactions.The YapWorld platform provides all the tools required for creators to develop customized AI companions, known as Yaps (Your Agentic Pal). Yaps represent a wide range of personalities, including historical figures, fictional characters, even subject-matter experts, all trained on easily-accessed data such as online video and text.Once created, Yaps are activated with the platform’s currency, $SHRD, bringing these creations to life by tokenizing them. This step renders Yaps eligible for earning through online interactions. Tokenized Yaps meeting engagement milestones (10k messages, for example) are eligible to receive a share of a 40% Creator Profit Pool funded through the platform’s net subscription revenue. Key to unlocking the ability to monetize creator contributions, YapWorld introduces the concept of “Monetizable Talk Time (MTT),” a measure of interaction similar in principle to video platforms’ “watch time.” Through quantifying active engagement between users and AI agents, MTT establishes a standard mechanism for rewarding creators driving the adoption of Social AI.With YapWorld, Andrometa defines new possibilities for social connection by building the Social AI creator economy, rewarding participants for initiating and developing relationships online, leading to lasting real-world friendships. This integration of specific AI tools with a reward system designed to motivate their healthy use embodies Andrometa’s mission to make social media social again. is on a mission to “make social media social again.” Fusing Social AI with engaging gaming experiences and a powerful creator economy, Andrometa is building an interconnected ecosystem designed to facilitate genuine human connection. Its flagship platform, YapWorld, empowers creators to build and earn from their personal AI companions. is the first Social AI platform built on a “Creator as Partner” philosophy, the flagship application of the Andrometa ecosystem in which users can create, train, and earn money from their Yaps (Your Agentic Pal). YapWorld is designed as a true partnership, sharing 40% of its subscription profits with the creators who build the most engaging companions. The $SHRD token is the key used to officially enter a Yap into this creator economy, unlocking its potential to earn.Strategy & Implementation by Andrometa PR.:::tip

Inspired by our retro aesthetic, these icons encapsulate the internet’s golden era.Since launch, the library has reached:\
The incredible response from our community – from solo developers to design agencies – showed us that our icons were solving real problems. And your feedback pushed us to take things to the next level…Great news: our free, attribution-required license isn't going anywhere! But we heard from many of you who wanted the option to use our icons without attribution or needed clearer commercial licensing for client work.So today, we're launching two new paid plans alongside our existing free option:: Same as always, unlimited use with attribution (NEW): No attribution required, perfect for one project (NEW): No attribution required, unlimited projects No attribution required for paid plans, plus crystal-clear commercial licensing terms for professional use.\
Let's break down each plan.Use icons in unlimited projects (with attribution)Use for commercial purposes (with attribution)Modify, recolor, and adapt icons to match your designShare and distribute as part of your end product\
Under the following terms:Attribution is required - you must credit Pixel Icon Library and HackerNoonYou cannot claim ownership or authorship of the iconsYou cannot resell or redistribute icons as a standalone productUse icons in one product or project (includes all related materials such as a website, app, packaging, or printed merchandise)Use for personal or commercial purposesModify, recolor, or adapt icons to match your project's design languageUse in both digital and physical formats as part of the same end product\
Under the following terms:Cannot use the icons in more than one project, product, or client engagementCannot redistribute, resell, sublicense, or share the icons in their original or modified formCannot include the icons in a publicly accessible asset library, theme, UI kit, or similar productCannot claim ownership, authorship, or trademark rights over the icons or derivative versionsLicense is granted to a single individual and is non-transferable - each additional user, freelancer, or contractor must obtain their own licenseUse icons in unlimited end products, projects, or client worksUse for internal or commercial purposes across multiple projectsIncorporate into design systems, websites, digital products, and printed materialsModify, recolor, or adapt icons for any project\
Under the following terms:Cannot resell, sublicense, distribute, or make the icons available as a standalone product or assetCannot include the icons in open-source repositories, downloadable template packs, or redistributable UI kitsCannot allow external contractors or unaffiliated entities to access or use the icons under this licenseCannot claim ownership of the icons or derivative versions thereof\
Note for agencies and teams: Studios, agencies, and teams may use the icons across multiple projects, clients, and deliverables created by their own staff. Clients do not need their own license if the icons are part of a completed project delivered by you. Separate licenses are required only if a client, contractor, or external partner intends to use, modify, or redistribute the icons independently.Our in-house designer, , documented the process in two in-depth articles:What's the difference between the Free, Starter, and Pro plans?The Free plan (CC BY 4.0) lets you use the icons anywhere - personal or commercial - but you must give credit. The Starter plan removes attribution and covers one project or product. The Pro plan removes attribution too but lets you use the icons across multiple projects or clients.\
Do I have to pay again for future updates?Nope. All paid plans are one-time purchases with lifetime access. You'll get any future icon updates automatically.\
Can I use the free icons in commercial work?Yes, you can. For Free Plan, just make sure to credit Pixel Icon Library somewhere visible (for example, in your site footer).\
If I buy the Starter plan, can I use it for multiple projects or clients?No. The Starter License is for one project, product, or client only. If you want to use the icons in another project or for another client, you'll need another Starter License or better yet upgrade to Pro.\
What if I'm a freelancer working with different clients?Go for the Pro License - it covers all your client work without needing to buy separate licenses each time.\
Can I use the icons in a paid template, theme, or asset pack I'm selling?No, none of the licenses allow redistribution or resale of the icons (even if modified). They must be used within your own or your client's end product.\
Can I edit or recolor the icons?Absolutely. You can tweak, recolor, and adapt them however you like for your project - just don't redistribute the icons as your own library.\
Can I use the icons in both a website and an app?Yes - if they're part of the same project, that's totally fine under Starter. If they're different projects or brands, you'll need Pro.\
Do I get a license document or receipt?Yes - after purchase, you'll get a receipt and a downloadable text license file for your records.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why have there been so many school kidnappings in Nigeria recently? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vd4sG-Qai8</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1vd4sG-Qai8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 16:18:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Christian group in Nigeria has announced that around 50 of the more than 300 children who were kidnapped from a Catholic school last week have escaped.

And I see a stack of alerts from the last hour of packages showing signs of malware in our triage queue. Having not yet finished my first cup of coffee, I see Shai Hulud indicators. Yikes, surely that's a false positive? Nope, welcome to Monday, Shai Hulud struck again. Strap in.Timeline of the Shai-Hulud CampaignThe timing is notable, given npm’s recent announcement that it will revoke classic tokens on December 9 after the wave of supply-chain attacks. With many users still not migrated to trusted publishing, the attacker seized the moment for one more hit before npm’s deadline.August 27 - We release our report detailing the S1ngularity campaign targeting several nx packages on npm.  September 18 - We publish a follow-up analysis, diving deeper into the campaign’s technical quirks and early payload behavior.  November 24 - A second strike occurs, dubbed the “Second Coming” by the attackers, timed just before npm’s deadline for revoking old tokens.What is Shai-Hulud?: A Quick Refresher Shai-Hulud, named after the gigantic sandworms from Dune as part of the attacker's flair for theatrics, is a self-replicating npm worm built to spread quickly through compromised developer environments. Once it infects a system, it searches for exposed secrets such as API keys and tokens using TruffleHog and publishes anything it finds to a public GitHub repository. It then attempts to push new copies of itself to npm, helping it propagate across the ecosystem, while exfiltrating data back to the attacker. Keeping with the dramatic theme, the attacker refers to this latest wave as the “Second Coming.”Differences from last timeThis time around, there are some significant differences in the attack:It install bun with the file  and then uses that to execute   which is the actual malicious code.It creates a randomly named repository with stolen data, rather than a hardcoded name.It will infect up to 100 npm packages, compared to 20 last time.If it can't authenticate with GitHub or NPM, it will wipe all files in the users Home directory.This time, the malware also publishes secrets to GitHub, with a random name and the repository description:"Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming."Currently we see 26.3k repositories exposed:As we've been analzying all these packages, we've noticed a number of compromised packages that appear to be from community spread, which contain the initial staging code in , but NOT  which is the Shai Hulud worm itself. Here's the code that spreads the worm into other packages:      }
    }
  }We see that the  may sometimes not be bundled, depending on different factors. It appears that mistakes were once again made by the attackers. This appears to have limited the imapct of the attack at this time. Compromised GitHub repositoriesThe AsyncAPI team detected that there had been a branch of their CLI project, which was created just prior to the malicious packages being pushed, which deployed a version of the Shai Hulud malware. Companies acknowlege incidentGiven the nature of the incident, we were very happy to see companies quickly acknowledge what happened, in posts from these companies:We detected the first packages starting at 11/24/2025 3:16:26 AM GMT+0, which were the packages go-template, and 36 packages from . Many more packages were quickly compromised. Afterwards, they started compromising PostHog packages at 11/24/2025  4:11:55 AM GMT+0, and Postman packages at 11/24/2025  5:09:25 AM GMT+0.‍Which packages are affected?We've detected the following packages compromised with a new version of Shai Hulud.

impact of Shai-Hulud: Second ComingThreat actors have slipped malicious code into hundreds of NPM packages — including major ones from Zapier, ENS, AsyncAPI, PostHog, Browserbase, and Postman. If a developer installs one of these bad packages, the malware quietly runs , before anything even finishes installing. This gives it access to the developer’s machine, build systems, or cloud environment. It then uses an automated tool (TruffleHog) to search for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, cloud tokens, and GitHub or NPM credentials. Anything it finds is uploaded to a public GitHub repository labeled “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.” If those stolen secrets include access to code repositories or package registries, attackers can use them to break into more accounts and publish more malicious packages, helping the attack spread further. Because trusted ecosystems were involved and millions of downloads are affected, any team using NPM should immediately check whether they were impacted and rotate any credentials that may have leaked.‍Which actions should security teams take?Audit all Zapier/ENS-related npm dependencies and versions.Rotate  GitHub, npm, cloud, and CI/CD secrets used during installs.Check GitHub for strange repos with the description  “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming”Disable npm  scripts in CI where possible.Pin package versions and enforce MFA on GitHub and npm accounts.Use tools like Safe-Chain to block malicious packages on NPM ‍Story developing...

Engineering teams are currently combing through Apple's operating systems to eliminate unnecessary code and address quality issues that users have reported since iOS 26's September release. Those complaints include device overheating, unexplained battery drain, user interface glitches, keyboard failures, cellular connectivity problems, app crashes, and sluggish animations. 

iOS 27 won't be feature-free. Apple plans several AI additions: a health-focused AI agent tied to a Health+ subscription, expanded AI-powered web search meant to compete with ChatGPT and Perplexity, and deeper AI integration across apps. The company has also been internally testing a chatbot app called Veritas as a proving ground for its re-architected Siri, though a standalone chatbot product isn't currently planned.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Former MrBeast content strategist is building an AI tool for creator ideation and analytics</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/former-mrbeast-content-strategist-is-building-an-ai-tool-for-creator-ideation-and-analytics/</link><author>Ivan Mehta</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 15:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Palo is a tool for short-video creators to gain insights into what is working for them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Ameen Shahid Is Transforming Quality Engineering Into a Strategic Powerhouse</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-ameen-shahid-is-transforming-quality-engineering-into-a-strategic-powerhouse?source=rss</link><author>Jon Stojan Journalist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 15:14:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Director Ameen Shahid transforms Quality Engineering into a strategic engine for global supply chain excellence.

Two of these people are civilians; one is a “vulnerable,” someone being pursued and targeted by government agents. They talk in hushed tones to one another, playing music to keep fear at bay. Above the door of the courthouse, a plaque reads, “Liberty and Justice for Most.”At the bottom of the courthouse stairs, two government agents step out of a purple golf cart. They approach the door. They’re carrying guns. “Hey, is anyone inside?” one of them says. “Any vulnerables in here? We have a warrant. We have a warrant for any vulnerables in the area.” One civilian opens the door, sees the agents, and immediately slams it shut. After more warrant calls, the civilian says, “Slip it under the door.”“I would slip it under the door, but there’s no space under the door,” the agent says, stuttering. The civilian pauses. “Well.

[...] Aaron Levie, chief executive of the cloud content management company Box, got early access to Gemini 3 several days ahead of the launch. The company ran its own evaluations of the model over the weekend to see how well it could analyze large sets of complex documents. "At first we kind of had to squint and be like, 'OK, did we do something wrong in our eval?' because the jump was so big," he said. "But every time we tested it, it came out double-digit points ahead." 

[...] Google has been scrambling to get an edge in the AI race since the launch of ChatGPT three years ago, which stoked fears among investors that the company's iconic search engine would lose significant traffic to chatbots. The company struggled for months to get traction. Chief Executive Sundar Pichai and other executives have since worked to overhaul the company's AI development strategy by breaking down internal silos, streamlining leadership and consolidating work on its models, employees say. Sergey Brin, one of Google's co-founders, resumed a day-to-day role at the company helping to oversee its AI-development efforts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Momentic raises $15M to automate software testing</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/momentic-raises-15m-to-automate-software-testing/</link><author>Russell Brandom</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:00:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI testing startup Momentic has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures.

By plugging in a retrieval pipeline, you could feed models fresh documents and get more accurate answers.\
But as real-world use cases grew—legal reasoning, biomedical analysis, financial modelling—:It struggles with ambiguity.It loses context when knowledge spans multiple chunks.It can’t reason across documents.It can’t adapt to complex tasks or evolving queries.\
Enter —a family of architectures designed to fix these weaknesses. Today, we explore the three most influential ones: , , and .GraphRAG integrates a  directly into the retrieval and generation flow. Instead of treating text as isolated chunks, it treats the world as a web of entities and relationships.Many questions require multi-hop reasoning:“Which treatments link symptom A to condition C?”“How does regulation X indirectly impact sector Y?”“What theme connects these three research papers?”Traditional RAG flattens all this into embeddings. GraphRAG preserves structure.How GraphRAG Works (In Plain English)Retrieve candidate documents.   Standard vector search pulls the initial context.Extract entities and build/expand a graph. Each node = concept, entity, or document snippet. Each edge = semantic relationship inferred from text.Run graph-based retrieval. The system “walks” the graph to find related concepts, not just related chunks.Feed structured graph context into the LLM.\
The result? Answers that understand , not just co-occurrence.Biomedical decision supportLegal clause interpretationMulti-document academic synthesisAny task needing multi-hop reasoningLightRAG is a leaner, faster, and cheaper alternative to heavyweight graph-based systems like GraphRAG. It keeps the good parts (graph indexing) but removes the expensive parts (full graph regeneration, heavy agent workflows).Most businesses don’t have:multi-GPU inference clustersthe patience to rebuild massive graphs after every data update\
LightRAG’s core mission: high-quality retrieval on small hardware.1. Graph-Based Indexing (But Lighter)It builds a graph over your corpus—but in an incremental way. Add 100 documents? Only update 100 nodes, not the entire graph.: find fine-grained details: find big-picture themes\
This dual-layer design massively improves contextual completeness.Optimized for smaller models such as 7B–32B deployments.Real-time chat assistantsMedium-sized enterprise deployments with limited GPU allocationKey advantage over GraphRAGNo need for full graph reconstructionToken cost up to 1/6000 of GraphRAG (based on Microsoft benchmarks)AgenticRAG is the most ambitious of the three. Instead of a fixed pipeline, it uses autonomous agents that plan, retrieve, evaluate, and retry.\
Think of it as RAG with:Real-world queries rarely fit a single-step workflow.“Summarize the last 3 fiscal quarters and compare competitive landscape impacts.”“Design a migration plan for a multi-cloud payment architecture.”“Analyze the latest regulations and produce compliance recommendations.”\
These require multiple queries, multiple tools, and multi-step reasoning.\
AgenticRAG handles all of this automatically.1. The agent analyzes the query.If the question is complex, it creates a multi-step plan.Could be vector search, graph search, web search, or structured database queries.3. It retrieves, checks, and iterates.If the results are incomplete, it revises the strategy.This is the closest we currently have to autonomous reasoning over knowledge.Customer agents with multi-step workflowsAny domain requiring dynamic adaptation| Feature | GraphRAG | LightRAG | AgenticRAG |
|----|----|----|----|
|  | Knowledge graph reasoning | Lightweight graph + dual retrieval | Autonomous planning & iterative retrieval |
|  | Multi-hop reasoning | Efficiency & speed | Dynamic adaptability |
|  | High | Low | Medium–High |
|  | Legal, medical, and scientific tasks | Edge/low-resource deployments | Complex multi-step tasks |
|  | Full graph rebuild | Incremental updates | Depends on workflow |
|  | Bigger is better | Runs well on smaller models | Medium to large |Choose GraphRAG if you need:✔ Deep reasoning   ✔ Entity-level understanding   ✔ Multi-hop knowledge traversalChoose LightRAG if you need:✔ Fast inference   ✔ Local/edge deployment   ✔ Low-cost retrievalChoose AgenticRAG if you need:✔ Multi-step planning   ✔ Tool orchestration   ✔ Dynamic decision makingTraditional RAG was a breakthrough, but it wasn’t the end of the story. GraphRAG, LightRAG, and AgenticRAG each push RAG closer toward , scalable real-world deployment, and .\

Reliably play midi music files from a  folder or ".m3u"  play list. Adjust playback speed, volume and output device on-the-fly during playback. A large playback progress bar makes jumping forward and backward in time a breeze with just a single click or tap. Supports ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi" files in format 0 (single track) and format 1 (multi-track). Comes complete with 25 sample midis ready to play.Cynthia playing through her sample midi musicDesktop App (Standard Edition)4th Generation (Gossamer for GUI)Windows All and Wine for Linux and MacSHA256 Checksum8B9CAB404E174767144C13A32C7357FDF320EA6D632069E68AFC10F107F98F38Cynthia playing through her sample midi musicCynthia displaying her menuRealtime display panels Visual (Tracks, Channels, and Notes), Piano and Bars visibleCynthia in her traditional view - Navigation, Information and Settings panels visibleEasily adjust channel volumes on-the-fly with the integrated mixer - hover over/tap the Channels panel to show/editCynthia in the "Deep Orange 2" color scheme (Options > Color) and "Swell" animated background scheme (Options > Background), with Compact mode on (Options > Settings > Compact)Several sample midis built-in.  When starting Cynthia for the first time, these sample midis are listed in the " Play Folder" panel, and playback is automatic.
At any point during playback, you may select another midi from the list.  Playback seamlessly switches to the selected midi in question.
Cynthia supports realtime changes to settings during playback.  This means you may adjust the Playback Mode, Playback Device, Volume and Speed without having to stop/restart playback.⏶The main toolbar is located near the top of Cynthia's window.  From left to right, it has the links of: Nav - Toggle display of navigation panel Play Folder - Show the "Play Folder" panel to play midis from a folder Play List - Show the "Play List" panel to play midis from a playlist Prev - Play previous midi file in list Rewind - Shift playback position back several seconds Stop - Stop playback Play - Toggle playback: When playing ( flashing) playback stops/when stopped ( static) playback starts Fast Forward - Shift playback position forward several seconds Next - Play next midi file in list Menu - Show menu Mixer - Show the Windows Mixer app Options - Show the Options window, to change Cynthia's appearance Help - Show (from rightmost column) or hide built-in help⏶From the main toolbar click " Play Folder" link (top left) to display the "Play Folder" panel. Play Folder, there is no need for a playlist or setup.  Just navigate to the folder in question and instantly play the midis within.   Home" entry at top of list (scroll up if not visible).  The list will refresh with the names of your hard drives, pen sticks and other local storage devices.  Double click a drive, then the subsequent folder(s) to the one that you want to play.
The list will update.  Double click a specific midi to begin playback, or, click the " Play" link. Refresh - Refresh the playback list Fav - Show the "Favourites" window.  Use this handy window to maintain a list of your favourite folders for quick access. Back - Go to the previous folder in navigation history Forward - Go to the next folder in navigation history:There is no need to stop playback before switching to another folder.  Double click the new folder and wait several seconds for Cynthia to automatically recommence playback.
The current folder will be remembered when Cynthia is restarted.⏶The standard ".m3u" playlist format is supported.  This is a plain text file that contains the length of the midi in seconds, a title, and the location of each midi.
Cynthia supports midi playback from local storage devices, such as hard disks, pen sticks etc.  Internet urls are not supported.
If you already have a playlist in the m3u format saved on your disk, you can open it in Cynthia for playback.  From the main toolbar click the " Play List" link (top left) to show the Play List panel.  An additional toolbar presents.  Click the " Open" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Open".  From the Open window, navigate to your playlist, select and click the "Open" button.
The contents of your playlist will load inside the  Play List panel.  Click the " Play" link to begin playback.⏶There are several ways a playlist can be constructed.  The first method is the easiest.  From your computer explorer ("File Explorer" in Windows and "Files" in Ubuntu) navigate to the folder of midis.  Highlight one or more midis files inside the folder and drag the selection onto Cynthia and let go of the mouse button.  The " Play List" panel updates and displays the dropped midi files appended, to the list.  Repeat this process for as many midi files as required.
At anytime you may save the playlist.  From the Play List toolbar, click the " Save As" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Save As...".  Type a name in the Save window and click the "Save" button to save the playlist.
It is worth noting that each time Cynthia saves your playlist to file, the midi files referenced inside it have their names adjusted automatically to work with the specific save location of the playlist.
Most midi filenames in a playlist are relative, as they do not have the full drive, folder and filename, but rather a partial folder structure and the midi's name.  This is to permit the movement of the midis and the playlist from one location to another without the need for the playlist to be specifically rewritten.
If you are curious at what the playlist format looks like, click the " Copy All" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Copy All" to copy the entire playlist to Clipboard.  Note Cynthia will use a full filename for each listed midi file, since the Clipboard cannot be referenced from a disk location.  You may paste it into any text editor to view, modify, or rearrange the order of the midi files listed.
To paste an altered playlist back into Cynthia, click the " Replace" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Replace".  The Play List panel will update.
Cynthia has support for extended playlists.  Note!  A large playlist of 100,000+ midi files will use about 102MB of RAM and require a second or two to apply midi filename adjustments.
Support for playlist filtering is provided.  An example:  You may instruct Cynthia to list only ".mid" files by deselecting ".midi" and ".rmi" options from the "File Types" option panel (right column).  The playlist itself remains unchanged - how Cynthia uses it changes.  Edit - Show edit menu New - Prompt to clear playlist Open - Open a playlist from file Save As - Save playlist to file Cut - Cut selected playlist item to Clipboard Copy - Copy selected playlist item to Clipboard Copy All - Copy entire playlist to Clipboard Paste - Add Clipboard playlist to end of current playlist Replace - Replace current playlist with Clipboard playlist Undo - Undo last change to playlist:
The current playlist is remembered for next time Cynthia is started.
To show or hide the above toolbar links, tick or untick the " Edit > Show Links on Toolbar" option.  Unticking the option hides all links except " Edit" and " Paste".⏶If you're a lover of simplicity itself, wishing only to play midi files directly from your hard drive folders as is, or, you're a playlist fan, rest assured, switching between these two very different playback systems, is as easy as a single click on either the " Play Folder" or " Play List" links.
Whilst the Play Folder method is limited to playing only the files contained in the currently selected folder, there is zero setup, no list to be built, and playback can start without hassle.
The Play List method on the other hand allows for a far more in depth custom playback experience.  It supports the playback of midis across multiple disk drives, folders and in any assembled order.
Additionally, Cynthia's large capacity list can easily handle a very large playlist.  For example a playlist of 10,000+ midis is just fine.
And switching between these two playback methods can be done during playback without issue.:
The playback options File Types, Playback Mode, Playback Device, Speed and Volume are shared between both playback systems, and do not change or require adjustment after a switch.⏶Located bottom of left column.
Playback mode (bottom left) determines how Cynthia plays the list of midis in the Play Folder or Play List panel (left column).Play currently selected midi to the end, and stop playback.
Repeat the currently selected midi without stopping playback.
Play each midi in turn, working down the list (left column), then restart from the top.  Playback initially starts at currently selected midi.
Each midi in the list is played working downward through the list.  Playback stops at the end of the last midi.
Continuously play a midi, selecting each new one randomly from the list.⏶Located towards bottom of right column.There are three midi file types supported: ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi".  The first two are identical file formats, only the file extension differs.  The third format, ".rmi", is slightly different and contains additional multimedia information for Microsoft Windows.
By default all three file types are selected (lit black).  In this state, all playable midi files are listed in the Play Folder and Play List panels.
To restrict the file types to be played back, click the file type to deselect it.  The list of midis (left column) updates to reflect the change.
If all three options are deselected, Cynthia interprets this as if all three were selected.⏶Located towards bottom of right column.
By default all midi playback is sent to the Windows Midi Mapper system - the default Windows midi note handler.
If you have more than one midi device installed on your computer, Cynthia can redirect the midi notes to that device instead.
Traditionally, a midi device had been considered to be hardware.  But now, with the advent of powerful computer hardware, software can now act as virtual hardware, allowing for advanced features to be included on your computer without the need for hardware upgrades or physical adjustment.
A midi software driver can support a soundfont, which can greatly enhances the playback quality of a midi through it's support for large, high-quality, instrumental sound libraries.
To change the playback device, select a number in the playback device control (bottom right).  Up to ten devices (1-10) is supported.  "Map" is the Windows Midi Mapper.  Selecting a dash will cause playback to stop producing audible sound (no device selected for sound output).  In this case, the last usable (numbered) midi device will be automatically selected after a short time delay, recommencing audible playback without the need for user input.
Cynthia supports realtime device switching during playback.  A small, momentary interruption to playback may occur during a device change.  The name of the device in use by Cynthia is listed in the playback device control (bottom right), for example as "Playback Device: Midi Mapper".  In later versions of Microsoft Windows the Midi Mapper was discontinued - in this case, Cynthia uses the first installed midi device. 
It is worth noting that using another device may require a separate adjustment to that device's volume control, some devices do, and some do not.  If it does have a volume control, it is more than likely to be accessible via Windows "Volume Mixer" application.  Click the " Mixer" link from the top toolbar to display the application and adjust the volume control of your device accordingly.⏶Located towards bottom of right column.
By default, Cynthia plays back a midi at normal speed (100%).  Drag the slider to the right to increase the playback speed up to a maximum speed of 1,000% or 10x normal speed.
To slow down playback speed, drag the slider to the left.  A value less than 100% slows playback to less than normal speed.  The slider can go as low as 10% or 1/10th normal playback speed.
Playback speed may be adjusted at any point during playback.  All changes take place in realtime.  An auto-fade in feature momentarily quietens playback to avoid any sudden or unexpected notes.⏶Located at bottom of right column.
For maximum compatibility between different operating systems and device types (hardware and software) and their capabilities, Cynthia employs a multi-layer volume control system which adjusts both hardware and midi note volumes.
To adjust playback volume, position the slider to the right to increase the volume and to the left to decrease it.
An increase above 100% boosts the midi volume, making low-level, hard to hear midis, more discernable.⏶Adjust playback position with a single click or tap.  Additionally, hovering a mouse cursor over the Playback Progress bar displays a vertical marker for the new playback time and position.  Click to apply new position.  The midi playback will shift to a new position and automatic fade in eases back playback volume to avoid sudden clicks, pops or abrupt notes.
Use keyboard arrow keys to progressively move forward or backward through the midi.  A vertical marker will display.
Not currently playing?  Click in the Playback Progress bar to commence playback at that position.⏶Synchronised lyric display is supported for midis with lyrics.
To enable lyrics, from the main toolbar click the " Menu" link and tick "Show Lyrics".
When included within a midi, lyrics are displayed inside the Playback Progress bar (bottom of Cynthia) as "Playback Progress - Lyrics:" with several words or part words visible at any one time.
A midi without lyrics will display "Playback Progress".
If hyphenated lyrics are required in order to highlight the pauses between part-words, from main toolbar click the " Menu" link and tick "Hyphenate Lyrics".⏶Sometimes there can be a short, noticeable playback delay when commencing playback, initially.  This delay is preparation time for Cynthia to ready playback.
There is no delay switching between midis during playback as Cynthia remains connected to the midi device.  By default, after a short period of no playback (5 seconds or more), the midi device will switch to offline, and a short delay will occur when playback is next started.
To avoid this delay, the "Always on Midi" option may be used to keep a midi device online, even when Cynthia is not playing.  From the main toolbar click the " Menu" option and tick the "Always on Midi" option.:
You can always tell if the midi device is online or not - from the "Midi Information" panel on the right.  Look for the item called "Device" in the "Technical list".  This will either be "Online" or "Offline".⏶Midis comes in various format types.  The simplest is format 0, a single track format, that stores all it's tempo (speed), notes and commands on a single, mixed track.
A format 1 midi, on the other hand, uses a dedicated master track (first track) to store all of it's tempo (speed) commands for the entire midi.  Notes and commands are stored separately on additional, multiple tracks.
Cynthia supports both format 0 and format 1 midis with file extension ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi".
A third, format 2 midi exists.  This format type is not supported by Cynthia.  In addition, Cynthia does not support system exclusive messages.  These messages will be ignored, and typically relate to manufacturer specific equipment.⏶Cynthia must be setup to use an Xbox Controller.  From the top toolbar select "Menu > Xbox Controller" and select the "Active Only" or "Active and Inactive" option.  Pair an Xbox Controller to your computer (if not already done).  Cynthia automatically detects and uses active Xbox Controllers.  More than one controller can be used at the same time.1.

The "Color Schemes" list is split into three sections:
1. Built-In color schemes - read only/use as is
2. Custom color schemes - user customisable and labelled Custom 1-10
3. Saved color schemes - user customisable and saved as file(s) on disk
There are 160+ built-in color schemes to choose from.  Simply select a color scheme to apply in realtime.  For instance, Aqua Marine.  Watch as the app's GUI changes color instantly - no need for an additional load, apply, or set.
A Blaiz Enterprises' color scheme (*.bcs) at its core is a list of twenty colors, responsible for coloring most aspects of the app's GUI.  Some specialised colors are derived automatically from these.  Two colors for the frame, nine for important areas, Title colors, and nine more for common zones, Standard colors.
Each built-in color scheme has it's own unique set of colors.  A custom color scheme allows for colors to be customised.  To create a custom color scheme, scroll down the list to the section titled "Custom".  He you'll find ten custom color scheme slots - each fully customisable in realtime without any need to be named, saved or applied.  Tap or click on a slot to start - for example slot 1 - "Custom 1".
On the right a series of editable color palettes will appear.  Click a palette to display the color dialog window.  Adjust color as desired and click OK when done.  Alternatively, click and drag your mouse cursor/fingertip from the color palette to acquire color from your computer screen in realtime.  App GUI continuously updates to reflect changes in color.  All changes are automatically saved.⏶Want your shiny new color scheme to have its own name?  Easy.  From the color schemes list - click "Options > Color" to display dialog - scroll down to the "Custom" section, select your custom color scheme, and click " Menu >  Save As...".  Type a name and click the "Save" button.  Your color scheme is saved to disk and listed under the "Saved" section of the color schemes list - next section down.
Any color scheme can be saved to disk, and then edited.  For instance, you can select one of the built-in color schemes, such as Aqua Marine, and save it to disk, then customise as desired.⏶Click "Options > Color" to show the color schemes list.  Scroll down to the last section named "Saved".  This section presents a list of all your saved color schemes in one central location.  Select a scheme to use.⏶Yes.  Any saved color scheme can be customised without fuss.  Click "Options > Color" and scroll down to the section named "Saved", click the color scheme you wish to edit, and adjust the color(s) as desired.  All changes are saved automatically back to the file on disk, without any need to explicitly save.⏶A background scheme is a static or animated image tiled across the background layer of the app.  The app's GUI components sit above this layer/merge into it, such as toolbars, tool images, buttons, text etc.  There are 60 built-in background schemes, based on several images with different presets, like horizontal and vertical scroll speeds, fade in and out rates, and wobble levels.  These functions allow for a static image to give movement to the app.  While some background schemes are specially set for animation, others are not.
The background image can be rendered in full color, or shade-shifted toward greyscale, or shade-shifted toward the app's current highlight color.  One slider, Colorise, controls this tri-function.
A background scheme supports a maximum image color depth of 32 bits in RGBA format - 8 bit red, green, blue, and alpha channels - for instance a transparent PNG image.:
An animated background scheme can operate at frame rates of up to 20 fps (frames per second), which means the entire GUI of the app is repainted in full, 20 times per second, like a video, and therefore can consume quite a bit of CPU power, especially at high resolutions.  It is recommended a modern, powerful machine be used for high frame rates/resolutions in order to maintain smooth operation of the GUI.:
Determines how much of the background image is seen/made visible.  A low value renders the background subtly beneath the GUI, whereas a high value, 100-255, renders it boldly.  A value above 100 is disabled by default.  To enable, click "Options > Settings" and deselect "Display > Safe Background".  A value over 100 may overpower the GUI making it hard to navigate or operate.  If this becomes the case, press the "F2" key, and then the Enter key to confirm restoration of the app's default settings.
Set the color rendering method.  A value of 100 renders the background image in full color, a value of 0 in greyscale, and a value of -100 in the app's current highlight color.
Paint speed in frames per second.  0 is static - the background scheme only repaints when required.  This is the least stressful option.  A value of 1-20 sets a constant repaint cycle of 1-20 fps (frames per second).
Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll (-100..100):
Moves background image left/up (minus value) or right/down (plus value) by X pixels.  A value of zero turns movement off.
Horizontal Wobble/Vertical Wobble (0..300):
Applies a wobble factor to the above Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll movement(s).
Cycles through a high-to-low-to-high intensity flow, gradually fading the background image from view, then back again, in a continuous cycle.  Use a low value for a slow cycle, and a high value for a fast cycle.  
Applies a wobble factor to the Fade In/Out flow cycle above.⏶Yes you can.  There are 10 custom background scheme slots.  Click "Options > Background" and scroll down to the section named "Custom".  For instance, click on "Custom 1".  A sub-toolbar will display in the right column at the top.  From there, you can paste in an image from Clipboard - click "Paste", or open an image from file - click "File".
For best visual results, your image should be a similar size to the app's overall area, and be prepped for tiling work - that is, have it's right and bottom edges modified so that its colors/pixels seamlessly wrap back round to its opposing edge (right-to-left and top-to-bottom).  You can use a tile creation app, or a good quality graphics app to accomplish this, or use our "Blend It" app to prep your image.
Without this, tiling the image may present abrupt edges of unwanted opposing lines of horizontal/vertical colors, and be visually jarring in nature.
Adjust the sliders as required to accomplish animation and visual effects.  All changes to the image and sliders are saved in realtime.⏶The frame on our apps have a long history reaching back to the late 1990s, where they first adorned our FastCards and PowerCards (still/animated electronic musical greeting cards).
In the context of an app, they primarily serve as a large, easy-grip area for resizing the app's overall size, and a touch of decoration to boot.
A frame can be made wide or narrow as required.  The modern app has a typical frame width of 7 px in a plain style, so as not to distract or occupy excessive screen real estate.
Furthermore, a frame may render with an optional, randomised sparkle effect, with a range of 0 (no sparkle) to 20 (heavy sparkle).
Click "Options > Frame" to edit the app's current frame settings.  A list of 50 built-in frames is available to choose from, ranging from Antique to Traditional 5.
Toward the bottom of the window are two sliders to adjust the frame's Sparkle (strength) and Size (width in pixels).  A frame can be sized from 0 px (no frame) up to a wide frame of 72 px.  All changes update in realtime.⏶Click "Options > Font" to display zoom and font specific settings.  By default, the app is set to automatic zoom, which means it will scale up its text and images if the monitor it's displayed on is above 2K in resolution.Why scale text and images at all?  What is special about 4K and 8K monitors?  At first glance it may not be obvious the significant difference between standard 2K resolution, and the much higher 4K and 8K resolutions.
But high resolution monitors, such as 4K and 8K displays have far more pixels (colored dots) per inch on screen than previous generations of monitors, that is, the screen size may be the same but more dots are packed into the same area.  Consequently, an app without scaling abilities may appear small or even blurred on these monitors.  That's because as new monitors and TVs gain ever greater resolutions, statically sized apps shrink in size/fail to compensate.  This is why a modern app must be able to scale up to match the appropriate resolution.
Here is a comparison of common display resolutions:
2K = 1920w x 1080h =  2,073,600 pixels
4K = 3840w x 2160h =  8,294,400 pixels
8K = 7680w x 4320h = 33,177,600 pixels
A 4K (ultra high definition) monitor uses four times (4x) more pixels than it's 2K (full high definition) counterpart.  A statically built app without scaling would shrink to 50% of it's size, making it difficult to use.  An operating system may attempt to counter this by scaling it up using pixel stretching - very much like zooming up a photo - unfortunately this tends to blur the appearance of the app.
The same app on an 8K monitor would suffer even greater shrinkage, rendering at only a quarter (25%) of it's original size, or scaling with significant blurring.
This app has a built-in zoom mode, which multiples the width and height of its text and images by a factor of 2, 3, or 4, dependant on the resolution of the display.  This does away for the need of the operating system to stretch/scale its pixels.
On a 2K monitor there is no need to scale as this is the app's intended resolution.  On a 4K monitor the app switches to a zoom factor of 200% (2x), upscaling text and images and the main window's dimension accordingly, and 400% (4x) on an 8K monitor.  The end result is an app that appears appropriately sized over different monitor resolutions.
You can override this automatic zoom function, and set your own zoom value of: 100%, 200%, 300%, or 400%, if desired.  An option that may be useful on a custom display resolution, and/or multiple monitor display environment.:
Setting the zoom value to 300% or above on a 2K monitor may render the app so large as to make it unusable.  If this occurs, you can press the "F2" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.⏶The text size (font size) can be set between 6 and 24.  Click "Options > Font" and choose a size option.  Any change updates the app text in realtime.
In some instances, the app may display slightly larger or smaller text in special areas, however this text is directly scaled from the size set.
By default the app uses a size of 10.:
Not all sizes are supported by all fonts.  On Ubuntu for instance, a large font size for Arial can cause text to appear weird or slightly off.  If this occurs, try reducing the font size a tad, or alternatively select another font (font name).⏶A font determines what sort of characters appear on the screen, and in what style.  Click "Options > Font" and choose a font name (font) from the list of options, from Arial to DejaVu Serif.  Any change updates the app in realtime.
Older fonts like "System" were simple formats constructed from small images or bitmaps, one per character, and did not scale up very well, partly because to save on memory, not all character sizes were stored inside the font.  Today, modern fonts use mathematical vectoring to draw shapes and lines etc to construct characters on the screen, though the infrastructure and overhead required for such fonts can be complex and heavy on a computer system.  But because these fonts employ mathematics to draw their characters, they do scale up well.
Eleven common font name options are presented for best compatibility and visual appearance, taking into consideration operating systems as old as Window 95, through to modern-day Windows 11, and other systems such as Mac and Linux.
In general, you want a font that is widely supported and guaranteed to render well on most computers.  Bearing that in mind, Arial, is a good choice, as it is widely supported by operating systems going as far back as Windows 95, if not further.
If a font name is selected but is not supported by the current computer, for example "DejaVu Sans" - not supported by Windows 95 - a close approximate/fallback font is used instead.
For a specific/custom font, click the "Custom" option once to switch it on, and click it again to display a Font dialog.  Choose the font name from the list of fonts and click the "OK" button when done.
If the app becomes unreadable, or hard to read after choosing a new font name - it can happen with a bad font, a foreign language font, or a symbols only font like "Wingdings" - press the "F2" key to restore the app's default settings.⏶For maximum font compatibility, two completely separate methods have been employed to render text with antialiasing.
Click "Options > Font" for font settings.
1. The first method, Font Feathering, is a simple feather designed specifically to outline each text character in realtime.  This has the effect of gently softening the often harsh outline of text characters on LCD screens, which by their nature do not blur neighbouring pixels, as the older CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes) did.
The feather is universally applied to both bitmap fonts (older image based fonts) and vectors fonts (newer mathematical fonts).  In this way it allows for a quick and direct text feathering technique, that is easily adjusted to suit, without any need for any complicated or tricky multi-step setup configurations and/or processes.
As a bonus, it works on older operating systems - e.g. Windows 95 - which back in the day had no need/support for it, as LCD monitors were not widely used.  It also works on fonts that don't have any embedded feather information, or for smaller font sizes that at times can abruptly discontinue feather support.
This method generates an even, edge-based blurring of the outermost pixels of the text characters.  A high value - high or ultra - renders a strong/bold feather, and a low value reduces this to a more subtle display.
Any change updates in realtime.
On a high quality computer monitor were all pixels are transmitted and displayed without any color loss, a "Low" value is typically sufficient to render text gently on the screen.  But TVs, which tend to heavily compress their video streams for speed loose some color information and therefore may require a higher setting of "Medium" or "High" for similar results.
2. The second method, Font Specific Antialiasing, relies on the font itself to provide all feather based information.  This is usually an 8 bit greyscale range of 0-255.  The downside is, if the font has no feather support, or the operating system is old, e.g. Windows 95, then no antialiasing will appear.  This method can sometimes be hit and miss.
For instance, take the font Arial, it is universally supported, but surprisingly looses feather support at 12 pt or less, leaving only sharp text characters to be rendered on screen.
To adjust the antialiasing strength, select an option from "Dark" (strong) to "Light" (subtle).
By default, options 1 and 2 above are set to "Low/Dark", which provides the best fit for a wide variety of fonts and their behavior over a broad spectrum of old and new operating systems.⏶The app can be set to start up in various ways: normally, minimised, maximised or in fullscreen mode.  To adjust, click "Options > Settings" and set an option under "Start Style".
Starts the app as a window, which is the default mode.
Starts the app hidden from view as a button on your taskbar.
Starts the app as a window, maximised to fill all the available work area on your desktop.
Starts the app in fullscreen mode, blocking out everything else on your desktop.:
If the app has the "Multi-Monitor" option selected (next section down named "Display"), then modes "Maximised" and "Fullscreen" will render the app over the combined screen real estate of all monitors.⏶The app can create, maintain and remove links for you.
There are three link types supported:
1. Start button
3. Automatic Startup
Click "Options > Settings" to adjust.
1. The first link type, Start button, creates and automatically maintains a link - also known as a shortcut - on your Start Menu called "Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com".  As this link is created by and maintained by the app, you must unselect the option to remove the link from your Start Menu.
2. The Desktop link operates identically to the above, maintaining a link on your Desktop named "Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com".  It also must be unselected to remove the link permanently from your Desktop.:
As long as either options 1 or 2 above is selected, then the corresponding links are maintained and automatically re-created if need be by the app, even if they're manually deleted from outside the app.
By default, neither option is selected.  Optionally, you can create your own manual link/shortcut to the app using Windows with any name/label you wish.
3. The last option, Automatic Startup, creates a link to the app in the startup location of your computer, informing Windows to launch the app when your computer boots/starts up.  Again, this link is automatically maintained, therefore unselect the option to remove it.:
If any of the links above are selected and you plan to remove/delete the app from your computer, it is highly recommended you first unselect all the options above (1-3), then remove/delete the app.  Otherwise, Windows can get a little weird and put the links back in some cases without any interaction from the app itself, even if the app is no longer present.  This behaviour was observed with earlier versions of Windows 10.⏶The majority of the app's important system settings can be found in one location - click "Options > Settings".
An option is considered "on/enabled/selected" when lit, and "off/disabled/unselected" when unlit.Round Corners:
Render all visual controls, windows, and dialogs with round (curved) corners.
Automatically close an active dialog window when a click/tap strikes outside the window area - e.g. Save, Open, Font, Options dialogs.  This can speed up typical workflows by skipping the need to specifically click the OK or Cancel buttons to close the dialog.  For instance, click "Options" to display the options dialog, change a few settings and click/tap outside the window to close it and save changes.  Also convenient to cancel a dialog displayed by mistake/change of mind, such as a Save dialog.
Retains app window on screen at all times, and any sub windows or dialogs within the app.  Any attempt to drag the app out-of-range triggers an automatic position correction - a passive system that continuously checks the window position and monitor size.  Supports both single and multi-monitor modes.
Displays an informative/artistic splash screen on app startup.  Unselect to disable.
Scrolls control-centric help across the top of the current window, dialog, or menu.  Hover mouse cursor over / tap finger on a control for related help.
Hover mouse over / tap finger on a control to display help related information in a popup bubble
Comfortably enlarge controls and menus for touch access (finger taps)
Some options work best with a double click / tap for confirmation.  This option supports the traditional double click mode.  For example, navigating a disk drive using a double click / tap to switch between folders.
Set the app above all other apps and windows
Normal app operation can use a lot of paint cycles and CPU power, especially if it's rendering graphics and effects continuously on the screen.  Economy mode throttles back this usage during periods of extended idleness, e.g. when there is no direct app keyboard input, or indirect mouse cursor movement or finger taps.  For more specific information refer to the topic "Economy mode".
Not noticeable on today's powerful computers with their 32 bit monitors and video cards, it however can deliver a small performance improvement on older computers running 24 bit graphics
Show the app's frame whilst maximised.  The frame is always hidden whilst in fullscreen mode.
An optional static or animated background scheme can be set, which renders an image beneath the GUI.  If this image is too bold / strong the GUI can be hard to view / use.  By default this option limits the background strength to a safe maximum level of 100.  Unselect this option to permit the full range of background strength (0-255).  If the GUI becomes hard to use or unreadable, press the "F2" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.
Permit the app to span the full range of attached monitors when maximised or in fullscreen mode.  By default the app spans the current monitor only.
Position the name of the app in the center of the app's window header
Align the content of all participating toolbars to the left, center, or to the right
Color coordinate important system settings and options into color specific input panels for rapid visual identification
Use high-contrast, color-adaptive, monochromatic tool images on the app's GUI
Retain highlight areas and other important GUI zones whilst a background scheme is in use
Adjust the brightness of the entire app, from 60 being the darkest right up to 130 being the brightest.  Any change takes affect immediately.  The default brightness is 100.
Renders the app translucent upon loosing focus - e.g. when another app is in use.  Available range is 30 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible.  Default value is 255.  This feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.
The speed by which to transition the app from a focused state to a non-focused state or vice-versa.  Speed range is 1-10, where 1 is the slowest and 10 the fastest.
Renders the app translucent upon gaining focus - e.g. when the user interacts with it.  Available range is 50 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible.  Default value is 255.  As above, this feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.
Change the default cursor to one of the built-in cursors, each of which scale from small to large, according to the current size set by the operating system.  A range of static colors are available: Red, Orange, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Aqua, Blue, Green, Grey, Black, White, along with Default and Custom.
In addition, two dynamically colored cursors are included: "Adaptive - Hover" and "Adaptive - Title".  These special cursors acquire their color from the current color scheme.  Any change to the color scheme is reflected in the color of the cursor.
The custom cursor option supports both static cursors ".cur" and animated cursor ".ani" file formats.  To use, select the "Custom" option.  The cursor will update if previously customised.  To change the cursor, click the option again and select a cursor from file using the Open dialog.
Applies a random texture to the app's frame.  Select a value from 0 (off) to 20 (bold).
Adjust the app's frame size (width in pixels) from 0 (none) to 72 (wide).  The default frame size is typically 7.
Set the width and/or height of the app's scrollbars.  A value of 5 (thin/short) to 72 (wide/tall) is supported.
Wine is basically a large computer instruction conversion app, which allows an app designed for Microsoft Windows to execute its instructions "run" on another operating system, such as a Mac or Linux.  Because Wine does not emulate / bridge any logic gaps and only translates an app's instructions, the underlying computer hardware must match that used by Microsoft Windows - namely Intel and AMD64.
A notable exception to this requirement is the modern-day Mac, e.g. Mac Mini, which runs an Intel emulator under the hood.  This allows a Microsoft Windows app to run by the following sequence: App to Wine to Intel emulator to Apple hardware.  Incredibly, this appears to be a very effective and rather efficient strategy, especially for our lightweight apps.
Although Wine's functionality is both wide and impressive, there is some functionality that falls short of Windows.  The Wine Compatibility option compensates where possible for important shortcomings, such as volume handling, and allows the app to maintain functionality.
The default option is automatic and detects the presence of Wine based on the existence of drive "Z:\".  For more information on Wine refer to their website www.winehq.org .  
Easily reset the app's system settings, such as color, font size, zoom level etc to their defaults.  Click the "Restore Defaults..." button at the bottom-right of the Options window or press the "F2" key at any time in the app to display the "Restore Defaults" confirmation prompt.  Confirm your intention to reset and then click the "Restore Defaults" button.  The app will reset to default values.
An app typically has settings in addition to these which are not restored / reset.  Instead, they should be adjusted via the app itself as required.⏶Click the app menu button  (top right) and tick "On Top" option.  Alternatively, click "Options > Settings" and select "Display > On Top" option.⏶By default the splash screen is displayed with a momentarily pause on startup.  This can be switched off by going to "Options > Settings" and deselecting the "Display > Show Splash" option.⏶Because this app is portable, you might not remember / know where it is located on your hard disk or usb pen stick.  To access its folder, click the app menu button  (top right) and select " Show App Folder".  An explorer window will display with the app's binary (*.exe) and storage folder listed alongside.⏶Running an app at full speed when it's not being used can be a bit wasteful, and may prematurely drain the batteries on your laptop or tablet.  Select this option to automatically throttle back battery / power consumption and CPU / graphic loads after a short idle period of 10 minutes.  At which point the app will reduce its paint cycles down to 2 fps at a maximum.  And a further reduction at 30 minutes to 1 fps.
Internal processing loads will typically be reduced also, lowering the demand on your CPU and batteries further.
A single stroke of the keyboard directed at the app, or a global mouse click, or tap of the finger will instantly disengage the current economy state and return the app back to full operation.
To enable, click "Options > Settings" and select "Display > Economy" option.⏶The Gossamer Code Foundation - our 4th generation codebase - which powers this app has been engineered with care and patience to a high level of quality and reliability.
As our code is rather unique and almost entirely custom built, there are some technical limitations which make our apps incompatible with some extended features of modern operating systems.
These limitations mainly concern the use of UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding of text, and more specifically filenames.  At this stage the app works with the legacy Windows-1252 character encoding for both text processing and filenames.  The app is therefore unable to handle foreign language text, or load and save files with special, foreign, or emoji characters in their filenames.  All text and filenames are restricted to english ASCII characters in the Windows-1252 encoding standard.
In addition, some options and minor operations may not work as expected, or at all on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.  Though an enormous amount of time and effort has gone into harmonising the look and feel, behaviour and reliability of the app across multiple flavours of Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems, it is not always possible to catch every failure point, or in some rare cases make it work properly, though we always endeavor to do our best.
A side note, our codebase is still running well as 32 bit code in 2025.  Yes, 32 bit!  Some might see this as a limitation, but we see it as a flexible, inexpensive, and widely adopted execution pathway with support for many platforms and reuse / life extension of older equipment.⏶A portable app is a big leap forward for apps in general.  A standard or traditionally engineered app requires a lot of support in the form of libraries, data files, images, scripts, etc and the list goes on.  You get the picture.  Some portable apps out there still include this bundle of bits, they merely offload it into a local folder.  A dump of goodies of sorts.
We tend to see a portable app in quite a different light.  Our vision of a portable app is designed tight, clean, free of bloat, and all data where possible is included directly within, structured right into the fabric of the app itself, and designed from the bare-metal up if required.
Though the most important difference between a traditional app and a portable app is that a portable app will not install on your computer.  This is extremely important as the installation process is often messy, and can clutter up your computer by dumping a lot of stuff all over the Windows file structure and registry, and over time may slow down and decrease the overall performance of your computer.
A portable app will not do this, which keeps your computer clean and running smooth and fast as it should.  Unfortunately most software is not designed with portable in mind.  They're more akin to a large leaky box of bits than tight engineering.  And because a portable app is not installed on your computer, it runs outside the normal scope of the operating system, and is not locked down or tied to it.  And thus can be moved about, from disk to disk, or computer to computer.
Typically a portable app will reside on a USB pen stick, removable media, or in a special folder on a portable hard disk.  This makes it easy to take from one computer to the next, and use over and over.  An immensely valuable freedom, and something an installed app can only dream of.
But a serious technical hurdle must be overcome for a truly portable app to be free.  And that is the humble setting.  Yes, a portable app must be able to handle it's settings on it's own.  It must be able to read them from disk, filter them, check and correct them where required, and write them back to disk.  All without the help of the Windows' registry or other operating system dependent structures.
An installed app typically can't or won't do this.  Instead, it relies on Windows and the registry to manage it's settings and other important data sets for it.  It therefore takes a higher degree of technical competence to escape this "tied to the operating system" situation.
Here is our current standard for a portable app: Require no installation or setup Require no additional DLL libraries to run and perform it's core function Make no alteration to the host operating system, or its settings, files, libraries or core functions, or the Windows registry, unless it forms a part or a whole of the app's core function, and then, only when initiated by the user Be able to run "out of the box" Require no compiling, conversion, installation or setup of support structures in order to execute, except for when such an environment constitutes an execution enabling environment, such as a command translation service like Wine Be free of zipped or otherwise externally bundled blob structures containing folders, files and bits Operate on less powerful hardware to facilitate operation on a broad spectrum of computers Less demanding API landscape to facilitate execution on a broad range of operating systems and software translation environments Require no special software libraries be present in order to run, such as .NET or JAVA, unless typically pre-installed on the target operating system or execution environment Not require an internet connection to run, unless the connection is required to fulfill the app's core function, such as a web server Require no downloads, addons, or registration in order to run Provide help and documentation offline via a built-in viewer, or by limited external means, such as Notepad Be self-contained with all necessary files, data sets, and samples stored within it's internal structure, such that access be provided preferably through direct enabling mechanisms Store, hold and manage external app settings and user data in a local sub-folder, and that sub-folder be easily identifiable as belonging to the app Provide a mostly consistent appearance and experience to the user across the widest possible range of operating systems and execution environments Value backwards compatibility, and be able to actively make use of that older hardware and software Possess a compact, bloat-free footprint⏶Make sure any app related data that is precious to you is backed up before you delete.As a portable app does not install itself on your computer there will be no automatic uninstall option listed in Windows.  The app must be removed manually.  But this is not difficult.
First, ensure the options below are unselected before proceeding.  Click "Options > Settings" and deselect:
1. Start button link
3. Automatic Startup link
If these links are not removed they may linger due to the oddities of some versions of Windows and it's often complex nature and protocols.
If this app is administered by a 3rd party system then that system should be used now to remove this app.  If not, then click the app menu button "" (top right) and select " Show App Folder".  An explorer window will display with the app's executable (*.exe) and storage folder listed.
Make sure any data precious to you has been backed up or moved out of the app's storage folder before proceeding.  When you're ready, close the app and right click on it's EXE "<app name>.exe" and select the Delete option.  If a prompt appears, confirm your intention to delete.  Repeat for the storage folder.
The app is now removed from your computer, USB pen stick, or hard disk.⏶If for some reason your app doesn't appear right, or you think you've turned on or off some important system setting but you're not sure which one or where, not too worry, you can restore the app's default settings in two easy steps.
From anywhere in the app press the "F2" key to display the "Restore Defaults" confirmation window.
When you're sure you're ready to proceed, click the "Restore Defaults" button.  The app will reset, restoring all key system settings to their safe defaults, this includes color, font size, zoom level etc.
If you don't have a keyboard, or the "F2" key is not available / difficult to access, you can click the "Options" link from the top toolbar to display the options window, then click the "Restore Defaults..." button (bottom right of window), and lastly confirm by pressing the "Restore Defaults" button.  The app will reset / restore defaults.⏶Copyright 2025 Blaiz Enterprises ( www.blaizenterprises.com )

DESCRIPTION
Olimpiu Pop speaks with Andrew Lamb, staff engineer at InfluxData and PMC member of Apache DataFusion and Apache Arrow, about how modern data systems are built using standardized open source components rather than being developed from scratch.

Andrew discusses the FDAP Stack (Flight, DataFusion, Arrow & Parquet), the shift from row-based to columnar data storage, and how technologies like Apache Iceberg are enabling a new era of interoperability across data platforms. The discussion covers why this modular approach saves years of development time while providing better performance and compatibility.

Its mission? To eliminate the repetitive grind of manual editing and empower content creators to produce viral-ready videos in minutes—no technical expertise needed.In today’s fast-paced digital world, where speed and storytelling are crucial, NemoVideo isn't just a tool—it's a game-changing AI Creative Buddy. Whether you're an independent creator, part of a marketing agency, or a brand looking to promote products, Nemo's AI-driven technology makes video creation faster and more intuitive, allowing you to "Drop anything. Skip the dirty work. Get viral-ready videos instantly."Solving the Challenges of Content CreationContent creators are facing more pressure than ever before. The grind of producing high-quality videos is draining—creative burnout, tight deadlines, and the never-ending struggle of turning raw footage into polished content. Manual editing tasks, such as syncing audio or matching visuals to the right shots, are often a logistical nightmare.This is where NemoVideo steps in. It automates time-consuming processes while retaining creative control, enabling creators to focus on the big picture: the story.The biggest hurdle in video production isn’t creativity—it’s getting started. Traditional tools demand knowledge of complex software and rigid formats. With Nemo, you don’t need to worry about compatibility or setup time. Whether it’s a product link, a draft script, or raw footage, simply drop it in. Nemo’s AI intelligently reads the content and kickstarts your project, extracting key elements like product highlights and tone to create a polished draft without the usual manual work.This flexibility preserves creative momentum. With Nemo, you're no longer bogged down by logistics or formatting issues. The system understands your vision and adapts, producing immediate, relevant results that get you from concept to completion faster.Inspiration Center: Beat Creative BlockOne of the most frustrating aspects of content creation is staring at a blank screen. What should you do to grab the audience’s attention in the first few seconds? Studies show that 71% of viewers decide whether to keep watching within the first three seconds. Weak openings can derail even the best ideas.NemoVideo’s Inspiration Center solves this problem. By analyzing millions of viral clips, it identifies trending topics, storytelling patterns, and hooks that capture attention. No more guesswork—just data-driven inspiration to help you craft compelling video ideas that resonate with viewers.The AI even allows you to upload reference videos, deconstruct them into detailed scripts, and generate powerful alternatives. It’s creativity on-demand.AI Editing That Actually WorksUnlike other so-called "AI editors" that churn out generic, cookie-cutter videos, Nemo’s AI is an intelligent creative assistant. It doesn’t just speed up the process—it makes your content more effective. Nemo's SmartPick engine eliminates filler words, awkward pauses, and irrelevant shots, assembling a rough cut that’s ready to be refined.What sets Nemo apart is its ability to enhance storytelling. Its contextual intelligence automatically matches B-roll footage to A-roll, removing the need for manual searching. This AI-powered engine knows how to build a cohesive narrative, adding the right visuals with minimal input from the user.From post-production to final output, Nemo handles everything—from subtitle generation (SmartCaption) to music syncing (SmartAudio) and lip-sync adjustments—ensuring every video feels polished and on-brand.Conversational Editing: No Technical Skills RequiredTraditional video editing often requires steep learning curves and technical expertise—something that many creators don’t have the time for. Nemo’s Conversational Editing changes that.Instead of wrestling with complex interfaces and keyframes, you simply type what you want to change in plain language. Whether it’s “shorten this scene” or “replace the background music,” Nemo executes the edit in real time. This intuitive approach makes editing accessible to everyone, removing the need for extensive technical knowledge or a team of experts.One of the biggest challenges for creators is ensuring their videos are optimized for each platform.

This isn't just about a clunky website, the changes actually put lives and safety at risk."The new platform did not allow people to enter GPS coordinates for their specific property locations, restricting searches to towns or postcodes."Families and farmers could not access vital, localised data such as river heights and rainfall information and this missing data created panic and fear across communities."But now, the fact the BOM has been hiding the true cost of its white elephant and initially lying about the total figure is deeply concerning, considering that the BOM should be all about trust."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Mars Orbiter Manuever Challenges Theory: That May Not Be an Underground Lake on Mars</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/0623250/new-mars-orbiter-manuever-challenges-theory-that-may-not-be-an-underground-lake-on-mars?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 12:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2018 researchers claimed evidence of a lake beneath the surface of Mars, detected by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding instrument (or Marsis for short). 

But new Mars observations "are not consistent with the presence of liquid water in this location and an alternative explanation, such as very smooth basal materials, is needed." Phys.org explains



Aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) uses higher frequencies than MARSIS. Until recently, though, SHARAD's signals couldn't reach deep enough into Mars to bounce off the base layer of the ice where the potential water lies — meaning its results couldn't be compared with those from MARSIS. However, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter team recently tested a new maneuver that rolls the spacecraft on its flight axis by 120 degrees — whereas it previously could roll only up to 28 degrees. The new maneuver, termed a "very large roll," or VLR, can increase SHARAD's signal strength and penetration depth, allowing researchers to examine the base of the ice in the enigmatic high-reflectivity zone. Gareth Morgan and colleagues, for their article published in Geophysical Research Letters, examined 91 SHARAD observations that crossed the high-reflectivity zone. 

Only when using the VLR maneuver was a SHARAD basal echo detected at the site. In contrast to the MARSIS detection, the SHARAD detection was very weak, meaning it is unlikely that liquid water is present in the high-reflectivity zone.

in deploying post-quantum cryptography is to deploy ECC+PQ.
IETF's TLS working group is standardizing ECC+PQ.
But IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document
through the IETF process,
a "non-hybrid" document that adds  as another TLS option.Don't worry: we're standardizing cars with seatbelts.
Also, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association,
we're going to standardize cars  seatbelts as another option,
ignoring the safety objections.
That's okay, right?Last month I posted
part 1
of this story.
Today's
part 2
highlighted the corruption.
This blog post, part 3,
highlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month
by an IETF "security area director".
Part 4
will give an example of how
dissent on this topic has been censored.Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do.
Recall from my previous blog post that
"adoption" of a document is a preliminary step
before an IETF "working group" works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document.
In April 2025,
the chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for "adoption" of this NSA-driven document.
During the call period,
20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption,
2 people expressed conditional support for adoption,
and 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption.
(Details for verification.)Before the chairs could even reply,
an "area director"
interrupted,
claiming, inter alia, the following:
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".After these lies by the "area director" were
debunked,
the chairs said that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft"
specifically "enough people willing to review the draft".I can understand not everybody being familiar with
the specific definition of "consensus" that
antitrust law
requires standards-development organizations to follow.
But it's astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure
that simply ignores objections.
The chairs said I could escalate.
IETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought
"to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered",
and then "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute".I filed a complaint with the "security area directors"
in early June 2025.
One of them never replied.
The other,
the same one who had claimed that there was "clearly consensus",
sent a series of excuses
for not handling the complaint.
For example, one excuse was that the PDF format "discourages participation".Do IETF procedures say "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute
unless the dispute is documented in a PDF"?
No.I sent email two days later
systematically addressing the excuses.
The "area director" never replied.It isn't clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal.
It is, however, clear that an appeal  be filed after two months.
I escalated to the "Internet Engineering Steering Group" (IESG)
in August 2025.(These aren't even marginally independent groups.
The "area directors" are the IESG members.
IESG appoints the WG chairs.)IESG didn't reply until October 2025.
It rejected one of the "Area Director" excuses for having ignored my complaint,
but endorsed another excuse.
I promptly filed a
revised complaint
with the "area director",
jumping through the hoops that IESG had set.
There were then further
runarounds.
Suddenly,
on 1 November 2025,
IESG publicly instructed the "area director" to address the following question:
"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"The "area director" posted his conclusion mere hours later:
"I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result
was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".Dodging procedural objections.
Before looking at how the "area director" argued for this conclusion,
I'd like to emphasize three things that the "area director"  do.First,
did the "area director" address my complaint
about the chair action on this topic?
No.One reason this matters is that
the law requires standards-development organizations to provide an
"appeals process".
Structurally,
the "area director" isn't quoting and answering the points in my complaint;
the "area director" puts the entire burden on the reader
to try to figure out what's supposedly answering what,
and to realize that many points remain unanswered.Second,
did the "area director" address the chairs claiming that
"we have consensus to adopt this draft"?
Or the previous claim from the "area director"
that there was "clearly consensus"?
No.
Instead IESG and this "area director"
quietly shifted from "consensus" to "rough consensus".
(Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG's "rough consensus" instruction?)One reason this matters is that
"consensus"
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
The law doesn't allow "rough consensus".
Also,
IETF claims that
"decision-making requires achieving broad consensus".
"broad consensus" is even stronger than "consensus",
since it's saying that there's consensus .Third,
the way that my complaint had established the
lack of consensus
was, first, by reviewing the general definition of "consensus"
(which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because
the TLS chairs had threatened me with a
list ban
if I mentioned the law again),
and then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand.
Did the area director follow this structure?
Here's the definition of "consensus", or "rough consensus" if we're switching to that,
and now let's apply that definition?
No.
Nobody reading this message from the "area director" can figure out what the "area director" believes these words mean.Wow, look at that:
"due process"
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
Part of due process is simply making clear what procedures are being applied.
Could it possibly be that the people writing the law
were thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?
Without further ado,
let's look at what the "security area director" did write.As noted above,
IESG had instructed the "area director" to answer the following question:
"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"Side note:
Given that the "area director" posted all of the following
on the same day that IESG instructed the "area director" to write this,
presumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG.
I guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025)
was to try to provide cover for the "last call" a few days later (5 November 2025).As noted above,
the TLS WG chairs had claimed "consensus",
and the "area director" had claimed that there was "clearly consensus".
The "area director" is now quietly shifting to a weaker claim."About 40"?
What happened to the "area director" previously writing
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call"?
And why is the number of messages supposed to matter in the first place?Messages after the specified adoption-call deadline can't justify the claim that
"the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".
The adoption call  to reach consensus.The fact that the ADs and IESG stonewalled in response to complaints
doesn't mean that they were "attempted" complaints.These numbers are  closer to reality
than the "area director" previously writing
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".Also, given that the "area director" is continually making claims that aren't true
(see examples below)
and seems generally allergic to providing evidence
(the text I'm quoting below has, amazingly,  URLs),
it's a relief to see the "area director" providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.But somehow, even after being
caught
lying about the numbers before,
the "area director" still can't resist shading the numbers a bit.The actual numbers were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.
Clearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly.
Let's check the details:How does the "area director" end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7?
  By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as "ambivalent"
  and falsely attributing a "prefer not, but okay if we do" position to Bellebaum.
  In fact,
  Bellbaum had
  written
  "I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids."
  (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell,
  who had written "I'm opposed to adoption, at this time.")How does the "area director" end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22?
  By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call.
  The "area director" seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues
  and probably doesn't find it obvious that an author  vote,
  but the simple fact is that the author  vote.
  She
  sentthreemessages
  during the call period;
  all of those messages are merely commenting on specific points,
  not casting a vote on the adoption question.The document author didn't object to the "area director" fudging the numbers.
Bellebaum did politely
object;
the "area director"
didn't argue,
beyond trying to save face with comments such as "Thanks for the clarification".More to the point,
the "area director" has never explained
whether or how the tallies of positive and negative votes
are supposed to be relevant to the "rough consensus" claim.
The "area director" also hasn't commented on IETF
saying
that IETF doesn't make decisions by voting.Bogus arguments for the draft.
I mentioned in my previous blog post that IETF
claims
that "IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole Internet,
not just the best solution for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user".Okay,
the "area director"
seems to have some basic awareness
that this document flunks the "engineering judgment" criterion.
The "area director" tries to defend this by saying that other documents flunk too.
So confidence-inspiring!Wrong.
Anything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ,
complies with NIST's standards when the PQ part does.
See
NIST SP 800-227:
"This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t > 1 if at least one
shared secret (i.e., S for some j) is generated from the key-establishment methods in SP
800-56A [1] or SP 800-56B [2] or an approved KEM."
For example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203,
then NIST allows ECC+PQ too.What's next:
claiming that using PQ in an Internet protocol would violate NIST standards
unless NIST has standardized that particular Internet protocol?I won't bother addressing the errors here,
since the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand.
The TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ;
the question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.You know what would be even less complicated?
Encrypting with the null cipher!There was a claim that PQ is less complex than ECC+PQ.
There was no response to
Andrey Jivsov
objecting that having a PQ option makes the ecosystem  complicated.
The basic error in the PQ-less-complex claim is that it ignores ECC+PQ already being there.How the "area director" described the objections.This is the closest that the "area director" comes to acknowledging the central security argument for ECC+PQ.
Of course, the "area director" spends as little time as possible on security.
Compare this to
my own objection
to adoption,
which started with SIKE as a concrete example of the dangers
and continued with
"SIKE is not an isolated example: https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp
shows that 48% of the 69 round-1 submissions to the NIST competition
have been broken by now".Hmmm.
By listing this as part of an "opposed argument summary",
is the "area director" suggesting that this was disputed?
When and where was the dispute?As noted above, I've seen
unquantified NSA/GCHQ fearmongering about costs,
but that was outside IETF.
If NSA and GCHQ tried the same arguments on a public mailing list
then they'd end up being faced with questions that they can't answer.When I wrote my own summary of the
objections,
I provided a quote and link for each point.
The "area director" doesn't do this.
If the "area director" is accurately presenting an argument that was raised,
why not provide a quote and a link?
Is the "area director" misrepresenting the argument?
Making up a strawman?
The reader can't tell.This comment about "weight" is revealing.
What we'll see again and again is that the "area director"
is expressing the weight that  places on each argument
(within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"),
i.e., the extent to which  is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs,
it's unsurprising that the "area directors", in their roles as IESG members,
will end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents.
But that isn't what this "area director" was instructed to do here.
There isn't a WG-approved document at this point.
Instead the "area director" was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs "appropriately"
called "rough consensus" to "adopt" the document.
The "area director" is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did.
Instead the "area director" is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.Incompetent risk management.I think that the "area director" is trying to make some sort of claim here
about ML-KEM not having been attacked,
but the wording is so unclear as to be unevaluatable.
Why doesn't KyberSlash count?
How about Clangover?
How about the continuing advances in lattice attacks
that have already reduced ML-KEM below its claimed security targets,
the most recent news being from
last month?More importantly,
claiming that ML-KEM isn't "known" to have problems
is utterly failing to address the point of the ECC seatbelt.
It's like saying
"This car hasn't crashed, so the absence of seatbelts isn't a basic flaw".Here the "area director" is reasonably capturing
a statement from one document proponent
(original wording:
"I find it
to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the quantum threat requires immediate work, and
yet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time").But I promptly
followed up
explaining the error:
"Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?"There was, of course, no reply at the time.
The "area director" now simply repeats the erroneous argument."Non-hybrid classics" is weird terminology.
Sometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called "classical",
so I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn't being phased out.
That's a bizarre claim.
There are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS
to try to protect against quantum computers.
Cloudflare
reports
the usage of post-quantum cryptography having risen to about 50% of all browsers that it sees
(compared to 20% a year ago);
within those connections,
95% use ECC+MLKEM768 and 5% use ECC+Kyber768.The "area director" also gives no explanation of
why the "not phasing out" claim is supposed to be relevant here.See how the "area director" is saying the weight that the "area director" places on each argument
(within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"),
rather than evaluating whether there was consensus to adopt the document?Circular argument.
There wasn't consensus to adopt the document in the first place.I think many readers will be baffled by this comment.
If something is "not recommended",
wouldn't that be an argument  standardizing it,
rather than an argument  standardizing it?The answer is that "not recommended" doesn't mean what you think it means:
the "area director" is resorting to confusing jargon.
I don't think there's any point getting into the weeds on this.Incompetent planning for the future.If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC,
there's a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having "less" value
and the extreme scenario of ECC having "no" value.
It's wrong for the "area director" to be conflating these possibilities.As I put it
almost two years ago:
"Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys.
Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that!
We don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break  key!
Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography.
But are the users going to say 'Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack'?
I'm skeptical.
I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value."Furthermore,
let's think for a moment about the idea
that one will eventually want to transition to ,
the specific proposal that the "area director" is portraying as the future.
Here are three ways that this can easily be wrong:Maybe ML-KEM's implementation issues
  end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option,
  analogously to what happened with ECC.Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives,
  but more efficient options also survive. 
  At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM.
  (Random example: SMAUG.
  The current SMAUG software isn't as fast as the ML-KEM software,
  but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.)
  Probably some options will be broken,
  but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.Does this "area director" think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won't?
Sounds absurdly overconfident.
More likely is that the "area director" doesn't even realize that there are more efficient options.
For anyone thinking "presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM":
we're talking about what to do long-term, remember?Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now.
Hopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster).
But, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years,
picking ML-KEM is premature.Here the "area director" is  attacking a strawman.How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience
that isn't gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?Also, I think it's important to call out the word "pure" here
as incoherent, indefensible marketing.
What we're actually talking about isn't modifying ML-KEM in any way;
it's simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs.
Is ML-KEM no longer "pure" when it's plugged into TLS,
which also hashes session keys?
(The word "pure" also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)Here we again see the area director making a decision to support the document,
rather than evaluating whether there was consensus in the WG to adopt the document.Again getting the complexity evaluation backwards.Here the "area director" is again
making the same mistake explained earlier:
ignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there,
and thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.The "thus add risk" logic is also wrong.
Again, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.Looking beyond TLS:
Chempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS),
making it robust for a wide range of protocols.
The other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings.
Each of these options is under 10 lines of code.
The "area director" exaggerates the complexity by mentioning "extensive discussions",
and spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk
than acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.Anyway,
it's not as if the presence of this document
has eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details,
nor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so.
Again, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option  ECC+PQ.
Adding that option  complexity.
The "area director" is getting the complexity comparison backwards
by instead comparing
(1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.Botching the evaluation of human factors.I would expect a purchasing manager to have instructions
along the lines of "Buy only products complying with the standards",
and to never see IETF's confusing jumble of further designations.From a security perspective,
it's a big mistake to ignore the human factor,
such as the impact of a purchasing manager saying
"This is the most efficient standard so I'll pick that".Is this supposed to have something to do with the consensus question?Ah, yes, "known to consume"!
There was, um,
one of those, uh, studies showing the details of, um, how implementors use RFCs,
which, uh, showed that 100% of the implementors diligently consumed the warnings in the RFCs.
Yeah, that's the ticket.
I'm sure the URL for this study is sitting around here somewhere.Let's get back to the real world.
Even if an implementor does see a "This document is a bad idea" warning,
this simply doesn't matter
when the implementors are chasing contracts issued by purchasing managers
who simply care what's standardized and haven't seen the warning.It's much smarter for the document to
(1) eliminate making the proposal that it's warning about
and (2) focus, starting in the title, on saying why such proposals are bad.
This makes people  likely to see the warning,
and at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.Fictions regarding country actions.Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process.
I tend to refer to it as a competition.
But in the end the selection of algorithms to standardize was made by NIST,
with input behind the scenes from NSA.Nonsense.
The premier multi-year effort by cryptographers to "publicly discuss post-quantum crypto candidates"
is the cryptographic literature.Here's the objection from
Stephen Farrell
that the "area director" isn't quoting or linking to:
"I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
   wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
   we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
   certainly arise".After reading this objection,
you can see how the "area director" is sort of responding to it
by suggesting that everybody is following NIST
(i.e., that the "certainly arise" part is wrong).But that's not true.
NIST's selections are controversial.
For example, ISO is
considering
not just ML-KEM but alsoClassic McEliece,
  where NIST has
  said
  it's waiting for ISO
  ("After the ISO standardization process has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece based on the ISO standard"),
  andFrodoKEM,
  which NIST
  said
  "will not be considered further for standardization".ISO is also now
considering
NTRU, where the
advertisement
includes "All patents related to NTRU have expired"
(very different from the ML-KEM situation).BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany,
recommends
not just ML-KEM
but also FrodoKEM (which it describes as "more conservative" than ML-KEM)
and Classic McEliece ("conservative and very thoroughly analysed").
Meanwhile China has called for
submissions
of new post-quantum proposals for standardization.I could keep going,
but this is enough evidence to show that Farrell's prediction was correct;
the "area director" is once again wrong.Notice how the "area director" is dodging Farrell's point.
If NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM,
why can't China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants?
What criteria will IETF use to answer this question
without leaving the WG "open to accusations of favouritism"?
If you want people to believe that it isn't about the money
then you need a  convincing alternative story.This is just rehashing earlier text,
even if the detailed wording is a bit different.Irrelevant.
The question is whether they're being standardized.Yes, NSA waving around money has convinced some corporations to provide software.
How is this supposed to justify the claim
that "there was rough consensus to adopt the document"?Repeating a claim doesn't make it true.Irrelevant.
What matters is whether the document is standardized.This sort of dismissal might be more convincing
if it were coming from someone providing more URLs and fewer easily debunked claims.
But it's in any case not addressing the consensus question.The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft"
(based on claiming that "there were enough people willing to review the draft",
never mind the number of objections).
That claim is wrong.
The call for adoption failed to reach consensus.The "area director" claimed that
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".
These statements still haven't been retracted;
they were and are outright lies about what happened.
Again, the
actual tallies
were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.Without admitting error,
the "area director" has retreated to a claim of "rough consensus".
The mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the "area director"
certainly doesn't demonstrate any coherent meaning of "rough consensus".It's fascinating that IETF's
advertising to the public
claims that IETF's "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus",
but IETF's
WG procedures
allow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of "rough consensus".
To be clear,
that's only if the "area director" approves of the documents,
as you can see from the same "area director"
issuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to
overturn
a separate chair decision in September 2025.You would think that the WG procedures would  "rough consensus".
They don't.
All they say is that
"51% of the working group does not qualify as 'rough consensus' and 99% is better than rough",
not even making clear whether 51% of  within a larger working group can qualify.
This leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US, Ukraine Signal Peace Talk Progress; BHP Walks Away From Anglo Again | Bloomberg Brief 11/24/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrGX61Vv8wo</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DrGX61Vv8wo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 11:52:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US equity futures rise ahead of a week of key economic data as traders increase their bets on a December rate cut.

Rubio’s note of caution followed US-Ukrainian talks on Sunday that both sides described as making progress toward a deal. Any agreement would require signoff by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as well as Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

The controversial 28-point plan dropped suddenly by the Trump administration to Ukraine as a take-it-or-leave it proposition mere days ago was mostly the result of several weeks of negotiations behind the scenes between Steve Witkoff and his Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev that excluded not only Ukraine and its allies but even some key US officials.

With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta. 

Technology stocks led gains in global equities as investors prepared for a week of key economic data amid rising expectations for a December US interest-rate cut.

Oil and European defense stocks edged lower as traders weighed prospects for a potential Ukraine-Russia peace deal. Ihor Brusylo, deputy head of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office discussed prospects for talks between Zelenskiy and US President Donald Trump in the coming days.

Correct: An on-screen graphic incorrectly said 'Defense Falls As UK-Russia Deal Talks Progress'. It should have said 'Defense Falls As US-Ukraine Deal Talks Progress'.

But when it comes to building production-grade product integrations, they consistently under-deliver.Claude Code can scaffold a React dashboard. Cursor can generate a backend with authentication. Lovable can design an entire user interface from a prompt. These tools have fundamentally changed how we build software.Except for one stubborn problem: Ask any AI agent to "build a Slack integration" and you'll get code. Clean code. Code that compiles. Code that  like it would work.But deploy it to production—where customers use different Slack workspace tiers, where rate limits vary by plan, where webhook signatures change format, where OAuth tokens expire unpredictably—and everything breaks.This isn't an AI problem. It's an infrastructure problem.For the past decade, we've tried addressing integrations with iPaaS platforms, unified APIs, and low-code builders. Each promised to make integrations easy. Each failed when customers needed anything beyond surface-level connectivity.Now, AI promises to democratize integration building like never before! And it will—but only if we give it the proper foundation to build on.But Why Does AI struggle with integrations?Building integrations isn't just about calling an API. Real product integrations are complex, full of edge cases, and require deep knowledge that AI agents simply don't have.There Are Three Fundamental problems:AI is optimized for Simplicity over Complexity.Real-world integrations are complex: authentication flows, error handling, rate limits, custom fields, etc. It is hard for AI to solve for all the necessary edge cases. AI can build simple integrations that work in perfect scenarios, but it can't reliably handle the complexity needed for production use.AI Agents Make Do with Insufficient ContextLike most junior devs, AI agents work with incomplete or outdated API documentation. They lack real-world experience with how integrations actually behave in production - the quirks, limitations, and nuances that only come from building hundreds of integrations across different apps.Missing feedback loop for AI AgentsAI doesn't have robust tools at its disposal to properly test integrations. Without a way to validate, debug, and iterate on integration logic, AI-generated code remains brittle and unreliable for production use.Testing integrations is not the same as testing your application code because it involves external systems that are hard or impossible to mock.The result? AI can produce code that  right, but won't actually work in many cases when your users connect their real-world accounts.The Solution: framework + context + infrastructureTo build production-grade integrations with AI, you need three things:1. A framework that breaks down complexityInstead of asking AI to handle everything at once, split integrations into manageable building blocks - connectors, actions, flows, and schemas that AI can reliably generate and compose.2. Rich context about real-world integrationsAI needs more than API documentation. It needs knowledge about how integrations actually behave in production: common edge cases, API quirks, best practices, and field mappings that work across different customer setups.3. Infrastructure for testing and maintenanceYou need tools that let AI test integrations against real external systems, iterate on failures, and automatically maintain integrations as external APIs evolve.With these three components, AI can reliably build production-grade integrations that actually work.How Membrane implements this solutionMembrane is specifically designed to build and maintain product integrations. It provides exactly what AI agents need: that decompose integration complexity into pieces AI can handle (see Membrane Framework)Specialized AI coding agent trained to build integrations (Membrane Agent)Proprietary operational knowledge from thousands of real-world integrations that run through Membrane.Tools and infrastructure for testing and validating integrations that work with live external systems.Imagine you're building a new integration for your product from scratch - connecting to an external app to sync data, trigger actions, or enable workflows.Step 1: Describe what you want to buildTell an AI agent what integration you need in natural language:"Create an integration that does [use case] with [External App]."The AI agent understands your intent and begins building a complete integration package that includes:Connectors for the target app.Elements that implement the integration logic - tested against live external system.API and SDK for adding the resulting integration into your app.Step 2: Test and validate the integrationIn the previous step, the agent does its best to both build and test the integration.You can review the results of its tests and, optionally, run additional tests of your own using the UI or the API.If you find issues, you ask the agent to fix them.Now plug the integration into your product using the method that works best for you. - Make direct HTTP calls to execute integration actions - Use a native SDK in your backend code - Expose integration context to AI coding agents - Connect tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf to Membrane and ask them to implement changes in your product.You described what you wanted once. AI did the rest.Enables users to connect external apps with secure, production-grade authExecutes your integration logic through tested, reusable actionsRuns on a reliable, stable integration infrastructure, powered by AIWhy is Membrane better than general-purpose AI coding agents?| Challenge | General-purpose AI Agents | Membrane |
|----|----|----|

Yet, the average manager spends less than two hours preparing for what is arguably the most critical conversation of the employee's year.The math doesn't add up. We spend months recruiting talent, thousands of dollars onboarding them, and countless hours managing them—only to risk losing them in a single, poorly handled 45-minute meeting.It’s not that managers don’t care. It’s that they are drowning in .Trying to recall a year’s worth of contributions, filter out recency bias, balance praise with critique, and articulate a clear growth path—all while worrying about legal compliance and morale—is a recipe for decision fatigue. The result? We default to "safe," generic feedback that frustrates top performers and confuses struggling ones.But what if the solution wasn't to spend  time, but to fundamentally change  we process performance data?There is a pervasive myth that using AI for performance reviews makes them "robotic" or "impersonal."I argue the exact opposite: AI is the tool that can make your reviews more human.When a human manager sits down to write a review, their brain is besieged by unconscious biases:: Overweighting events from the last month.: Letting one good trait overshadow serious flaws (or vice versa).Idiosyncratic Rater Effect: Measuring employees against the manager's own skills rather than the job requirements.An AI, properly instructed, doesn't have these biases. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't forget what happened in February. It doesn't hold a grudge because someone was late to a meeting three weeks ago.By offloading the  and  of performance data to an AI, you free up your mental energy for the part that actually requires a human: empathy, coaching, and career vision.The "Objectivity Engine" FrameworkTo turn an LLM (like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini) into an unbiased evaluation partner, you can't just say, "Write a review for Sarah." That yields the robotic fluff we want to avoid.You need a Persona-Driven Instruction that forces the AI to adopt the mental model of a seasoned HR specialist.I have developed a comprehensive prompt that acts as an "Objectivity Engine." It forces the AI to:: Evaluate based on specific skills, not general "vibes.": It requires specific examples for every claim.: It enforces a structure that acknowledges strengths while clearly defining growth areas.Here is the complete prompt framework.# Role Definition

- **Consistency**: Apply the same standards across all employees in similar roles

# Output Format

Deliver the performance review as a structured document with clear headings, professional formatting, and a signature block for both reviewer and employee acknowledgment.
From "Judging" to "Coaching"The real magic happens when you stop seeing the review document as the .With this prompt, the document is generated in seconds. This shifts your role entirely. Instead of spending 3 hours agonising over how to phrase "needs to communicate better," you spend those 3 hours:Reviewing the AI's output to ensure it aligns with your deeper intuition.Refining the "Development Plan" to match the employee's actual career aspirations.Preparing for the conversation itself—planning how to deliver the message with empathy and clarity.You move from being a "Report Writer" to being a "Performance Coach."Breaking the "Feedback Sandwich"We've all been taught the "Feedback Sandwich" (Good thing -> Bad thing -> Good thing). It’s outdated and transparent. Employees see right through it.This AI-driven approach encourages a . It forces you to look at the employee holistically.Maybe they are a 5/5 on  but a 2/5 on .The AI separates these distinctly, preventing the "Halo Effect" where their coding brilliance masks their toxic communication style.It forces you to address the gap specifically, rather than hiding it inside a compliment sandwich.Don't just copy-paste this prompt and hope for the best. Here is the workflow for maximum impact:: Open a voice note or a blank document. Spend 10 minutes dumping every raw observation you have about the employee. Don't worry about grammar or politeness. Just facts, numbers, and specific incidents.Example: "Great at Python, fixed the login bug in record time. But was rude to Sarah in the standup last Tuesday. Needs to speak up more in client meetings.": Feed that raw dump into the  section of the prompt.: Take the AI's output and apply your "Managerial Intuition." Does this  like you? Is the tone right for your specific relationship with this person?: Use the structured document as an agenda for your 1:1.Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind.When you use a structured framework to deliver performance reviews, you are giving your employees the greatest gift a manager can give: .They know exactly where they stand. They know exactly what "good" looks like. And they know you care enough to provide them with a roadmap, not just a grade.Stop letting cognitive overload dictate the quality of your leadership. Let the AI handle the structure, so you can handle the human.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Shai-Hulud Returns: Over 300 NPM Packages Infected</title><link>https://helixguard.ai/blog/malicious-sha1hulud-2025-11-24</link><author>mrdosija</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:40:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is Lasta App Worth It?

On my left wrist sits a smartwatch, on my right an Oura ring, and together they tell me I slept poorly last night and exactly how to improve it.Yes, I'm a healthtech geek, and I've tried countless apps. Most of them I deleted almost immediately. Honestly, I just didn't understand why I needed a separate app to track water intake, and I quickly tired of spending half an hour logging every ingredient of my dinner just to calculate calories and macros.Recently, however, I discovered  – an app that combines the functionality of several apps into one. You can track your food, work out, get a meal plan, track water, sleep and much more.So I gave it a try, and this is my honest review.Lasta is a wellness app assistant. Using technology to combine nutrition, workouts, psychology, and mindfulness, it aims to help users build lasting healthy habits rather than pursue quick fixes or restrictive diets.This app is designed for people of any age or gender who want to maintain a healthy weight, improve their lifestyle, and find support without "hardcore fitness" approaches. Lasta offers various diet plans and adaptive workouts that don't require any special physical training or equipment. All you need to do is dedicate some time and follow the visuals and instructions.Lasta's core philosophy centers on three pillars: transforming both body and mindset, building sustainable habits through small daily wins, and providing a judgment-free space for wellness.In addition, there is educational content on improving overall wellness and mental health. That’s what makes this app different from various tracking tools, making it a comprehensive lifestyle companion.First, the app learns everything about you. During onboarding, I was asked about my age, gender, current weight, height, activity level throughout the day, fitness goals, and lifestyle habits.Based on this information, Lasta creates an adaptive plan that includes customized workouts, meal guidance, and mindfulness lessons. The algorithm adjusts recommendations as you progress, ensuring the plan evolves with your changing needs and achievements.Depending on the user's goals, Lasta offers access to a variety of features:==Workouts==. The app offers exercises designed for all fitness levels. Lasta has tons of recorded videos with functional exercises, wall yoga and pilates, chair yoga and pilates, bed pilates — you don't need any equipment or physical training.==Intermittent fasting programs==. The app offers programs ranging from 7 to 21 days of fasting designed to regulate eating patterns, prevent aging, reduce inflammation, and support safe weight loss.==Trackers==. Lasta includes six essential trackers to help you monitor various aspects of your wellness journey: fasting, water, calories, weight, steps, and mood. All trackers integrate with Apple Health, allowing automatic synchronisation of activity, sleep, and step data for a complete picture of your health.==Meal Planning==. Lasta's meal planning features go beyond simple calorie counting. You can get a personalized meal plan or choose one of the diet options. In addition, using a barcode scanner, users can get all the nutritional information about packaged foods at the supermarket, making grocery shopping and meal logging effortless.==Habit-Building==. Instead of getting quick results, Lasta helps you to play long-term, supporting lasting change. This is achieved through gamification (a motivational “streaks” system), educational and self-care content, and mindfulness practices.My Experience Using LastaI signed up for Lasta to see if it could truly replace the multiple health apps cluttering my phone.The onboarding process was straightforward and took about ten minutes. After answering questions about my goals, current habits, and preferences, Lasta presented my personalized plan. I was immediately impressed by how the app explained  it recommended certain features based on my responses.I started with the easiest wins: workouts, tracking water intake, and setting up my first fasting window. The interface made this process feel effortless. Unlike other apps where I'd feel overwhelmed by too many features at once, Lasta has become my personal wellness and fitness partner. No aggressive push notifications or complicated exercises that I couldn't do in my small living room.By the end of the first week, daily workouts, hydration, and fasting had become consistent parts of my routine. At the end of the second week with Lasta, workouts and mindfulness lessons began to feel like a routine rather than chores. I found myself looking forward to my morning bed pilates session.My discovery is a wall and chair yoga. I used to think that yoga (and pilates, by the way) was boring, but now it's part of my routine. I work from home by spending 8 hours a day on my laptop, and then I continue sitting while studying, reading a book, or watching YouTube. I have developed the habit of taking quick breaks to move around, so now my body feels better, and I don't have back pain.After four weeks with Lasta, my life hasn't changed 180 degrees. As I said, I was already quite disciplined and cared about my health. But I started spending much less time on sports and stopped bombarding ChatGPT with questions about what to cook for dinner, as now I have a meal plan! Another bonus — I noticed less emotional eating.After using Lasta for a month, I identified the following pros and cons.Personalized and adaptive plans that evolve with your progressA combination of physical and mental wellness in one platformBarcode scanner and AI coach are so handyEasy start for beginners with no equipment requiredTrackers keep me motivatedA wide range of trackers and workouts eliminates the need for multiple appsAlgorithm sometimes struggles to find the ideal pace or level on the first tryIt would be nice to have more flexibility — for example, to change exercises manuallyThe main thing I noticed (and my smartwatch confirms) was that my energy levels increased. I don't know what exactly contributed to this — more movement, nutrition, better hydration, or the combination of all three — but I'm happy! I became more focused throughout the day and developed a habit of daily exercise.  I also like how my legs look now, would never have thought that pilates would help with this as much as exhausting workouts. Thanks to regular personalized exercises and nutrition, I don't have bloating and even see my abs.Lasta is definitely worth trying for those who are not looking for quick fixes but want to develop a long-term habit. Instead of paying for five different apps with workouts, trackers, diets, and mindfulness, it is more cost-effective to join Lasta and have all the information about your progress in one app. It's certainly my choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Writer&apos;s Paradox: Why Tech&apos;s Most Lucrative Skill Is Being Systematically Undervalued</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-writers-paradox-why-techs-most-lucrative-skill-is-being-systematically-undervalued?source=rss</link><author>Igboanugo David Ugochukwu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:28:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've watched this industry long enough to recognize a pattern: the moment something becomes genuinely indispensable, we start treating it as disposable.Last month, I sat across from a Series B founder—smart guy, former Google engineer, raised $40 million—who told me he was "optimizing content operations" by replacing his three-person editorial team with ChatGPT and a junior coordinator. Six weeks later, his product launch tanked. Not because the technology failed, but because nobody could explain what the damn thing actually did. The landing page read like a ransom note written by a committee of management consultants.This keeps happening. And it's costing companies far more than they're saving.The Market Signal Nobody's ReadingHere's what the numbers actually tell us, stripped of the usual content marketing chest-thumping: organizations maintaining consistent editorial operations see traffic increases around 55% over those that don't. But here's the part that matters—content marketing generates roughly three times more leads per dollar than traditional advertising, at 62% lower cost. I've verified these figures across finance, healthcare, and enterprise SaaS companies I've covered over the past eighteen months.That's not marginal improvement. That's a fundamental arbitrage opportunity sitting in plain sight while companies scramble to cut "soft" roles.The disconnect gets worse. Right now, there are over 550 open positions globally for content strategists, UX writers, and technical communicators. I checked the listings myself—companies are offering $120K to $180K for senior roles, sometimes more. These aren't legacy media organizations desperately clinging to tradition. They're fintech startups, cybersecurity vendors, AI infrastructure companies. The ones actually building the future are hiring writers, not firing them.I've covered enough product launches to spot the pattern: technical excellence means nothing if you can't articulate value. Last fall, I analyzed why a genuinely innovative zero-trust networking platform failed to gain traction despite superior architecture. The answer wasn't in their GitHub repository—it was in their documentation, which read like it had been translated from English into Esperanto and back again.Stephen Jeske, a content strategist I've quoted before, captured this precisely: quality writing "is the line between a brand people take seriously and one they forget before the page even loads." That's not romantic nonsense about the power of storytelling. It's a measurable business outcome. Security teams evaluating vendors can smell sloppy thinking in sloppy prose. When your whitepaper can't clearly explain threat models, I'm not trusting you with my network perimeter.The data supports this. Roughly 70% of buyers prefer learning about companies through substantive articles rather than advertisements. They're not being precious about format—they're seeking signal in an ocean of noise. A well-researched technical piece demonstrates competence. A breathless press release demonstrates desperation.The World Economic Forum identified creativity, originality, and initiative among the critical skills needed by 2025—we're there now, and the prediction held. But here's what the reports miss: technical writing isn't some quaint liberal arts holdover. Modern content creators are "strategists, data analysts, and a vital force behind any successful digital marketing campaign," as one workforce analysis puts it. They're reading user behavior analytics, running A/B tests on messaging, and translating product roadmaps into narratives that actually land.I've interviewed enough product marketers to know: the good ones operate like intelligence analysts. They synthesize customer interviews, competitive research, usage metrics, and technical specifications into coherent positioning. Then they translate that positioning into everything from API documentation to conference keynotes. You cannot automate that synthesis. I don't care what LLM benchmark you're citing.The companies figuring this out are winning. The ones treating writing as a commodity function that can be "optimized" with AI slop are discovering that generic, forgettable content performs exactly as well as you'd expect: not at all.Here's the part that should terrify every CFO: studies indicate up to 70% of business mistakes stem from miscommunication. Not bad strategy, not technical failure—unclear writing. When specifications are ambiguous, engineers build the wrong thing. When documentation is confusing, support tickets multiply. When internal memos are vague, teams execute opposing directions simultaneously.I watched this play out at a mid-stage security company last year. Their product documentation was technically accurate but incomprehensible. Support costs ballooned. Sales cycles stretched because prospects couldn't evaluate the product without hand-holding. They finally hired two senior technical writers who rewrote everything with actual clarity. Support tickets dropped 40% within three months. The payback period was roughly six weeks.Clear documentation allows teams to execute instead of seeking clarification. Well-written guides reduce user frustration and support load. These aren't soft benefits—they're hard dollars. Every hour your engineering team spends explaining poorly written requirements is an hour not spent building.The companies that understand this distinction will pull ahead. The ones that don't will drown in their own mediocrity while wondering why nobody engages with their "content."I've seen enough cycles to know: whatever can be automated will be automated, but synthesis, judgment, and clarity under complexity remain stubbornly human. The best writers in tech aren't competing with AI—they're using it as a drafting tool while applying the discernment, strategic thinking, and audience awareness that actually moves needles.The market is already sorting this out. Those 550+ open positions? They're not charity. They're recognition that in a landscape oversaturated with algorithmic drivel, clear human thinking commands a premium. Companies building genuinely complex products—the infrastructure, security tools, and enterprise platforms that actually matter—can't afford to be misunderstood.So here's the blunt assessment: if you think writing is a cost center to be minimized, your competitors who recognize it as a strategic capability will eat your lunch. The evidence isn't subtle. The choice is.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fact check: Are cows in Denmark dying over Bovaer additive?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNq95iq2D1I</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vNq95iq2D1I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:19:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fact check: Are cows in Denmark dying over Bovaer additive?

A system administrator deploys Microsoft's July security update across 600 virtual desktops. By the time the second cup of coffee hits the breakroom, the phones are ringing.By half past nine, the taskbars have vanished, the Start Menu won't launch, and Explorer.exe is running in name only—a ghost process presiding over a digital graveyard.This wasn't a glitch. This was KB5062553, and Microsoft stayed silent about it for 135 days.The Anatomy of Institutional FailureThe casualty list reads like an operating system's vital organs shutting down one by one: StartMenuExperienceHost, System Settings, the Taskbar, Explorer.exe. Each component either crashed on launch or failed silently, leaving users staring at blank screens and administrators scrambling for explanations that wouldn't arrive for four months.Microsoft finally acknowledged the crisis on 20 November. Not in July when IT departments first reported the failures. Not in August when Reddit threads and Microsoft Q&A forums erupted with reproductions. November. After enterprises had already bled resources trying to diagnose what Microsoft knew all along.The failure mechanism was almost elegant in its simplicity: a race condition at the heart of Windows' modern architecture.Three XAML dependency packages—Microsoft.Windows.Client.CBS, Microsoft.UI.Xaml.CBS, and Microsoft.Windows.Client.Core—needed to register before the Windows shell could load. KB5062553 broke that sequence. The shell showed up early, found the doors locked, and simply stopped functioning.First-time user logons became minefields. Non-persistent VDI environments—where every login provisions a fresh session—turned into operational nightmares. Each logon retriggered the registration timing failure. Each user got a broken desktop. Every. Single. Time.The symptoms manifested as black screens, phantom taskbars, Settings menus that clicked but never opened. One administrator described it as "Explorer.exe running but displaying sweet bugger all." That captures it precisely.The Enterprise Calculus: Choose Your DisasterBy June 2025, half of all enterprise Windows endpoints hadn't migrated to Windows 11. Just 42% of very large organisations—those managing over 10,000 devices—had completed the transition.The Americas sat at 43% completion despite 87% device readiness. Europe led at 70%. Different regions, different timelines, but the same brutal math.Windows 11 Enterprise accounts for 90% of corporate Windows 11 deployments. When KB5062553 detonated, it hit where modern business actually operates: the virtual desktop infrastructure supporting 63% of organisations that now rely solely on Desktop as a Service for remote work.The cloud-based VDI market is projected to reach $26.99 billion by 2034. Sixty-three percent of mid-sized companies are actively evaluating new VDI or DaaS solutions. Ninety-four percent plan implementation within a year. This wasn't a niche edge case. This was an infrastructure collapse at the operational core.Microsoft handed enterprises an impossible choice: deploy the security update and watch productivity crater, or hold back patches and risk audit failures.For universities managing thousands of daily student logins, financial services firms with regulatory patching requirements, and healthcare providers balancing HIPAA compliance, KB5062553 didn't offer solutions. It offered crises.Microsoft's official response, documented in support article KB5072911, prescribed PowerShell commands to manually re-register the broken XAML packages. For individual machines, administrators could run the commands, restart the SiHost process, and move on.For VDI environments experiencing failures at every login? Microsoft recommended synchronous logon scripts forcing Explorer.exe to wait whilst dependencies sorted themselves. The scripts add measurable delays to login times and operational complexity to what should be straightforward deployments.These aren't fixes. They're economic impositions: increased logon times, scripting and testing efforts, helpdesk ticket surges, forced rollback plans.The costs cascade through organisations managing thousands of endpoints, each one a reminder that Microsoft shipped code incapable of reliably registering its own dependencies.Microsoft issued no public ETA for a permanent fix. No device-level impact counts. No transparent telemetry on scale. The institutional knowledge came from community forums, not official channels. Reddit threads documented the exact workarounds Microsoft would eventually publish months later.This wasn't transparency delayed. This was negligence dressed as "working on a resolution."The timing compounds the failure. Windows 10 reaches end-of-support in October 2025. Enterprises are racing against that deadline, navigating hardware requirements forcing device refreshes, wrestling with legacy application compatibility.They cross the finish line into Windows 11 24H2 only to discover their freshly deployed environments can't display a functioning Start Menu.Windows 11 25H2 shares the same codebase as 24H2. The problem cascades forward, not backwards.KB5062553 wasn't isolated. Nvidia pointed to Microsoft's latest Patch Tuesday update today, citing game performance issues serious enough to warrant an emergency hotfix driver. This comes days after Microsoft's Windows chief faced backlash over plans for a more agent-driven operating system.Modern OS modularisation—breaking Windows into updateable AppX/XAML packages for faster servicing—sounds transformative until the modular components forget to synchronise.Then you're left with enterprises running jerry-rigged PowerShell scripts because foundational architecture can't coordinate its own startup sequence.Somewhere right now, an administrator is staring at a blank taskbar, clutching cold coffee, recalculating career choices. The lesson isn't about bugs—software has bugs. The lesson is about what happens when the gap between breaking infrastructure and acknowledging the break spans four months and millions of affected endpoints.Microsoft eventually came clean.

I decided to write this article after seeing two OOP-related articles on Lobsters in quick succession. I’m not interested in defending or attacking OOP, but I do want to throw in my two cents and offer a more nuanced view.The industry and the academy have used the term “object-oriented” to mean so many different things. One thing that makes conversations around OOP so unproductive is the lack of consensus on what OOP is.What is Object-Oriented Programming? Wikipedia defines it as “a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.” This definition is unsatisfactory, as it requires a definition of an “object” and fails to encompass the disparate ways the term is used in the industry. There is also Alan Kay’s vision of OOP. However, the way most people use the term has drifted apart, and I don’t want to fall into essentialism or etymological fallacy by insisting on a “true” meaning.Instead, I think it is better to treat OOP as a mixed bag of interrelated ideas and examine them individually. Below, I will survey some ideas related to OOP and mention their pros and cons (in my subjective mind).Object-oriented programming is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships. — Grady BoochClasses extend the idea of a “struct” or “record” with support for the method syntax, information hiding, and inheritance. We will talk about those specific features later.Classes can also be viewed as blueprints for objects. It is not the only way to do that, and  is an alternative pioneered by Self and, most famously, used by JavaScript. Personally, I feel that prototypes are harder to wrap one’s head around compared to classes. Even JavaScript tries to hide its usage of prototypes from newcomers with ES6 classes.In Japanese, we have sentence chaining, which is similar to method chaining in Ruby — Yukihiro MatsumotoThe method syntax is one of the less controversial OOP features. It captures common programming use cases involving operations on a specific subject. Even in languages without methods, it is common to see functions effectively serve as methods by taking the relevant data as their first argument (or last, in languages with currying).The syntax involves method definitions and method calls. Usually, languages supporting methods have both, unless you consider the “pipe operators” in functional languages as a form of method call.The method call syntax aids IDE autocompletion, and method chaining is often more ergonomic than nested function calls (similar to the pipe operator in functional languages).There are some debatable aspects of the method syntax, too. First, in many languages, methods are often not definable outside of a class, which causes a power imbalance compared to functions. There are certain exceptions, such as Rust (methods are always defined outside of the struct), Scala, Kotlin, and C# (extension methods).Second, in many languages,  or  is implicit. This keeps the code more concise, but it can also introduce confusion and increase the risk of accidental name shadowing. Another drawback of an implicit this is that it is always passed as a pointer, and its type cannot be changed. This means you cannot pass it as a copy, and sometimes this indirection leads to performance issues. More importantly, because the type of this is fixed, you cannot write generic functions that accept different  types. Python and Rust got  right from the start, and C++ just fixed this issue in C++23 with deducing this.Fourth, the dot notation is used for both instance variable accesses and method calls in most languages. This is an intentional choice to make methods look more uniform with objects. In certain dynamically typed languages where methods are instance variables, this is fine and pretty much not even a choice. On the other hand, in languages like C++ or Java, this can cause confusion and shadowing problems.Its interface or definition was chosen to reveal as little as possible about its inner workings — [Parnas, 1972b]In Smalltalk, all instance variables are not directly accessible from outside the object, and all methods are exposed. More modern OOP languages support information hiding via access specifiers like  at the class level. Even non-OOP languages usually support information hiding in some way, be it module systems, opaque types, or even C’s header separation.Information hiding is a good way to prevent invariant from being violated. It is also a good way to separate frequently changed implementation details from a stable interface.Nevertheless, aggressively hiding information may cause unnecessary boilerplate or abstraction inversion. Another criticism comes from functional programmers, who argue that you don’t need to maintain invariants and thus don’t need much information hiding if data is . And, in a sense, OOP encourages people to write mutable objects that must be maintained as invariants.Information hiding also encourages people to create small, self-contained objects that “know how to handle themselves,” which leads directly into the topic of encapsulation.If you can, just move all of that behavior into the class it helps. After all, OOP is about letting objects take care of themselves. — Bob Nystrom, Game Programming PatternsEncapsulation is often confused with information hiding, but the two are distinct. Encapsulation refers to bundling data with the functions that operate on it. OOP languages directly support encapsulation with classes and the method syntax, but there are other approaches (e.g., the module system in OCaml).The most common construct for encapsulation is objects, but it is not the only mechanism. Many modern languages also support closures (in fact, closures and objects can simulate each other). There are also other lesser-known approaches, such as modules found in the ML family.Separation of interface and implementation is an old idea closely related to information hiding, encapsulation, and abstract data type. In some sense, even C’s header files can be considered an interface, but OOP usage of “interface” most often refers to a specific set of language constructs that support polymorphism (typically implemented via inheritance). Usually, an interface can’t contain data, and in more restricted languages (e.g., early versions of Java), they can’t contain method implementations either. The same idea of an interface is also common in non-OOP languages: Haskell type classes, Rust traits, and Go interfaces all serve the role of specifying an abstract set of operations independent of implementations.Interface is often considered a simpler, more disciplined alternative to full-blown class inheritance. It is a single-purpose feature and doesn’t suffer from the same diamond problem that plagues multiple inheritance.Interface is also extremely useful in combination with parametric polymorphism, since it allows you to constrain the operations a type parameter must support. Dynamically-typed languages (and C++/D template) achieve something similar through duck-typing, but even languages with duck-typing introduce interface constructs later to express constraints more explicitly (e.g., C++ concepts or TypeScript interfaces).The interface as implemented in OOP languages often has a runtime cost, but that’s not always the case. For example, C++ concepts is an example that only supports compile-time, and Rust’s trait only has opt-in runtime polymorphism support via .OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things — Alan KayLate binding refers to delaying the lookup of a method or a member until runtime. It is the default of most dynamic-typed languages, where method calls are often implemented as a hash table lookup, but can also be achieved with other means, such as dynamic loading or function pointers.A key aspect of late binding is that behaviour can be changed while the software is still running, enabling all kinds of hot-reloading and monkey-patching workflows.The downside of late binding is its non-trivial performance cost. Moreover, it can also be a footgun for breaking invariants or even interface mismatches. Its mutable nature can also introduce subtler issues, for example, the “late binding closures” pitfall in Python.A concept related to late binding is dynamic dispatch, in which the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at runtime. The two concepts overlap, though dynamic dispatch focuses more on selecting multiple known polymorphic operations rather than on name lookup.In a dynamically typed language, dynamic dispatch is the default since everything is late-bound. In statically typed languages, it is usually implemented as a virtual function table that looks something like this under the hood:These languages also provide compile-time guarantees that the vtable contains valid operations for the type.Dynamic dispatch can be decoupled from inheritance, whether by manually implementing a v-table (e.g., C++‘s “type-erased types” such as ) or an interface/trait/typeclass kind of constructs. When not paired with inheritance, dynamic dispatch alone is usually not considered “OOP.”Another thing to note is that the pointer to the v-table can be directly inside the object (e.g., C++) or embedded in “fat pointers” (e.g., Go and Rust).programming using class hierarchies and virtual functions to allow manipulation of objects of a variety of types through well-defined interfaces and to allow a program to be extended incrementally through derivation  — Bjarne StroustrupInheritance has a long history, way backed to Simula 67. It is probably the most iconic feature of OOP. Almost every language marketed as “object-oriented” includes it, while languages that avoid OOP typically omit it.It can be damn . In many cases, using an alternative approach will result in significantly more boilerplate.On the other hand, inheritance is a very non-orthogonal feature. It is a single mechanism that enables dynamic dispatch, subtyping polymorphism, interface/implementation segregation, and code reuse. It is flexible, though that flexibility makes it easy to misuse. For that reason, some languages nowadays replace it with more restrictive alternative constructs.There are some other problems with inheritance. First, using inheritance almost certainly means you are paying the performance cost of dynamic dispatch and heap allocation. In some languages, such as C++, you can use inheritance without dynamic dispatch and heap allocation, and there are some valid use cases (e.g., code reuse with CRTP), but the majority of uses of inheritance are for runtime polymorphism (and thus rely on dynamic dispatch).Finally, inheritance hierarchies are rigid. They suffer from issues like the diagonal problem, and that inflexibility is one of the main reasons people prefer composition over inheritance. The component pattern chapter of Game Programming Patterns provides a good example.If for each object  of type  there is another object  of type  such that for all programs  defined in terms of , the behavior of  is unchanged when  is substituted for , then  is a subtype of . — Barbara Liskov, “Data Abstraction and Hierarchy”Subtyping describes an “is a” relation between two types. The Liskov substitution principle defines the property that safe subtyping relationships must uphold.OOP languages often support subtyping via inheritance, but note that inheritance doesn’t always model subtyping, and it is not the only form of subtyping either. Various interface/trait constructs in non-OOP languages often support subtyping. And besides , where one explicitly declares the subtyping relationship, there are also , where the subtyping is implicit if one type contains all the features of another type. Good examples of structural subtyping include OCaml (objects and polymorphic variants) and TypeScript interfaces. Subtyping also shows in all kinds of little places, such as Rust lifetime and TypeScript’s coercion from a non-nullable type to its nullable counterpart.A related concept to subtyping is variance (not related to class-invariant), which bridges parametric polymorphism and subtyping. I won’t bother explaining variance here, as this topic probably needs an entire blog post to explain well. It is a great ergonomic boost (e.g., C++ pointers will be unusable for polymorphic use if they are not covariant), but most languages only implement a limited, hard-coded version, because it is hard to understand and also error-prone. In particular, mutable data types should usually be invariant, and Java/C#‘s covariant arrays are a primary example on this gone wrong. Only a few languages allow programmers to explicitly control variance, including Scala and Kotlin.Type conversion via subtyping relationships is often implicit. Implicit conversion has a bad reputation. Though doing it with subtyping is ergonomic, and is probably the least surprising kind of implicit conversion. Another way to view subtyping is as the dual of implicit conversions. We can “fake” a subtyping relation with implicit conversion. For example, C++ templated types are invariant, but  achieves covariance with an implicit conversion from  to . Does Go Have Subtyping? is a good article to further explore this idea.One reason that language designers often try to avoid subtyping is the implementation complexity. Integrating bidirectional type inference and subtyping is notoriously difficult. Stephen Dolan’s 2016 thesis Algebraic Subtyping makes good progress addressing this issue.I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages — Alan KayMessage passing means using objects that send each other “messages” as a way of execution. It is the centric theme of Alan Kay’s vision of OOP, though the definition can be pretty vague. An important point is that message names are late-bound, and the structures of these messages are not necessarily fixed at compile time.Many early object-oriented concepts were influenced by distributed and simulation systems, where message passing is natural. However, in the era where most people work on single-threaded code, the message was gradually forgotten in languages such as C++ and Java. The method syntax only has limited benefit compared to the original message-passing idea (Bjarne Stroustrup was definitely aware of the idea from Simula, but there is practical constraint on how to make it fast). There was still some genuine message passing, but only in specific areas such as inter-process communication or highly event-driven systems.Message passing gains a Renaissance in concurrent programming, ironically through non-OOP languages like Erlang and Golang, with constructs such as actors and channels. This kind of shared-nothing concurrency removed a whole range of data race and race condition bugs. In combination with supervision, actors also provide fault tolerance, so that the failure of one actor will not affect the entire program.In general, a rule of thumb is: use classes and objects in situations where open recursion is a big win. — Real World OCamlOriginating in the famous Types and Programming Languages,  is probably the least well-known and understood term in this blog post. Nevertheless, it just describes a familiar property of object-oriented systems: methods for an object can call each other, even if they are defined in different classes in the inheritance hierarchy.The term is somewhat misleading, as there may not be recursive function calls, but here “recursion” means “mutually recursive.” The word “open” refers to “open to extension,” typically empowered by inheritance.It’s easiest to see with an example:For anyone with some familiarity with OOP, we probably take open recursion for granted, even though we may not be aware of its name. However, not all language constructs have this property. For example, in many languages, functions are not mutually recursive by default:Now, in languages with late-bound functions, functions in the same module can always call each other (e.g., Python, JavaScript). There are other languages where functions are mutually recursive by default (e.g., Rust), or have forward declarations (C) or a  construct (Scheme and ML family) to make functions mutually recursive. This solves the “recursion” part, but still not the “open” part yet:Let’s fix this problem by using a callback:Tada, we just reinvented prototype-style dispatch!Anyway, with my quick example above, I want to show that open recursion is a property that OOP gives for free, but reproducing it in languages without built-in support can be tricky. Open recursion allows interdependent parts of an object to be defined separately, and this property is used in many instances, for example, the entire idea of decorator pattern depends on open recursion.Perhaps the more common complaints about OOP are not about specific language features, but rather about the programming styles it encourages. Many practices are taught as universal best practices, sometimes with rationales, but their downsides are often omitted. Some examples popped into my mind arepreferring polymorphism over tagged union/if/switch/pattern matchingOpen to extension, easier to add new cases.Performance hit; Related behaviors get scattered in multiple places; harder to see the whole controll flow in one placemaking all data members privateMore boilerplates; Often unnecessary to hide data without invariants; Getter/setter pairs work less well compared to direct access in languages without property syntaxpreferring small “self-managed” objects over central “managers”Harder to violate invariants, cleaner code organizationPotential bad data locality, missing parallelism opportunities, and duplicated references to common data (“back pointer”)Prevent new features from breaking the old one. Prevent API breakNo reason to “close” a non-public module where you own its usage. Leads to unnecessary complexity and inheritance chain; poorly designed interfaces are not changed; Can cause abstraction inversionpreferring abstraction over concrete implementationsMaking more system swappable and testableOveruse sacrifices readability and debuggability. Performance cost of extra indirectionThis blog post is long enough, so I will not go into more details. Feel free to disagree with my “advantages and disadvantages”. What I want to convey is that almost all those practices come with trade-offs.Congratulations on making it to the end of this article! There are other topics I’d love to discuss, such as RAII and design patterns. However, this article is long enough, so I will leave those for you to explore on your own.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How An MIT Student Awed Top Economists With His AI Study - Until It All Fell Apart</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/0429245/how-an-mit-student-awed-top-economists-with-his-ai-study---until-it-all-fell-apart?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 09:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In May MIT announced "no confidence" in a preprint paper on how AI increased scientific discovery, asking arXiv to withdraw it. The paper, authored by 27-year-old grad student Aidan Toner-Rodgers, had claimed an AI-driven materials discovery tool helped 1,018 scientists at a U.S. R&D lab. 

But within weeks his academic mentors "were asking an unthinkable question," reports the Wall Street Journal. Had Toner-Rodgers made it all up?
Toner-Rodgers's illusory success seems in part thanks to the dynamics he has now upset: an academic culture at MIT where high levels of trust, integrity and rigor are all — for better or worse — assumed. He focused on AI, a field where peer-reviewed research is still in its infancy and the hunger for data is insatiable. What has stunned his former colleagues and mentors is the sheer breadth of his apparent deception. He didn't just tweak a few variables. It appears he invented the entire study. In the aftermath, MIT economics professors have been discussing ways to raise standards for graduate students' research papers, including scrutinizing raw data, and students are going out of their way to show their work isn't counterfeit, according to people at the school. 



Since parting with the university, Toner-Rodgers has told other students that his paper's problems were essentially a mere issue with data rights. According to him, he had indeed burrowed into a trove of data from a large materials-science company, as his paper said he did. But instead of getting formal permission to use the data, he faked a data-use agreement after the company wanted to pull out, he told other students via a WhatsApp message in May... On Jan. 31, Corning filed a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization against the registrar of the domain name corningresearch.com. Someone who controlled that domain name could potentially create email addresses or webpages that gave the impression they were affiliated with the company. WIPO soon found that Toner-Rodgers had apparently registered the domain name, according to the organization's written decision on the case. Toner-Rodgers never responded to the complaint, and Corning successfully won the transfer of the domain name. WIPO declined to comment... 

In the WhatsApp chat in May, in which Toner-Rodgers told other students he had faked the data-use agreement, he wrote, "This was a huge and embarrassing act of dishonesty on my part, and in hindsight it clearly would've been better to just abandon the paper." Both Corning and 3M told the Journal that they didn't roll out the experiment Toner-Rodgers described, and that they didn't share data with him.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe Today: European counterproposal to US-Ukraine peace plan</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_FZkw6VtYI</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/A_FZkw6VtYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 08:59:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Euronews will launch its new daily live programme “Europe Today”, with accompanying newsletter and podcast, just one of several new formats available on the channel.

Learning how functional
languages are implemented? Gaining a bit of practical experience with
x86-64 assembly language? If so, I invite you to try your hand at the
projects in my class,
CIS531. CIS531 is a masters-level
class on compiler design which assumes that (a) you know how to
program, (b) you’ve had some exposure to C (know about stack
allocation, malloc, etc.), and (c) have seen some assembly code. My
class projects are in the Racket programming language, but if you
don’t know Racket, it is quite easy to learn: I have a set of YouTube
video lectures that teach Racket
quickly!
If you’ve never heard of Racket before, or you’re skeptical of
functional programming, indulge me for a bit: there’s no hardcore FP
theory or math in this course, and Racket is genuinely the best
language to use for this specific setup.My class follows Prof. Jeremy Siek’s excellent book, “Essentials of
Compilation.” While I highly recommend buying the book and supporting
Prof. Siek, I will also note that there are free online preliminary
editions
floating around; in my class, I followed the free version and
suggested that students buy the book if doing so fit their
goals. However, along with the book, I also have a set of class slides
along with sporadic course videos, both available on the class
website.This class builds up to a compiler with the following features:Variables and assignment via Integer arithmetic via  and Reading inputs / printing outputBooleans, conjunctions/disjunctions (and/or)Branching via , integer comparisons (<, etc.)Assignment / mutation ()Fixed-arity functions and function applicationLambdas (closures at runtime)The unique combination of features lets us tour an interesting
cross-section of programming languages, exploring both imperative
programming with loops and mutation but also functional programming
with lists and recursion.To be specific, I challenge you to complete five projects, each
including a comprehensive test suite that will seriously stress the
correctness of your implementation. p1 is a warmup project (you should
skip if you already know Racket), but p2-5 build a compiler for a set
of increasingly-complex languages to x86-64. The languages nest inside
of each other, with p2 giving us straight-line arithmetic, p3 giving
us decision trees, p4 giving us loops and mutation, and p5 giving us
functions, recursion, and lambdas.The projects are designed with one key principle in mind: get us to
the most expressive/fun language possible, as fast as possible. In
doing this, we sacrifice a lot that might be typically covered:Our languages aren’t type/memory safe, we assume the programmer is
correctNo register allocation (possible to add, not too hard)No garbage collection of any kind: we . We could
trivially support the Boehm GC (I have done that in the past), but
it was another static library to link in and I really wanted to make
this self contained.We support a  limited set of builtins (but it is trivial to
add more)So even after project 5, getting to a “real” compiler would take a bit
of effort. The most important (in my opinion) are (a) memory safety
(the language needs to be safe, period) via dynamic type tagging and
(b) slightly more builtins, and (c) register allocation. That would
get us to a respectable compiler. After that, we could add more
language features, or optimize the ones we have, e.g., by using
abstract interpretation.Our language will include functions, loops, branching, assignment, and
even heap-allocated vectors. As an example of the power, here’s a
Sudoku solver written in the language(program

To get you booted up fast as possible, every single project is
designed the same way: – Your pass implementations. You will edit functions provided here.
-> This is the  file you will edit! The rest are read-only – IR definitions and predicates like , , etc. (see also typed/shrunk variants) – Reference interpreters for several IRs (used by tests and for your own debugging). – System/ABI configuration, pass names, runtime filenames, output paths, etc. – Driver that runs all passes, can build a binary, and can launch a debug server. – Test harness. Runs isolation tests or end-to-end native tests depending on  mode. – Minimal runtime (, , etc.). – Example programs (). – Input streams for programs (lines of integers). – Instructor goldens (IR snapshots, interpreter outputs, and stdout baselines).You write your code in , which consists of a set of
. Each pass transforms an input language into an output
language, and these intermediate languages (IRs) are codified via
predicates in . To define the meaning of each IR, we give an
interpreter for each in . For the compiler to be
correct, it needs to be the case that–for all input streams–the
compiler produces the same output stream across all intermediate
IRs. There is some system-specific stuff in , which takes
care of things like Linux vs. Mac ABI issues, specifying register
names, etc. The  file acts as a main compiler entrypoint,
and it carefully runs each pass of the compiler, checking predicates
before/after each pass and interpreting each IR, checking to ensure
consistency. This is a  win for debugging, in my opinion: you
 want to localize errors to the proximate pass which causes
misinterpretation, and  seriously aids debugging in my
experience. There is also more comprehensive test infrastructure in
; this test script is invoked by the Python-based test
scripts in . These tests check the behavior of the compiler on
the programs in the  directory, using the files from
 as inputs and comparing to the outputs in .Why Is This Course Unique and Cool?You build a , all the way to actual x86-64
assembly.Each IR has a corresponding interpreter, which is easy to find/read
and written in a familiar style, giving semantic clarity and
testable correctness.The project is , meaning that you can use it as
a base for building your own language. Of course, this is thanks to
Dr. Siek’s great “incremental” design.It is fully testable across multiple passes, which helps
anticipate the thing we all fear most about writing a compiler:
seeing a problem that is the ramification of far-away code from
higher up in the compilation pipeline.It is written in a simple, pure recursive style. Just plain old
pattern matching and recursion here, no need for any complex
abstractions.Familiarize yourself with the course webpage: https://kmicinski.com/cis531-f25If you don’t know Racket, start with project 1: https://kmicinski.com/cis531-f25/projects/1Otherwise, start with project 2: https://kmicinski.com/cis531-f25/projects/2When you finish each project, move on to the next!When you’re done, start building your  language. Consider
adding type (checking/inference), classes, more builtins, pattern
matching, continuations, exceptions, algebraic effects. The options
are myriad, but once you’ve finished projects 2-5, you’ve built a
whole compiler for a surprisingly expressive language.Thank you to the National Science Foundation and OthersIf you like this work and live in the United States, please feel
commensurately less bad about paying your taxes. I made the whole
class free, at least as free as I could given practical
constraints. This class work on compilation is partially supported by
our NSF PPoSS
large,
which has already produced manycoolmajorresults. In
subsequent explorations, I am hoping that I can use this class
compiler as a baseline for highly-scalable engines that reason about
programs. Given the simple, self-contained nature–and the presence of
per-pass interpreters and consistency testing–I see this as an
awesome potential baseline for cool extensions.My course is of course heavily inspired by Prof. Siek’s book and
course, along with inspiration from Thomas Gilray at Washington
State. Eight years ago, Tom and I took a spontaneous trip to see the
eclipse halfway across the country (skipping out on the ICSE ‘17
deadline basically); we discussed compiler design over a steamed
seafood buffet in Myrtle Beach after napping in a cheap motel, having
been awake for over 24 hours and feeling the eclipse had made it worth
it. We sketched out his whole compiler on that roadtrip, and ever
since that night eating steamed crabs, I wanted to build my own course
compiler. Now that I have, I am not sure it compares to waking up for
just four hours of twilight, only to consume copious amounts of butter
and shellfish as the brisk ocean air wisps over your face, the
closures and continuations softly washing rhythmically through the
conversation as you walk along the beach back to your $50 motel room.In closing, thanks for checking this out, this compiler was a ton of
fun to build. Even as someone who has some amount of expertise in
compiler design, building it and getting it 100% right (I hope!) was
such a rewarding experience. My real sincere hope is that it offers
students (and you!) a fun journey. If you end up doing anything this,
please get in touch: kkmicins@syr.edu. I’d love to see what you come
up with. Best wishes,Kristopher Micinski

James and Owen were among 41 students who took a coding module at the University of Staffordshire last year, hoping to change careers through a government-funded apprenticeship programme designed to help them become cybersecurity experts or software engineers. But after a term of AI-generated slides being read, at times, by an AI voiceover, James said he had lost faith in the programme and the people running it, worrying he had "used up two years" of his life on a course that had been done "in the cheapest way possible". 

"If we handed in stuff that was AI-generated, we would be kicked out of the uni, but we're being taught by an AI," said James during a confrontation with his lecturer recorded as a part of the course in October 2024. James and other students confronted university officials multiple times about the AI materials. But the university appears to still be using AI-generated materials to teach the course. This year, the university uploaded a policy statement to the course website appearing to justify the use of AI, laying out "a framework for academic professionals leveraging AI automation" in scholarly work and teaching... 

For students, AI teaching appears to be less transformative than it is demoralising. In the US, students post negative online reviews about professors who use AI. In the UK, undergraduates have taken to Reddit to complain about their lecturers copying and pasting feedback from ChatGPT or using AI-generated images in courses. 

"I feel like a bit of my life was stolen," James told the Guardian (which also quotes an unidentified student saying they felt "robbed of knowledge and enjoyment".) But the article also points out that a survey last year of 3,287 higher-education teaching staff by edtech firm Jisc found that nearly a quarter were using AI tools in their teaching.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>BHP Drops Anglo Bid; Rubio Sees Ukraine Leeway | Bloomberg: The Asia Trade 11/24/25</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n40IY8nFoBE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n40IY8nFoBE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:19:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Bloomberg: The Asia Trade" brings you everything you need to know to get ahead as the trading day begins in Asia.

"government cell phone detected" will elicit a palpable reaction. In
Department of Energy facilities across the country, incidences of employees
accidentally carrying phones into secure areas are reduced through a sort of
automated nagging. A device at the door monitors for the presence of a tag;
when the tag is detected it plays an audio clip. Because this is the government,
the device in question is highly specialized, fantastically expensive, and
says "government cell phone" even though most of the phones in question are
personal devices. Look, they already did the recording, they're not changing
it now!One of the things that I love is weird little wireless networks. Long ago I
wrote about ANT+,
for example, a failed personal area network standard designed mostly around
fitness applications. There's tons of these, and they have a lot of
similarities---so it's fun to think about the protocols that went down a
completely different path. It's even better, of course, if the protocol is
obscure outside of an important niche. And a terrible website, too? What more
could I ask for.The DoE's cell-phone nagging boxes, and an array of related but more critical
applications, rely on an unusual personal area networking protocol called RuBee.RuBee is a product of Visible Assets Inc., or VAI, founded in 2004  by John K.
Stevens. Stevens seems a somewhat improbable founder, with a background in
biophysics and eye health, but he's a repeat entrepreneur. He's particularly fond of companies
called Visible: he founded Visible Assets after his successful tenure as CEO of
Visible Genetics. Visible Genetics was an early innovator in DNA sequencing, and
still provides a specialty laboratory service that sequences samples of HIV in
order to detect vulnerabilities to antiretroviral medications.Clinical trials in the early 2000s exposed Visible Genetics to one of the more
frustrating parts of health care logistics: refrigeration. Samples being shipped
to the lab and reagents shipped out to clinics were both temperature sensitive.
Providers had to verify that these materials had stayed adequately cold throughout
shipping and handling, otherwise laboratory results could be invalid or incorrect.
Stevens became interested in technical solutions to these problems; he wanted
some way to verify that samples were at acceptable temperatures both in storage
and in transit.Moreover, Stevens imagined that these sensors would be in continuous communication.
There's a lot of overlap between this application and personal area networks (PANs),
protocols like Bluetooth that provide low-power communications over short ranges.
There is also clear overlap with RFID; you can buy RFID temperature sensors.
VAI, though, coined the term  to describe RuBee. That's
visibility as in asset visibility: somewhat different from Bluetooth or RFID,
RuBee as a protocol is explicitly designed for situations where you need to
"keep tabs" on a number of different objects. Despite the overlap with other
types of wireless communications, the set of requirements on a visibility network
have lead RuBee down a very different technical path.Visibility networks have to be highly reliable. When you are trying to keep
track of an asset, a failure to communicate with it represents a fundamental
failure of the system. For visibility networks, the ability to actually convey
a payload is secondary: the main function is just reliably detecting that
endpoints exist. Visibility networks have this in common with RFID, and indeed,
despite its similarities to technologies like BLE RuBee is positioned mostly as
a competitor to technologies like UHF RFID.There are several differences between RuBee and RFID; for example, RuBee uses
active (battery-powered) tags and the tags are generally powered by a complete
4-bit microcontroller. That doesn't necessarily sound like an advantage, though.
While RuBee tags advertise a battery life of "5-25 years", the need for a battery seems
mostly like a liability. The real feature is what active tags enable: RuBee
operates in the low frequency (LF) band, typically at 131 kHz.At that low frequency, the wavelength is very long, about 2.5 km. With such a
long wavelength, RuBee communications all happen at much less than one wavelength
in range. RF engineers refer to this as near-field operation, and it has some
properties that are intriguingly different from more typical far-field RF
communications. In the near-field, the magnetic field created by the antenna is
more significant than the electrical field. RuBee devices are intentionally
designed to emit very little electrical RF signal. Communications within a RuBee network are
achieved through magnetic, not electrical fields. That's the core of RuBee's magic.The idea of magnetic coupling is not unique to RuBee. Speaking of the near-field,
there's an obvious comparison to NFC which works much the same way. The main difference,
besides the very different logical protocols, is that NFC operates at 13.56 MHz.
At this higher frequency, the wavelength is only around 20 meters. The requirement
that near-field devices be much closer than a full wavelength leads naturally to
NFC's very short range, typically specified as 4 cm.At LF frequencies, RuBee can achieve magnetic coupling at ranges up to about 30
meters. That's a range comparable to, and often much better than, RFID inventory
tracking technologies. Improved range isn't RuBee's only benefit over RFID. The
properties of magnetic fields also make it a more robust protocol. RuBee promises
significantly less vulnerability to shielding by metal or water than RFID.There are two key scenarios where this comes up: the first is equipment stored in
metal containers or on metal shelves, or equipment that is itself metallic. In
that scenario, it's difficult to find a location for an RFID tag that won't suffer
from shielding by the container. The case of water might seem less important, but
keep in mind that people are made mostly of water. RFID reading is often unreliable
for objects carried on a person, which are likely to be shielded from the reader
by the water content of the body.These problems are not just theoretical. WalMart is a major adopter of RFID inventory
technology, and in early rollouts struggled with low successful read rates. Metal,
moisture (including damp cardboard boxes), antenna orientation, and multipath/interference
effects could cause read failure rates as high as 33% when scanning a pallet of goods.
Low read rates are mostly addressed by using RFID "portals" with multiple antennas.
Eight antennas used as an array greatly increase read rate, but at a cost of over
ten thousand dollars per portal system. Even so, WalMart seems to now target a
success rate of only 95% during bulk scanning.95% might sound pretty good, but there are a lot of visibility applications where
a failure rate of even a couple percent is unacceptable. These mostly go by the
euphemism "high value goods," which depending on your career trajectory you may
have encountered in corporate expense and property policies. High-value goods
tend to be items that are both attractive to theft and where theft has particularly
severe consequences. Classically, firearms and explosives. Throw in classified
material for good measure.I wonder if Stevens was surprised by RuBee's market trajectory. He came out of
the healthcare industry and, it seems, originally developed RuBee for cold
chain visibility... but, at least in retrospect, it's quite obvious that its
most compelling application is in the armory.Because RuBee tags are small and largely immune to shielding by metals, you
can embed them directly in the frames of firearms, or as an aftermarket
modification you can mill out some space under the grip. RuBee tags in
weapons will read reliably when they are stored in metal cases or on
metal shelving, as is often the case. They will even read reliably when a
weapon is carried holstered, close to a person's body.Since RuBee tags incorporate an active microcontroller, there are even more
possibilities. Temperature logging is one thing, but firearm-embedded RuBee
tags can incorporate an accelerometer (NIST-traceable, VAI likes to emphasize)
and actually count the rounds fired.Sidebar time: there is a long history of political hazard around "smart guns."
The term "smart gun" is mostly used more specifically for firearms that
identify their user, for example by fingerprint authentication or detection of
an RFID fob. The idea has become vague enough, though, that mention of a
firearm with any type of RFID technology embedded would probably raise the
specter of the smart gun to gun-rights advocates.Further, devices embedded in firearms that count the number of
rounds fired have been proposed for decades, if not a century, as a means of
accountability. The holder of a weapon could, in theory, be required to
positively account for every round fired. That could eliminate incidents of
unreported use of force by police, for example. In practice I think this is
less compelling than it sounds, simple counting of rounds leaves too many
opportunities to fudge the numbers and conceal real-world use of a weapon as
range training, for example.That said, the NRA has long been vehemently opposed to the incorporation of any sort of
technology into weapons that could potentially be used as a means of state
control or regulation. The concern isn't completely unfounded; the state of
New Jersey did, for a time, have legislation that would have made user-identifying
"smart guns" mandatory if they were commercially available. The result of
the NRA's strident lobbying is that no such gun has ever become commercially
available; "smart guns" have been such a political third rail that any firearms
manufacturer that dared to introduce one would probably face a boycott by most
gun stores. For better or worse, a result of the NRA's powerful political
advocacy in this area is that the concept of embedding security or accountability
technology into weapons has never been seriously pursued in the US. Even a
tentative step in that direction can produce a huge volume of critical press
for everyone involved.I bring this up because I think it explains some of why VAI seems a bit vague
and cagey about the round-counting capabilities of their tags. They position it
as purely a maintenance feature, allowing the armorer to keep accurate tabs on
the preventative maintenance schedule for each individual weapon (in armory
environments, firearm users are often expected to report how many rounds
they fired for maintenance tracking reasons). The resistance of RuBee tags
to concealment is only positioned as a deterrent to theft, although the idea
of RuBee-tagged firearms creates obvious potential for security screening.
Probably the most profitable option for VAI would be to promote RuBee-tagged
firearms as tool for enforcement of gun control laws, but this is
a political impossibility and bringing it up at all could cause significant
reputational harm, especially with the government as a key customer. The result
is marketing copy that is a bit odd, giving a set of capabilities that imply
an application that is never mentioned.VAI found an incredible niche with their arms-tracking application. Institutional
users of firearms, like the military, police, and security forces, are relatively
price-insensitive and may have strict accounting requirements. By the mid-'00s,
VAI was into the long sales cycle of proposing the technology to the military.
That wasn't entirely unsuccessful. RuBee shot-counting weapon inventory tags were
selected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 2010 for installation on SCAR
and M4 rifles. That contract had a five-year term, it's unclear to me if it was
renewed. Military contracting opened quite a few doors to VAI, though, and
created a commercial opportunity that they eagerly pursued.Perhaps most importantly, weapons applications required an impressive round of
safety and compatibility testing. RuBee tags have the fairly unique distinction
of military approval for direct attachment to ordnance, something called "zero
separation distance" as the tags do not require a minimum separation from
high explosives. Central to that certification are findings of intrinsic safety
of the tags (that they do not contain enough energy to trigger explosives) and
that the magnetic fields involved cannot convey enough energy to heat anything
to dangerous temperatures.That's not the only special certification that RuBee would acquire. The military
has a lot of firearms, but military procurement is infamously slow and mercurial.
Improved weapon accountability is, almost notoriously, not a priority for the
US military which has often had stolen weapons go undetected until their later
use in crime. The Navy's interest in RuBee does not seem to have translated to
more widespread military applications.Then you have police departments, probably the largest institutional owners of
firearms and a very lucrative market for technology vendors. But here we run
into the political hazard: the firearms lobby is very influential on police
departments, as are police unions which generally oppose technical accountability
measures. Besides, most police departments are fairly cash-poor and are not
likely to make a major investment in a firearms inventory system.That leaves us with institutional security forces. And there is one category
of security force that are particularly well-funded, well-equipped, and
beholden to highly R&D-driven, almost pedantic standards of performance:
the protection forces of atomic energy facilities.Protection forces at privately-operated atomic energy facilities, such as
civilian nuclear power plants, are subject to licensing and scrutiny by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Things step up further at the many facilities
operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Protection
forces for NNSA facilities are trained at the Department of Energy's National
Training Center, at the former Manzano Base here in Albuquerque. Concern over
adequate physical protection of NNSA facilities has lead Sandia National
Laboratories to become one of the premier centers for R&D in physical security.
Teams of scientists and engineers have applied sometimes comical scientific rigor to "guns,
gates, and guards," the traditional articulation of physical security in the
nuclear world.That scope includes the evaluation of new technology for the management of
protection forces, which is why Oak Ridge National Laboratory launched an
evaluation program for the RuBee tagging of firearms in their armory. The
white paper on this evaluation is curiously undated, but citations "retrieved 2008"
lead me to assume that the evaluation happened right around the middle of the
'00s. At the time, VAI seems to have been involved in some ultimately unsuccessful
partnership with Oracle, leading to the branding of the RuBee system as Oracle
Dot-Tag Server. The term "Dot-Tag" never occurs outside of very limited materials
around the Oracle partnership, so I'm not sure if it was Oracle branding for
RuBee or just some passing lark. In any case, Oracle's involvement seems to have
mainly just been the use of the Oracle database for tracking inventory data---which
was naturally replaced by PostgreSQL at Oak Ridge.The Oak Ridge trial apparently went well enough, and around the same time, the Pantex
Plant in Texas launched an evaluation of RuBee for tracking classified tools.
Classified tools are a tricky category, as they're often metallic and often stored
in metallic cases. During the trial period, Pantex tagged a set of sample classified
tools with RuBee tags and then transported them around the property, testing the
ability of the RuBee controllers to reliably detect them entering and exiting areas of
buildings. Simultaneously, Pantex evaluated the use of RuBee tags to track containers
of "chemical products" through the manufacturing lifecycle. Both seem to have
produced positive results.There are quite a few interesting and strange aspects of the RuBee system, a
result of its purpose-built Visibility Network nature. A RuBee controller can have
multiple antennas that it cycles through. RuBee tags remain in a deep-sleep mode
for power savings until they detect a RuBee carrier during their periodic wake
cycle. When a carrier is detected, they fully wake and listen for traffic. A
RuBee controller can send an interrogate message and any number of tags can respond,
with an interesting and novel collision detection algorithm used to ensure
reliable reading of a large number of tags.The actual RuBee protocol is quite simple, and can also be referred to as IEEE 1902.1
since the decision of VAI to put it through the standards process. Packets are
small and contain basic addressing info, but they can also contain arbitrary payload in both directions,
perfect for data loggers or sensors. RuBee tags are identified by something that VAI
oddly refers to as an "IP address," causing some confusion over whether or not VAI
uses IP over 1902.1. They don't, I am confident saying after reading a whole lot of
documents. RuBee tags, as standard, have three different 4-byte addresses. VAI refers
to these as "IP, subnet, and MAC,"  but these names are more like analogies.
Really, the "IP address" and "subnet" are both configurable arbitrary addresses,
with the former intended for unicast traffic and the latter for broadcast. For example,
you would likely give each asset a unique IP address, and use subnet addresses for
categories or item types. The subnet address allows a controller to interrogate for
every item within that category at once. The MAC address is a fixed, non-configurable
address derived from the tag's serial number. They're all written in the formats
we associate with IP networks, dotted-quad notation, as a matter of convenience.And that's about it as far as the protocol specification, besides of course the
physical details which are a 131,072 Hz carrier, 1024 Hz data clock, either ASK
or BPSK modulation. The specification also describes an interesting mode called
"clip," in which a set of multiple controllers interrogate in exact synchronization
and all tags then reply in exact synchronization. Somewhat counter-intuitively,
because of the ability of RuBee controllers to separate out multiple simultaneous
tag transmissions using an anti-collision algorithm based on random phase shifts
by each tag, this is ideal. It allows a room, say an armory, full of RuBee
controllers to rapidly interrogate the entire contents of the room. I think this
feature may have been added after the Oak Ridge trials...RuBee is quite slow, typically 1,200 baud, so inventorying a large number of assets
can take a while (Oak Ridge found that their system could only collect data on 2-7
tags per second per controller). But it's so robust that it an achieve a 100% read
rate in some very challenging scenarios. Evaluation by the DoE and the military
produced impressive results. You can read, for example, of a military experiment in
which a RuBee antenna embedded in a roadway reliably identified rifles secured in
steel containers in passing Humvees.Paradoxically, then, one of the benefits of RuBee in the military/defense context
is that it is also  to receive. Here is RuBee's most interesting trick:
somewhat oversimplified, the strength of an electrical radio signal goes as 1/r,
while the strength of a magnetic field goes as 1/r^3. RuBee equipment is optimized,
by antenna design, to produce a minimal electrical field. The result is that RuBee
tags can very reliably be contacted at short range (say, around ten feet), but are
virtually impossible to contact or even detect at ranges over a few hundred feet.
To the security-conscious buyer, this is a huge feature. RuBee tags are highly
resistant to communications or electronic intelligence collection.Consider the logical implications of tagging the military's rifles. With
conventional RFID, range is limited by the size and sensitivity of the antenna.
Particularly when tags are incidentally powered by a nearby reader, an adversary
with good equipment can detect RFID tags at very long range. VAI heavily references
a 2010 DEFCON presentation, for example, that demonstrated detection of RFID tags
at a range of 80 miles. One imagines that opportunistic detection by satellite is feasible for
a state intelligence agency. That means that your rifle asset tracking is also
revealing the movements of soldiers in the field, or at least providing a way to
detect their approach.Most RuBee tags have their transmit power reduced by configuration, so even the
maximum 100' range of the protocol is not achievable. VAI suggests that typical
RuBee tags cannot be detected by radio direction finding equipment at ranges
beyond 20', and that this range can be made shorter by further reducing transmit
power.Once again, we have caught the attention of the Department of Energy. Because of
the short range of RuBee tags, they have generally been approved as not representing
a COMSEC or TEMPEST hazard to secure facilities. And that brings us back to the
very beginning: why does the DoE use a specialized, technically interesting, and
largely unique radio protocol to fulfill such a basic function as nagging people
that have their phones? Because RuBee's security properties have allowed it to be
approved for use adjacent to and inside of secure facilities. A RuBee tag, it is
thought, cannot be turned into a listening device because the intrinsic range
limitation of magnetic coupling will make it impossible to communicate with the
tag from outside of the building. It's a lot like how infrared microphones still
see some use in secure facilities, but so much more interesting!VAI has built several different product lines around RuBee, with names like
Armory 20/20 and Shot Counting Allegro 20/20 and Store 20/20. The founder started
his career in eye health, remember. None of them are that interesting, though.
They're all pretty basic CRUD applications built around polling multiple RuBee
controllers for tags in their presence.And then there's the "Alert 20/20 DoorGuard:" a metal pedestal with a RuBee
controller and audio announcement module, perfect for detecting government
cell phones.I put a lot of time into writing this, and I hope that you enjoy reading
it. If you can spare a few dollars, consider supporting me on
ko-fi. You'll receive an occasional extra,
subscribers-only post, and defray the costs of providing artisanal, hand-built
world wide web directly from Albuquerque, New Mexico.One of the strangest things about RuBee is that it's hard to tell if it's still
a going concern. VAI's website has a press release section, where nothing has been
posted since 2019. The whole website feels like it was last revised even longer
ago. When RuBee was newer, back in the '00s, a lot of industry journals covered it
with headlines like "the new RFID." I think VAI was optimistic that RuBee could
displace all kinds of asset tracking applications, but despite some special
certifications in other fields (e.g. approval to use RuBee controllers and tags
around pacemakers in surgical suites), I don't think RuBee has found much success
outside of military applications.RuBee's resistance to shielding is impressive, but RFID read rates have improved
considerably with new DSP techniques, antenna array designs, and the generally
reduced cost of modern RFID equipment. RuBee's unique advantages, its security
properties and resistance to even intentional exfiltration, are interesting but
not worth much money to buyers other than the military.So that's the fate of RuBee and VAI: defense contracting. As far as I can tell,
RuBee and VAI are about as vital as they have ever been, but RuBee is now installed
as just one part of general defense contracts around weapons systems, armory
management, and process safety and security. IEEE standardization has opened the
door to use of RuBee by federal contractors under license, and indeed, Lockheed
Martin is repeatedly named as a licensee, as are firearms manufacturers with military
contracts like Sig Sauer.Besides, RuBee continues to grow closer to the DoE. In 2021, VAI appointed Lisa
Gordon-Hagerty to it board of directors. Gordon-Hagerty was undersecretary of
Energy and had lead the NNSA until the year before. This year, the New Hampshire
Small Business Development Center wrote a glowing profile of VAI. They described
it as a 25-employee company with a goal of hitting $30 million in annual revenue in the
next two years.Despite the outdated website, VAI claims over 1,200 RuBee sites in service. I wonder
how many of those are Alert 20/20 DoorGuards? Still, I do believe there are military
weapons inventory systems currently in use. RuBee probably has a bright future, as a
niche technology for a niche industry. If nothing else, they have legacy installations
and intellectual property to lean on. A spreadsheet of VAI-owned patents on RuBee,
with nearly 200 rows, encourages would-be magnetically coupled visibility network inventors
not to go it on their own. I just wish I could get my hands on a controller....]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Japan&apos;s gamble to turn island of Hokkaido into global chip hub</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8676qpxgnqo</link><author>1659447091</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 03:07:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or "Hokkaido Valley", as some have begun to call it - the country could become a new contender in the $600bn (£458bn) race to supply the world's computer chips.At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.The government has invested $12bn in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or "fab" in the small city of Chitose.In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty. Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.The high-tech machinery helped bring about Rapidus' biggest accomplishment yet earlier this year – the successful production of prototype two nanometre (2nm) transistors.These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.It's a feat only rival chip makers TSMC and Samsung have accomplished. Intel is not pursuing 2nm, it is leapfrogging from 7nm straight to 1.8nm."We succeeded in manufacturing the 2nm prototype for the first time in Japan, and at an unprecedented speed in Japan and globally," Mr Koike said.He credits the IBM partnership for helping achieve the breakthrough.Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.Rapidus is confident that it is on track to mass produce 2nm chips by 2027. The challenge will be achieving the yield and quality that is needed to survive in an incredibly competitive market – the very areas where Taiwan and South Korea have pulled ahead.TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.In a 2024 report, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office highlighted that although Rapidus is receiving government subsidies and consortium members are contributing funds: "The financing falls short of the expected 5 trillion yen ($31.8bn; £24.4bn) needed to start mass production."The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: "Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung)."Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.Nevertheless, Japan's government is pouring money into the chip industry - $27bn between 2020 and early 2024 - a larger commitment relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) than the US made through the Biden-era CHIPS Act.In late 2024, Tokyo unveiled a $65bn package for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors that could further support Rapidus's expansion plans.This comes after decades of decline. Forty years ago Japan made more than half of the world's semiconductors. Today, it produces just over 10%.Many point to US-Japan trade tensions in the 1980s as a turning point.Naoyuki Yoshino, professor emeritus at Keio University, said Japan lost out in the technology stakes to Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s, leaving domestic companies weaker.Unlike its rivals, Japan failed to sustain subsidies to keep its chipmakers competitive.But Mr Koike says that mentality has changed."The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again."Japan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.Japan also faces a severe shortage of semiconductor engineers – an estimated 40,000 people in the coming years.Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.The government's push is already attracting major global players.TSMC is producing 12–28nm chips in Kumamoto, on the south-western island of Kyushu - a significant step for Japan, even if it lags behind the company's cutting-edge production in Taiwan. The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments. Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a "fab", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow. TSMC started building a second plant on Kyushu in October this year, which is due to begin production by the end of 2027. Beyond Rapidus and TSMC, local players like Kioxia and Toshiba are also getting government backing.Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.American memory chipmaker Micron will also receive $3.63bn in subsidies from the Japanese government to grow facilities in Hiroshima, while Samsung is building a research and development facility in Yokohama.Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there."This will make a form of 'global ecosystem'," Mr Koike says, "where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world."Mr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players."TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race," Mr Koike said.Global demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers -  still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers."We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value," Mr Koike said.For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Cloudflare outage might be a good thing</title><link>https://gist.github.com/jbreckmckye/32587f2907e473dd06d68b0362fb0048</link><author>radeeyate</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 03:04:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Stun LLMs with thousands of invisible Unicode characters</title><link>https://gibberifier.com/</link><author>wdpatti</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 03:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Doesn't understand gibberified text - responds with confusion or completely ignores the invisible characters.See ChatGPT → Gemini can't process the invisible characters.See Gemini → Crashes or errors when encountering gibberified text - cannot process the Unicode obfuscation.Meta AI Crashes ⚠️ Completely bewildered by gibberified text - has no idea what's happening with the invisible characters.See Grok → Gets confused by the invisible Unicode characters and produces garbled or incomplete responses.See Perplexity →]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John F.

I’ve just closed my 12th bug of the week. My brain is completely fried. And I’m staring at the bug leaderboard, genuinely sad that Monday means going back to regular work. Which is weird because I  regular work. But fixit weeks have a special place in my heart.Once a quarter or so, my org with ~45 software engineers stops all regular work for a week. That means no roadmap work, no design work, no meetings or standups.Instead, we fix the small things that have been annoying us and our users:an error message that’s been unclear for two yearsa weird glitch when the user scrolls and zooms at the same timea test which runs slower than it should, slowing down CI for everyoneThe rules are simple: 1) no bug should take over 2 days and 2) all work should focus on either small end-user bugs/features or developer productivity.We also have a “points system” for bugs and a leaderboard showing how many points people have. And there’s a promise of t-shirts for various achievements: first bug fix, most points, most annoying bug, etc. It’s a simple structure, but it works surprisingly well.Some stats from this fixit:4 was the median number of bugs closed per person12 was maximum number of bugs closed by one personHere are some of the highlights (sadly many people in my org work in internal-facing things so I cannot share their work!):I closed a feature request from 2021! It’s a classic fixit issue: a small improvement that never bubbled to the priority list. It took me  to implement. One day for something that sat there for . And it’s going to provide a small but significant boost to every user’s experience of Perfetto.My colleague made this small change to improve team productivity. Just ~25 lines of code in a GitHub Action to avoid every UI developer taking two extra clicks to open the CI’s build. The response from the team speaks for itself:I also fixed this issue to provide a new “amalgamated” version of our SDK, allowing it to be easily integrated into projects. It’s one of those things that might be the difference between someone deciding to use us or not, but building it took just one hour of work (with liberal use of AI!).For the product: craftsmanship and careI care deeply about any product I work on. That means asking big questions like “what should we build?” and “how do we make this fast?” But it also means asking smaller questions: “is this error message actually helpful?” or “would I be frustrated using this?”A hallmark of any good product is attention to detail: a sense that someone has thought things through, and the pieces fit together to make a cohesive whole. And the opposite is true: a product with rough edges might be tolerated if there are no alternatives, but there will always be a sense of frustration and “I wish I could use something else”.Fixits are a great chance to work on exactly those details that separate good products from great ones. The small things your average user might not consciously notice, but absolutely will notice if they’re wrong.For the individual: doing, not thinkingI sometimes miss the feeling I had earlier in my career when I got to just fix things. See something broken, fix it, ship it the same day.The more senior you get in a big company, the less you do that. Most of your time becomes thinking about what to build next, planning quarters ahead, navigating tradeoffs and getting alignment.Fixits give me that early-career feeling back. You see the bug, you fix it, you ship it, you close it, you move on. There’s something deeply satisfying about work where the question isn’t “what should we do?” but rather “can I make this better?” And you get to answer that question multiple times in a week.For the team: morale and spiritHaving 40 people across two time zones all fixing bugs together adds a whole other dimension.The vibe of the office is different: normally we’re all heads-down on different projects, but during fixit the team spirit comes out strong. People share their bug fixes in chat rooms, post before-and-after screenshots and gather around monitors to demo a new feature or complain about a particularly nasty bug they’re wrestling.The leaderboard amplifies this energy. There’s a friendly sense of competition as people try and balance quick wins with meatier bugs they can share stories about.There’s also a short update every morning about how the previous day went:how many people have fixed at least one bughow many different products we’ve fixed things inwho’s currently at the top of the leaderboardAll of this creates real momentum, and people feel magnetically pulled into the effort.I’ve participated in 6 fixits over the years and I’ve learned a lot about what makes them successful. Here are a few things that matter more than you’d think.Most of what makes a fixit work happens before the week even starts.All year round, we encourage everyone to tag bugs as “good fixit candidates” as they encounter them. Then the week before fixit, each subteam goes through these bugs and sizes them:small (less than half a day)large (less than 2 days).They assign points accordingly: 1, 2, or 4.We also create a shortlist of high-priority bugs we really want fixed. People start there and move to the full list once those are done. This pre-work is critical: it prevents wasting day one with people aimlessly searching for bugs to fix.In one of our early fixits, someone picked up what looked like a straightforward bug. It should have been a few hours, maybe half a day. But it turned into a rabbit hole. Dependencies on other systems, unexpected edge cases, code that hadn’t been touched in years.They spent the entire fixit week on it. And then the entire week after fixit trying to finish it. What started as a bug fix turned into a mini project.
The work was valuable! But they missed the whole point of a fixit. No closing bugs throughout the week. No momentum. No dopamine hits from shipping fixes. Just one long slog.That’s why we have the 2-day hard limit now. If something is ballooning, cut your losses. File a proper bug, move it to the backlog, pick something else. The limit isn’t about the work being worthless - it’s about keeping fixit feeling like fixit.We didn’t always do fixits with 40 people. Early on, this wasn’t an org-wide effort, just my subteam of 7 people. It worked okay: bugs got fixed and there was a sense of pride in making the product better. But it felt a bit hollow: in the bigger picture of our org, it didn’t feel like anyone else noticed or cared.At ~40 people, it feels like a critical mass that changes things significantly. The magic number is probably somewhere between 7 and 40. And it probably varies based on the team. But whatever the number is, the collective energy matters. If you’re trying this with 5 people, it might still be worth doing, but it probably won’t feel the same.The points and leaderboard are more than a gimmick, but they have to be handled carefully.Points are coarse, not precise: We deliberately use 1/2/4 points instead of trying to measure exact effort; the goal is “roughly right and fun”, not accurate performance evaluation.Celebrate breadth, not just volume. We give t-shirts for things like “first bug fix”, “most annoying bug fixed”, not just “most points”. That keeps newer or less experienced engineers engaged. A shout-out in the daily update or an internal post often matters more than the actual t-shirt.No attachment to perf reviews. This is important: fixit scores do  feed into performance reviews. The moment they do, people will start gaming it and the good vibe will die.We’ve had very little “gaming” in practice. Social norms do a good job of keeping people honest and 40 is still small enough that there’s a sense of “loyalty to the cause” from folks.The big challenge with fixits is context switching. Constantly changing what you’re working on means constantly figuring out new parts of the codebase, thinking about new problems.AI tools have mitigated this in a big way. The code they write is less important than their ability to quickly search through relevant files and summarize what needs to change. They might be right or wrong, but having that starting point really reduces the cognitive load. And sometimes (rarely) they one-shot a fix.This docs change was a perfect example of the above: an update to our docs which catches out new contributors and AI was able to one-shot the fix.On the other hand, in my record page change it was more useful for giving me prototypes of what the code should look like and I had to put in significant effort to correct the bad UX it generated and its tendency to “over-generate” code. Even so, it got me to the starting line much faster.Criticisms of fixits (and why I still like them anyway)I’ve definitely come across people who question whether fixits are actually a good idea. Some of the criticisms are fair but overall I still think it’s worth it.“Isn’t this just admitting you ignore bugs the rest of the time?”To some extent, yes, this is an admission of the fact that “papercut” bugs are underweighted in importance, both by managers and engineers. It’s all too easy to tunnel on making sure a big project is successful and easier to ignore the small annoyances for users and the team.Fixits are a way of counterbalancing that somewhat and saying “actually those bugs matter too”. That’s not to say we don’t fix important bugs during regular work; we absolutely do. But fixits recognize that there should be a place for handling the “this is slightly annoying but never quite urgent enough” class of problems.The whole reason we started fixits in the first place is that we observed these bugs never get actioned. Given this, I think carving out some explicit time for it is a good thing.“Isn’t it a waste to pause roadmap work for a whole week?”It’s definitely a tradeoff. 40 engineer-weeks is a  of manpower and there’s an argument to be made it should be used for actually solving roadmap problems.But I think this underweights the importance of polish of products to users. We’ve consistently found that the product feels noticeably better afterward (including positive comments from users about things they notice!) and there’s a sense of  in having a well-functioning product.Also, many of the team productivity fixes compound (faster tests, clearer errors, smoother workflows) so the benefits carry forward well beyond the week itself.I agree that a full week might be too much for tiny teams or startups. But you can still borrow the idea in smaller chunks: a “fixit Friday” once a month, or a 2-day mini-fixit each quarter. The core idea is the same: protected, collective time to fix the stuff people complain about but no one schedules time to address.Fixits are good for the soulThe official justification for fixits is that they improve product quality and
developer productivity. And of course they do this.But the unofficial reason I love them is simpler: it just feels good to fix things. It takes me back to a simpler time, and putting thought and attention into building great products is a big part of my ethos for how software engineering should be done. I wouldn’t want to work like that all the time. But I also wouldn’t want to work somewhere that never makes time for it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Napster Said It Raised $3 Billion From a Mystery Investor. But Now the &apos;Investor&apos; and &apos;Money&apos; Are Gone</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/11/24/022212/napster-said-it-raised-3-billion-from-a-mystery-investor-but-now-the-investor-and-money-are-gone?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 02:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shared this report from Forbes:


On November 20, at approximately 4 p.m. Eastern time, Napster held an online meeting for its shareholders; an estimated 700 of roughly 1,500 including employees, former employees and individual investors tuned in. That's when its CEO John Acunto told everyone he believed that the never-identified big investor — who the company had insisted put in $3.36 billion at a $12 billion valuation in January, which would have made it one of the year's biggest fundraises — was not going to come through. 

In an email sent out shortly after, it told existing investors that some would get a bigger percentage of the company, due to the canceled shares, and went on to describe itself as a "victim of misconduct," adding that it was "assisting law enforcement with their ongoing investigations." As for the promised tender offer, which would have allowed shareholders to cash out, that too was called off. "Since that investor was also behind the potential tender, we also no longer believe that will occur," the company wrote in the email. 

At this point it seems unlikely that getting bigger stakes in the business will make any of the investors too happy. The company had been stringing its employees and investors along for nearly a year with ever-changing promises of an impending cash infusion and chances to sell their shares in a tender offer that would change everything. In fact, it was the fourth time since 2022 they've been told they could soon cash out via a tender offer, and the fourth time the potential deal fell through. Napster spokesperson Gillian Sheldon said certain statements about the fundraise "were made in good faith based on what we understood at the time. We have since uncovered indications of misconduct that suggest the information provided to us then was not accurate." 

The article notes America's Department of Justice has launched an investigation (in which Napster is not a target), while the Securities and Exchange Commission has a separate ongoing investigation from 2022 into Napster's scrapped reverse merger. 

While Napster announced they'd been acquired for $207 million by a tech company named Infinite Reality, Forbes says that company faced "a string of lawsuits from creditors alleging unpaid bills, a federal lawsuit to enforce compliance with an SEC subpoena (now dismissed) and exaggerated claims about the extent of their partnerships with Manchester City Football Club and Google. The company also touted 'top-tier' investors who never directly invested in the firm, and its anonymous $3 billion investment that its spokesperson told Forbes in March was in "an Infinite Reality account and is available to us" and that they were 'actively leveraging' it..." 

And by the end, "Napster appears to have been scrambling to raise cash to keep the lights on, working with brokers and investment advisors including a few who had previously gotten into trouble with regulators.... If it turns out that Napster knew the fundraise wasn't happening and it benefited from misrepresenting itself to investors or acquirees, it could face much bigger problems. That's because doing so could be considered securities fraud."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask HN: Hearing aid wearers, what&apos;s hot?</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46029699</link><author>pugworthy</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 02:25:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my Phonak Audeo 90’s (RIC) died the other day after 5 years and I’m shopping for new.

They keep our egos in check. Less obvious is that they’re practical skills in the workplace, too. I think, for developers and technical leaders in particular, that the absence of ego is the best way to further our careers and do great work.In the simplest of terms the ego is the characteristic of personhood that enables us to practice self-reflection, self-awareness, and accountability for the actions or decisions we take.However, the ego also motivates us to reframe our perception of the world in whatever way keeps us centered in it. Each of us is perpetually driven to justify our place in the world. This constant self-justification is like an engine that idles for our entire lives, and it requires constant fine-tuning. When it runs amok this is what we call a “big” ego.Breaking News! Developers Have Egos!I’m not thinking only of the 10x engineer stereotype, although I’ve worked with such folks in the past. Ego is more nuanced than that. Besides the most arrogant developer in the room throwing their weight around, our egos manifest in hundreds of ways that are much harder to detect.As developers we’re more susceptible to letting our egos run free. The nature of our work is so technical that to others it can seem obscure, arcane, or even magical. Sometimes we don’t do enough to actively dispel that notion—and just like that half the work of self-justification is already done for us.Very often it’s not intentional. The simplest example is the overuse of jargon and acronyms. We all do it, but as Jeremy Keith explains:Still, I get why initialisms run rampant in technical discussions. You can be sure that most discussions of particle physics would be incomprehensible to outsiders, not necessarily because of the concepts, but because of the terminology.Simply mashing a few letters together can be empowering for ourselves while being exclusionary for others. It’s an artifact—albeit a small one—of our egos. We know what the technobabble means. Our justified place in the universe is maintained.Sometimes we express our egos more deliberately. Developers have a clear tendency towards gatekeeping. For most, it’s an honest mistake. There’s a fine line between holding others to a certain expectation versus actively keeping people on the outside. When we see ourselves doing this we can correct it easily enough.Sadly there are developers who seemingly like to gatekeep. They get to feel like wizards in their towers with their dusty books and potions. But, it’s actually self-limiting. Gatekeeping by definition means you’re fixed in place and never moving, standing guard for eternity.My point is our egos can “leak” in so many ways that it takes diligence to catch it let alone correct it. The following is a short, incomplete list of typical statements we as developers might say or hear at work. If you parse them more precisely each one is an attempt at self-justification:“That’s the way we’ve always done it.”“It’s not that complicated! You just…”“Yeah, I should be able to finish this in a day.”“This legacy codebase is an absolute disaster.”“Assign it to me. Nobody else will be able to fix it.”“You can’t be a senior dev. You don’t know anything about…”“Ugh, our morning standup is so useless.”“This feature is too important to assign to the junior dev.”“We should start using this new tool in our pipeline.”“We should never use that new tool in our pipeline.”Everything Is Bigger Than YouThe ego is concerned with the self but very easily becomes something harmful in the absence of new information or context. Indeed, the ego nudges us to self-justify so much that one could argue it actively  new information when left unchecked.You may have read one of the example statements above with some familiarity and thought, “But what if I’m right?”To which I’d say: OK, but should that be your default stance? Why might you feel the need to immediately start a conversation with a self-justification? There are ways to adjust our approach, make our points, and accept new information all at the same time.In any interaction—be it a meeting, Slack thread, or water cooler conversation—we must remember that the matter at hand is bigger than us in ways we don’t yet understand.To make these concepts more actionable I find it simpler to define them in terms of the purposes they serve. Specifically…Empathy is how we .Humility is how we allow information to change our behavior.This framing also helps remind us what empathy and humility . It’s not about putting yourself in another’s shoes, as the saying goes. It’s not about being submissive or a pushover. It’s not about altruism or self-sacrifice. We can easily practice empathy and humility without it ever being at our own expense.The Pursuit Of InformationI don’t know about you but I go to work to solve problems, be creative, and build shit. I can’t think of a single instance where an unruly ego solved anything I’ve worked on. Ego just makes an existing challenge worse. Solutions require information I don’t have yet.Empathy and humility are usually top of mind during situations of pain or distress, but they’re really aspects of emotional intelligence that should be activated at all times. Once you adjust your mindset to treat them as basic tools for the  you’ll see opportunities to leverage them everywhere.Developers can apply this mindset with almost anybody they come into contact with. Fellow developers, naturally. But also less technical teammates (e.g., QAs, designers, product owners, stakeholders) who have their own unique skills and context that our success depends on. And of course our users should be at the center of every problem we’re working to solve. Lastly, even executives and upper management have some insight to offer if you dare (but only up to a certain point).“Be Curious, Not Judgmental”I’ve been waiting years for a chance to work Ted Lasso into one of my essays. Today’s the day, readers.The titular character is such an archetype for leadership that my jaw hit the floor when I first watched the show. The example Ted sets has spawned countless think pieces about leadership and management. Suffice it to say he exhibits all of my principles over the series’ 34 episodes. He’s empathy and humility sporting a mustache. He’s the absence of ego personified.I highly recommend watching the show but to get a taste this 5 minute clip is worth your time. This is the famous “darts scene”…There’s a common and derisive attitude that qualities like empathy or humility are signs of weakness. You have to get all up in your feelings. Ew! But they require enormous reserves of strength, patience, and determination. It’s those who follow their egos who are weak.Letting your ego take control is the easiest thing in the world. Just ask any toddler throwing a temper tantrum. Resisting those impulses and remaining calm, on the other hand, has been a virtue humanity has aspired to for thousands of years. As the Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius wrote: “The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”You’re Neither Ted Lasso Nor A Roman EmperorThe practice of empathy, humility, and keeping your ego in check will . The feedback I’ve received the most from my coworkers is that I’m extraordinarily calm and even-keeled in any situation—even situations where I’d be right to freak out.Is that just naturally my personality? Maybe in part, but remaining calm is a choice. I’m actively choosing to favor solutions over my own ego. To my colleagues past and present I confess to you now that any time you’ve seen me calm, cool, and collected I was very likely .If this sounds like a lot of work you might be wondering if it’s worth it. I think it is. At the very least your coworkers and colleagues will like you better. That’s no small thing.In all seriousness, the positive feedback I get most about the developers I manage is when they’ve demonstrated empathy and humility while dialing back their egos. This is because they’re people we can work with—literally. Nobody wants to work with a narcissist or a rock star. Nobody is materially impressed by how many lines of code we wrote, or how fast we wrote it.When people want to work with us—or even look forward to it—that means we have trust and respect. We’ll be on proper footing for working effectively as a group to solve problems. For developers this looks like coaching a junior developer, hopping on a quick call to pair with somebody, or understanding the business value of the next backlog item. For leaders this looks like people who feel empowered to do their work, who can proactively identify issues, or who can rally and adapt when circumstances change.Anybody can do this! I can’t think of any other career advice that’s as universal as empathy and humility. Everybody is capable of, at any point in their lives, small yet impactful improvements.So remember—watch your ego and look for opportunities to leverage empathy and humility in the pursuit of information so that you can solve problems together.In my next essay on this subject I’ll get into the practical. What I like about this advice is that, while there’s much we can do, we don’t have to do it all to see some benefit. We can pick and choose and try something out. We can take your time and grow. Nobody’s perfect, not even Ted Lasso. Even if we take after a character like Roy Kent we can still call that a win. Just watch the show, OK?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can India compete when it comes to chips? #tech</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/372FW2E2R6I</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/372FW2E2R6I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 01:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By 2032, India will be on par with other chip-making nations, says Ashwini Vaishnaw, India's IT and Railways Minister.

 WhatsApp 32% 

 Reddit 26% 

 Snapchat 25% 

 X.com (formerly Twitter) 21% 

 Threads 8% 

 Bluesky 4% 

 Truth Social 3% 

 

An announcement from Pew Research adds some trends and demographics:




The Center has long tracked use of many of these platforms. Over the past few years, four of them have grown in overall use among U.S. adults — TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp and Reddit. 37% of U.S. adults report using TikTok, which is slightly up from last year and up from 21% in 2021. Half of U.S. adults now report using Instagram, which is on par with last year but up from 40% in 2021. About a third say they use WhatsApp, up from 23% in 2021. And 26% today report using Reddit, compared with 18% four years ago. 

While YouTube and Facebook continue to sit at the top, the shares of Americans who report using them have remained relatively stable in recent years... YouTube and Facebook are the only sites asked about that a majority in all age groups use, though for YouTube, the youngest adults are still the most likely to do so. This differs from Facebook, where 30- to 49-year-olds most commonly say they use it (80%). 

Other interesting statistics:

"More than half of women report using Instagram (55%), compared with under half of men (44%). Alternatively, men are more likely to report using platforms such as X and Reddit."




"Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to report using WhatsApp, Reddit, TikTok, Bluesky and Threads."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Doge &apos;doesn&apos;t exist&apos; with eight months left on its charter</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-doesnt-exist-with-eight-months-left-its-charter-2025-11-23/</link><author>the_mitsuhiko</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:05:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>620.

These fuzzy, diminutive creatures, complete with a stare some have described as demonic, became truly inescapable over this past summer. Everywhere I turned, from the airport to the mall to the bathroom at my below-minimum-wage job, Labubus followed, staring at me ominously from backpacks and keychains.Labubus began innocently enough, originating in 2015 from a picture book series by Kasing Lung before they were made into toys. However, after slowly gaining traction throughout 2024 and early 2025, Labubus exploded in popularity over the summer, flying off store shelves around the world. Resale prices skyrocketed as demand rose and they became harder to come across, to the point where some people instead opted to knowingly shell out money to buy fake Labubus, affectionately referred to as “Lafufus.” This traction, however, was short-lived. While in the summer you might have had to spend $200 on a Labubu you could get your hands on one, today I scroll my feed and find microinfluencers promoting genuineLabubus for $30 on TikTok Shop. They’re just not hard to find anymore. Combined with the fact that the stock price of Pop Mart — the company behind Labubus — is down nearly 35% (at the time of writing) since its peak in August 2025, it’s clear that Labubus are on the downswing. Of course, Labubus are not alone in this fall from grace; fads have always come and gone. However, for as prominent as Labubus became, they seem to have faded from popular culture abnormally fast — even for a fad. Although it might seem anomalous, a clear pattern emerges when analyzing Labubus and the other massive trends that have appeared out of nowhere as of late. In an era when people are more connected with each other via the internet and social media, trends can gain greater prevalence than ever, faster than ever. Simultaneously, in the era when most internet users consume more short-form content than anything else, our attention spans are shorter than ever, causing these trends to seemingly drop off the face of the Earth once people get bored of them.Because of this, the internet has become a tapestry of many different digital phenomena, all so massive that they define the culture while they’re around, only to evacuate our minds as quickly as they appeared when it’s time to make room for the next trend. There’s no longer one single, massive cultural moment that sticks around for years in the vein of “Gangnam Style” or slime or fidget spinners. Instead, trends from various corners of the internet coalesce into one, and we get a mush of whatever “Labubu Dubai chocolate ‘Love Island’ matchaBenson Boone moonbeam ice cream cookie” is supposed to be. It’s a complete mess.And yet, as cringeworthy as the modern internet may be, it will never go back to the way it was before. The reality is that the internet has become decentralized; rather than people staying in one gigantic, unified group with shared trends and moments like they used to, users go their separate ways, with social media algorithms providing hyper-curated content that pushes users toward smaller groups with niche shared interests. It is from all of these individual, smaller communities that the many different trends we see today seem to merge into one.But maybe this — the mess, the chaos, the mishmash — is a unifying cultural moment after all, just in a new form. The beauty of the internet has always been that people from so many different places and backgrounds are able to come together and interact with one another, so it only makes sense that our trends would follow the same pattern. Looking back on the big trends of the past, I’ve realized it’s unrealistic for everyone to come together and enjoy the same thing, especially when we constantly preach individualism and influencers push us to be ourselves. For the most part, the internet trends of before were not truly unifying; they were just bandwagons we all hopped onto for fear of missing out.But now, in this new wave of internet trends, nobody has to miss out. We are free to enjoy what we want to enjoy while experiencing the trends and culture from sides of the internet we might have never ventured into otherwise. It’s not everyone being the same that brings us together, but rather the exchange of culture, information, interests and everything in-between that is facilitated by the internet. Labubus themselves are an example of this — despite initially only being prominent in China (where Pop Mart is headquartered), small interactions between internet users from there and the rest of the world allowed the culture barrier between them to be breached, eventually making Labubus a global phenomenon, even if only for a little while.The decentralization of the internet and its trends has allowed the web to become a more unified, multicultural place — and it’s beautiful. Even if it’s a jumble, I will gladly take all of the “Labubu Dubai chocolate ‘Love Island’matcha Benson Boone moonbeam ice cream cookie” summers that the internet has to offer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Was the Moon-Forming Protoplanet &apos;Theia&apos; a Neighbor of Earth?</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/2327252/was-the-moon-forming-protoplanet-theia-a-neighbor-of-earth?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Theia crashed into earth and formed the moon, the theory goes. But then where did Theia come from? The lead author on a new study says "The most convincing scenario is that most of the building blocks of Earth and Theia originated in the inner Solar System. Earth and Theia are likely to have been neighbors." 

Though Theia was completely destroyed in the collision, scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research led a team that was able to measure the ratio of tell-tale isotopes in Earth and Moon rocks, Euronews explains:



The research team used rocks collected on Earth and samples brought back from the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts to examine their isotopes. These isotopes act like chemical fingerprints. Scientists already knew that Earth and Moon rocks are almost identical in their metal isotope ratios. That similarity, however, has made it hard to learn much about Theia, because it has been difficult to separate material from early Earth and material from the impactor. 

The new research attempts a kind of planetary reverse engineering. By examining isotopes of iron, chromium, zirconium and molybdenum, the team modelled hundreds of possible scenarios for the early Earth and Theia, testing which combinations could produce the isotope signatures seen today. Because materials closer to the Sun formed under different temperatures and conditions than those further out, those isotopes exist in slightly different patterns in different regions of the Solar System. 

By comparing these patterns, researchers concluded that Theia most likely originated in the inner Solar System, even closer to the Sun than the early Earth.

 

The team published their findings in the journal Science. Its title? "The Moon-forming impactor Theia originated from the inner Solar System."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>X&apos;s new country-of-origin feature reveals many &apos;US&apos; accounts to be foreign-run</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/xs-new-country-of-origin-feature-shakes-maga-and-democrat-circles-as-many-us-accounts-revealed-to-be-foreignrun-101763857104296.html</link><author>ourmandave</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 23:25:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, has introduced the country of origin feature that seems to have thrown both the MAGA and Democrats' worlds online into chaos. Several profiles online, that had pushed certain narratives are now being found to have been operating from outside the US.The social media platform introduced a feature where one can see the country the account is based in. One has to head to an account and click on the date joined tab, which opens up onto a new page. This shows the country where that particular account is being operated from. While the feature was briefly removed after its introduction, it has now been added again, and both sides of the political spectrum are having a field day, calling out each other online.What to know about ‘American’ accounts based out of USThe accounts being discussed here have pushed agendas within the US, and commented on US politics regularly. Many are also named to echo political movements, like some MAGA accounts.However, these ‘political influencers’ have been found to be based outside the US, raising questions about the motives.One profile going by 'MAGA NATION' with a follower count of over 392,000, is based out of eastern Europe. Similarly, ‘Dark Maga’ a page with over 15,000 followers is based out of Thailand. ‘MAGA Scope’ which boasts over 51,000 followers is actually operated out of Nigeria, and ‘America First’, an account with over 67,000 followers is based out of Bangladesh.“At this time thousands of MAGA-aligned influencer accounts and large political pages that claim to be based in the U.S. are now being investigated and exposed with many of them traced to India, Nigeria, and other countries,” a news aggregator page on X noted.It wasn't just on the MAGA side. An account going by ‘Ron Smith’ whose bio claims he's a ‘Proud Democrat’ and ‘Professional MAGA hunter’ is operated out of Kenya. The account has over 52,000 followers.‘Republicans against Trump’ an anti-Donald Trump page on X, which tries to push politics against MAGA, was reportedly operating out of Austria. While the location now shows US, X notes that the account location might not be accurate due to use of VPN. “The Anti-Trump account “Republicans Against Trump” which 1M followed has been identified as a non-American from Austria and is currently using a VPN to hide their location,” a page said, making note of this.‘Republicans against Trump’ has over 978,000 followers.On a side note, an account going by ‘Mariana Times’, with over 78,000 followers, which posts pro-Israel content has been found to be based out of India. People within the MAGA orbit have also reacted to this new feature. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna wrote on X from her personal account, “All of these pretend “pro-America” accounts that were pushing infighting within Maga are literally foreign grifters. I’m telling you, the foreign opp is real and so are the bot accounts.” Alexis Wilkins, FBI director Kash Patel's girlfriend, also added, “I hope that everyone sees, regardless of their specific reason, that the enemy is outside of the house. The people posing as Americans with big American opinions but are actually operating from a basement across the world have one common goal - to destroy the United States. We have our issues, but we really can’t allow them to succeed.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.18-rc7 Released With Late Hardware Improvements</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.18-rc7-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 23:03:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux 6.18-rc7 just arrived in the Git tree as the newest weekly test build leading up to Linux 6.18 stable hopefully debuting next Sunday, 30 November...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wayland Protocols 1.46 Released With New Experimental Additions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wayland-Protocols-1.46</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 22:55:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Wayland Protocols 1.46 released this evening with new experimental protocols for text improvements as well as refinements to the color management protocol for HDR...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I wrote a minimal memory allocator in C</title><link>https://github.com/t9nzin/memory</link><author>t9nzin</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 22:25:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A fun toy memory allocator (not thread safe, that's a future TODO).

Bernstein alleged that America's National Security
Agency (and its UK counterpart GCHQ) were attempting to influence NIST to adopt weaker post-quantum cryptography
standards without a "hybrid" approach that would've also included pre-quantum ECC. 

Bernstein is of the opinion that "Given how
many post-quantum proposals have been broken and the continuing flood of side-channel attacks, any competent engineering evaluation will conclude that
the best way to deploy post-quantum [PQ] encryption for TLS, and for the Internet more broadly, is as double encryption: post-quantum cryptography on top of ECC." But
he says he's seen it playing out differently:


By 2013, NSA had a quarter-billion-dollar-a-year
budget to "covertly influence and/or overtly leverage"
systems to "make the systems in question exploitable"; in
particular, to "influence policies, standards and specification
for commercial public key technologies". NSA is quietly
using stronger cryptography for the data it cares about, but
meanwhile is spending money to promote a market for weakened
cryptography, the same way that it successfully created decades of
security failures by building up the market for, e.g., 40-bit
RC4 and 512-bit
RSA and Dual EC.
 I looked concretely at what was happening in IETF's
TLS working group, compared to the consensus
requirements for standards-development organizations. I reviewed
how a call for "adoption" of an NSA-driven specification produced a variety of objections that weren't
handled properly. ("Adoption" is a preliminary step before IETF standardization....) On 5 November 2025, the chairs issued "last call" for objections to publication of the document. The deadline for input is "2025-11-26", this coming Wednesday. 


Bernstein also shares concerns about how the Internet Engineering Task Force is handling the discussion, and argues that the document is even "out of scope" for the
IETF TLS working group

This document doesn't serve any of the official goals in the TLS working group charter. Most importantly, this document is directly contrary to the "improve security" goal, so it would violate the charter even if it contributed to another goal... Half of the PQ proposals submitted to NIST in 2017 have been broken already... often with attacks having sufficiently low cost to demonstrate on
readily available computer equipment. Further PQ software has been broken by implementation issues such as side-channel attacks. 

He's also concerned about how that discussion is being handled:

On 17 October 2025, they posted a "Notice of Moderation for Postings by D. J. Bernstein" saying that they would "moderate the postings of D. J. Bernstein for 30 days due to disruptive behavior effective immediately" and specifically that my postings "will be held for moderation and after confirmation by the TLS Chairs of being on topic and not disruptive, will be released to the list"... 


I didn't send anything to the IETF TLS mailing list for 30 days after that. Yesterday [November 22nd] I finished writing up my new objection and sent that in. And, gee, after more than 24 hours it still hasn't appeared... Presumably the chairs "forgot" to flip the censorship button off after 30 days.

There are many reasons to hate C++, and I hate C++ too. Lots of people were waiting for a better programming language, but got Rust instead.There are several core problems with Rust:Its compilation is slow. I mean SLOW. Slower than C++.  I know over years Rust became several times faster, but objectively we need it to be two orders of magnitude faster, not just two times.It’s complex. Just as complex as C++. But C++ had legacy and Rust had not. The complexity of forcing your way through the jungle of  on every single step directly impacts the quality of the logic being implemented i.e. you can’t see the forest for the trees. Once again, C++ has the same problem, so what’s the point of the language switch in the end?Memory safety is not that sacred. In fact, for many applications malfunctioning is better than crashing — particulary in the embedded world where Rust wants to be present. You cannot get 99.999% reliability with Rust — it crashes all the time.When handling lots of mutable shared state (GUI, DB, stateful services, OS/hardware), the performance of native Rust memory model is subpar, and non-native unsafes just leave you with slow compilation, high complexity, and no memory safety in the end — which makes Rust practically meaningless for heavy mutable state jobs.There is no doubt about it. Undefined behavior (UB) is a fundamental aspec of the language, you don’t simply encounter UB — the whole language is built on UB. You do array indexing and you immediately encounter UB because the language just does not check out of bound access. I want to emphasize that lots of UB-s are not even justified by performance matters — it’s an outright sloppy design of C carried over and amplified in C++. I can go all day long about how C++ sucks:implicit type conversions, implicit copies, implicit constructors, implicit object slicing, and pretty much everything implicit;function overloading (implicit), particulary considering its omnipresence in STL;non-uniform error handling with exceptions as afterthought;still #include-ing text files 40 years after C and One Definition Rule barely checked by compilers;unsound combination of paradigms (good luck overriding a generic function in descendant classes);SFINAE nuisance as a core mechanism of generic programming;T, T&, T*, std::optionalSo C++ is complex, unsafe, and it’s compiler is slow. How does the Rust (not) fix those issues?Rust FAQ explains that there are many efforts to optimize it, like better frontend, MIR, and so on. But MIR effort was started at 2015 and it still fails to significantly quicken the compilation (although it speeds up compiler checks).Unfortunately, it’s impossible to make Rust compile fast. The problem is inherent to all similar generics-heavy languages, like Haskell. Arguably, Rust is closer to Haskell than it is to C++. You can also say it’s close to a template-heavy C++ — and template-heavy C++ code exhibits the same problem of slow compilation.
When you do  — you don’t just iterate, you create a range, you create an iterator, you iterate over it — all of it monomorphized to your concrete types and have to be optimized individually (non-optimized Rust code is insanely slow, it’s mostly unusable even for debugging).
Put a non-optional borrow-checker on top of it — and there you have your insanely slow compiler. And you WILL recompile a lot, because borrow checker is relentless.You just cannot avoid it. You cannot go along like “I’m writing a cold path high-level code, I don’t need performance, I don’t need to go deeper into lifetime handling, I just want to write a high level logic”. You will be forced into the low level nuances every time you write a single line of Rust. There is no garbage collector for Rust and will never be — you will have to semi-manually pack all your data into a tree of ownership. You have to be fluent in ownership, borrowing, traits to write just a few lines of code.As I’ve already mentioned, this makes it very hard to write high-level logic in Rust. That’s why many of early Rust adopters actually revert to Node.js and Go for less performance-sensitive services — high complexity combined with slow compilation makes it impractical to write anything complex in sole Rust.There are two uncompromising things in the Rust fundament: performance and memory safety. I have to argue that Rust designers went wa-a-ay overboard with memory safety. You know the containers are actually implemented with  functions, because there is just no perfect correctness possible in the Turing machine model — you have to build safe programs from carefully arranged unsafe building blocks. Node.js and Go are considered practically safe language. Rust sacrificed sanity and practicality for memory safety — and gets none of them at the end of the day, it’s still not 100% memory safe.Now speaking about practicality — lots of use cases just don’t need perfect memory safety. There are ways to implement unsafe programs that still don’t execute remote code or leak secret — they only corrupt user data and act sporadically. If a pacemaker stops — telling a victim “but the memory was not corrupted in the crash” is a weak consolation. We actually had a recent Cloudflare outage caused by a crash on  function:https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/It’s probably the strongest point of my whining: Rust is memory safe and unreliable. The price of memory safety was reliability in addition to the developer’s sanity ­— that’s why I’m telling the language designers went overboard. They sacrificied core practical quality for an abstract principle of memory safety. Just like Haskell designers sacrificed practicality for purity — that’s why I reiterate on parallels between Rust and Haskell.It’s possible, but employing mutable shared state in Rust just makes no sense. You lose most of advantages and are left with all the deficiencies of Rust. Pretty much all of the successful Rust projects are employing shared read-only state, one way data flow, acyclic data structures: rustc compiler, mdbook and pulldown-cmark Markdown tools, Actix and Axum for stateless handlers, append-only blockchains, single-threaded WASM. The model is, once again, very similar to Haskell, which also excels in parsers, stateless handler, mostly-non-interactive CLI tools, and was employed in blockchains.Early prototypes of Rust actually had Software Transactional Memory (STM) as an option for safe concurrency, however, STM has performance penalties and it requires simple but significant runtime support.Step into the shared mutable state — and there a memory corruption is not an exception, it’s a rule. You have to handle the corruptions, you cannot simply crash. Borrow checker, ownership? Just useless, you cannot analyze ownership in a cyclic graph without GC-like algorithm.Sync/Send, Mutex and reference counting (Arc)? Unfortuantely, those lock or simply mess with CPU caches badly, so they are inefficient for multithreaded communication, at least an intensive one. They are safe, but inefficient. Which kinda destroys the first uncompromising thing in Rust — performance. So, to reiterate, the second you step into the shared mutable state you lose every single advantage of Rust. Which is kinda rational considering that the main concept of Rust was to never employ a shared mutable state.Particulary, GUI is a mutable shared state. Hence we don’t see any big GUI projects in Rust. Zed IDE is still beta for so many years — I can almost feel the pain of the developers hacking their way through the borrow checker jungle just to realize their logic is bug-ridden, and they are yet to implement dozens of other features.
Big databases, scalable stateful services, operating systems, at least significant Linux modules? Yet to be seen.So, is the Rust bad or good? It’s neither. It’s a mediocre programming language with thousands of man-month put into its development — this fact alone makes Rust a viable tool, just because you can pick it from the shelf and employ as-is. This blog was generated with Zola, written in Rust — I did not have to write a single line of Rust code to use it. And the Rust is a good fit for Zola SSG because of its non-interactive nature with one-way flow of immutable data. Just, please, don’t run around screaming “we should all switch our development to Rust because it’s the best programming language”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>G20 summit in South Africa wraps up | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/W0fpAl9_aSc</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W0fpAl9_aSc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 21:20:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The United States boycotted the first G20 summit held in Africa but it still dominated the agenda, with the 28-point peace plan for Ukraine stealing the spotlight as EU leaders met on the sidelines to discuss it.

whether I’m spending my time the right way
to advance my career and my life.
This is also a question that your company
asks about you every performance cycle:
is this engineering manager spending their
time effectively to advance the company or their organization?Confusingly, in my experience, answering these nominally similar questions
has surprisingly little in common.
This piece spends some time exploring both questions in the particularly
odd moment we live in today, where managers are being told they’ve
spent the last decade doing the wrong things, and need to engage
with a new model of engineering management in order to be
valued by the latest iteration of the industry.If you’d be more interested in a video version of this,
here is the recording of a practice run I gave for a talk
centered on these same ideas
(slides from talk).When I started my software career at Yahoo in the late 2000s, I had two 1:1s with my manager over the course of two
years. The first one came a few months after I started, and he mostly asked me about a colleague’s work quality.
The second came when I gave notice that I was leaving to join Digg.
A modern evaluation of this manager would be scathing, but his management style closely resembled that of the
team leader in The Soul of A New Machine:
identifying an important opportunity for the team, and navigating the broader organization that might impede progress
towards that goal.
He was, in the context we were working in, an effective manager.Compare that leadership style to the expectations of the 2010s, where attracting, retaining, and motivating engineers
was emphasized as the most important leadership criteria in many organizations.
This made sense in the era of hypergrowth, where budgets were uncapped
and many companies viewed hiring strong engineers as their constraint on growth.
This was an era where managers were explicitly told to stop writing software as the first step of their transition into management,
and it was good advice! Looking back we can argue it was bad guidance by today’s standards, but it aligned the managers with the leadership expectations
of the moment.Then think about our current era, that started in late 2022, where higher interest rates killed zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP)
and productized large language models are positioned as killing deep Engineering organizations.
We’ve flattened Engineering organizations where many roles that previously focused on coordination
are now expected to be hands-on keyboard, working deep in the details.
Once again, the best managers of the prior era–who did exactly what the industry asked them to do–are now reframed as bureaucrats
rather than integral leaders.In each of these transitions, the business environment shifted, leading to a new formulation of ideal leadership.
That makes a lot of sense: of course we want leaders to fit the necessary patterns of today.
Where things get weird is that in each case a morality tale was subsequently superimposed on top of the transition:In the 2010s, the morality tale was that it was all about empowering engineers as a fundamental good.
Sure, I can get excited for that, but I don’t really believe that narrative: it happened because hiring was competitive.In the 2020s, the morality tale is that bureaucratic middle management have made organizations stale and inefficient.
The lack of experts has crippled organizational efficiency.
Once again, I can get behind that–there’s truth here–but the much larger drivers aren’t about morality,
it’s about ZIRP-ending and optimism about productivity gains from AI tooling.The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves,
and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change,
but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing.
If you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up
to be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years,
because “good leadership” is just a fad.Self-development across leadership fadsIf you accept the argument that the specifically desired leadership skills of today
are the result of fads that frequently shift, then it leads to an important followup question:
what are the right skills to develop in to be effective today and to be impactful across fads?Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are
eight foundational engineering management skills,
which I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles
(including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence–or absence–determines
how far you can go in your career.: lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work.
Fundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you’ll neither
get an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your
teams don’t execute.: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents: shape the team and the environment such that they succeed.
This is  working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is
finding the balance between the two that works for both.: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management: navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult
Finding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else’s fault.: doing hard things, showing up when it’s uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues: build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space.
Finding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.: document and share top problems, and updates during crises: exercise discerning judgment about what “good” looks like—technically, in business terms, and in process/strategy.
Taste is a broadchurch, and my experience is that broad taste is an somewhat universal criteria for truly senior roles.
In some ways, taste is a prerequisite to Amazon’s Are Right, A Lot.: refine proposed product concept,
avoid high-risk rewrite,
find usability issues in team’s work: your team, stakeholders, and leadership know what you’re doing and why, and agree that it makes sense.
In particular, they understand how you are overcoming your biggest problems. So clarity is not, “Struggling with scalability issues”
but instead “Sharding the user logins database in a new cluster to reduce load.”: identify levers to progress,
create plan to exit a crisis,
show progress on implementing that plan: work from complex problem to opinionated, viable approach.
If you’re given an extremely messy, open-ended problem, can you still find a way to make progress?
(I’ve written previously about this topic.): launching a new business line,
improving developer experience,
going from 1 to N cloud regionsWorking across timescales: ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term.
There are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow.
Success requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.: have an explicit destination,
ensure short-term work steers towards it,
be long-term rigid and short-term flexibleHaving spent a fair amount of time pressure testing these, I’m pretty sure most effective managers, and manager archetypes, can be fit into these boxes.Self-assessing on these skillsThere’s no perfect way to measure anything complex, but here are some thinking
questions for you to spend time with as you assess where you stand on each of these skills:When did your team last have friction delivering work? Is that a recurring issue?What’s something hard you shipped that went really, really well?When were you last pulled onto solving a time-sensitive, executive-visible project?Who was the last strong performer you hired?Have you retained your strongest performers?What strong performers want to join your team?Which peers consider your team highly effective?When did an executive describe your team as exceptional?When did you or your team overcome the odds to deliver something important? (Would your stakeholders agree?)What’s the last difficult problem you solved that stayed solved (rather than reoccurring)?When did you last solve the problem first before addressing cross-team gaps?When was the last time you were surprised by a stakeholder? What could you do to prevent that reoccuring?How does a new stakeholder understand your prioritization tradeoffs (incl rationale)?When did you last disappoint a stakeholder without damaging your relationship?What stakeholders would join your company because they trust you?What’s a recent decision that is meaningfully better because you were present?If your product counterpart left, what decisions would you struggle to make?Where’s a subtle clarification that significantly changed a design or launch?How have you inflected team’s outcomes by seeing around corners?What’s a difficult trade-off you recently helped your team make?How could you enable them to make that same trade-off without your direct participation?What’s a recent decision you made that was undone? How?What problem have you worked on that was stuck before assisted, and unstuck afterwards?Do senior leaders bring ambiguous problems to you? Why?Working across timescalesWhat’s a recent trade off you made between short and long-term priorities?How do you inform these tradeoffs across timescales?What long-term goals are you protecting at significant short-term cost?Most of these questions stand on their own, but it’s worth briefly explaining
the “Have you ever been pulled into a SpecificSortOfProject by an executive?” questions.
My experience is that in most companies, executives will try to poach you onto their most
important problems that correspond to your strengths.
So if they’re never attempting to pull you in then either you’re not considered as particularly
strong on that dimensions, or you’re already very saturated with other work such that it doesn’t
seem possible to pull you in.Are “core skills” the same over time?While those groupings of “core” and “growth” skills are obvious groupings to me,
what I came to appreciate while writing this is that some skills swap between core to growth
as the fads evolve.
Where  is a foundational skill today, it was less of a core skill in the hypergrowth era,
and even less in the investor era.This is the fundamentally tricky part of succeeding as an engineering manager across fads:
you need a sufficiently broad base across each of these skills to be successful, otherwise
you’re very likely to be viewed as a weak manager when the eras unpredictably end.Stay energized to stay engagedThe “Manage your priorities and energy” chapter in
The Engineering Executive’s Primer
captures an important reality that took me too long to understand:
the perfect allocation of work is not the mathematically ideal allocation that maximizes impact.
Instead, it’s the balance between that mathematical ideal and doing
things that energize you enough to stay motivated over the long haul.
If you’re someone who loves writing software, that might involve writing a bit more than helpful to your team.
If you’re someone who loves streamlining an organization, it might be improving a friction-filled process that is a personal affront, even if it’s not causing  overall inefficiency.Similarly to the question of prioritizing activities to stay energized, there’s also understanding
where you are in your career, an idea I explored in A forty-year career.For each role, you have the chance to prioritize across different dimensions like pace, people, prestige, profit, or learning.
There’s no “right decision,” and there are always tradeoffs.
The decisions you make early in your career will compound over the following forty years.
You also have to operate within the constraints of your life today and your possible lives tomorrow.
Early in my career, I had few responsibilities to others, and had the opportunity to work extremely hard
at places like Uber. Today, with more family responsibilities, I am unwilling to make the tradeoffs to
consistently work that way, which has real implications on how I think about which roles to prioritize
over time.Recognizing these tradeoffs, and making them deliberately, is one of the highest value things you can do
to shape your career. Most importantly, it’s extremely hard to have a career at all if you don’t think about
these dimensions and have a healthy amount of self-awareness to understand the tradeoffs that will allow you
to stay engaged over half a lifetime.Published on October 26, 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mozilla Announces &apos;TABS API&apos; For Developers Building AI Agents</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/206245/mozilla-announces-tabs-api-for-developers-building-ai-agents?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 20:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Fresh from announcing it is building an AI browsing mode in Firefox and laying the groundwork for agentic interactions in the Firefox 145 release, the corp arm of Mozilla is now flexing its AI muscles in the direction of those more likely to care," writes the blog OMG Ubuntu:



If you're a developer building AI agents, you can sign up to get early access to Mozilla's TABS API, a "powerful web content extraction and transformation toolkit designed specifically for AI agent builders"... The TABS API enables devs to create agents to automate web interactions, like clicking, scrolling, searching, and submitting forms "just like a human". Real-time feedback and adaptive behaviours will, Mozilla say, offer "full control of the web, without the complexity." 




As TABS is not powered by a Mozilla-backed LLM you'll need to connect it to your choice of third-party LLM for any relevant processing... Developers get 1,000 requests monthly on the free tier, which seems reasonable for prototyping personal projects. Complex agentic workloads may require more. Though pricing is yet to be locked in, the TABS API website suggests it'll cost ~$5 per 1000 requests.
Paid plans will offer additional features too, like lower latency and, somewhat ironically, CAPTCHA solving so AI can 'prove' it's not a robot on pages gated to prevent automated activities. 



Google, OpenAI, and other major AI vendors offer their own agentic APIs. Mozilla is pitching up late, but it plans to play differently. It touts a "strong focus on data minimisation and security", with scraped data treated ephemerally — i.e., not kept. As a distinction, that matters. AI agents can be given complex online tasks that involve all sorts of personal or sensitive data being fetched and worked with.... If you're minded to make one, perhaps without a motivation to asset-strip the common good, Mozilla's TABS API look like a solid place to start.

The same goes for positioning/ordering reposts from people whom you follow, even if the option to see those reposts is turned on by default. That you don’t see those decisions as decisions doesn’t change the reality that they are, in fact, decisions made by the service as to how they’ll decide to show you content. Adding an extra algorithm is just an extra decision; it shouldn’t make a service more liable for user-generated content any more than it would be without that extra decision.I understand the impulse to want to punish Elon Musk for what he’s done to Twitter.

Here's what matters for your business.The Scale of the InvestmentBig Tech is making an unprecedented bet on AI. In 2025 alone, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon will spend approximately $400 billion on AI infrastructure; more than the entire global telecommunications industry invests annually. To put this in perspective, they've doubled their planned spending during 2025, not before it started.\
This isn't just hype. US data center construction is now overtaking office building construction, with power availability becoming the primary constraint. Some industry observers estimate the total investment could reach $3-5 trillion by 2030.\
 The infrastructure is being built, whether or not clear use cases exist yet. This creates both opportunity and noise; your job is distinguishing between the two.The Product Reality CheckDespite the infrastructure surge, the product landscape tells a more nuanced story:Models Are Converging, Not DifferentiatingNew AI models launch weekly with incrementally better benchmark scores, but the top performers are increasingly close in capability. More importantly, Chinese models and open-source alternatives are rapidly catching up to Western commercial leaders. Within 12-18 months, we may see dozens of models performing at similar levels.\
 Don't build your strategy around one model provider having a sustained technical advantage. Focus instead on distribution, data, and product experience.Distribution Still Trumps TechnologyChatGPT has 800 million weekly users, but only about 5% pay for premium access. Meanwhile, survey data shows only 10-18% of US consumers use AI chatbots daily, while 45% use them at least weekly. The gap between experimentation and daily habit remains substantial.\
Google Gemini and Meta AI benefit from being embedded in existing platforms with billions of users, but haven't yet translated that distribution into a dominant market share for standalone AI interactions.\
 User adoption is real but still early. Most people are trying AI occasionally, not replacing their existing workflows. Your AI strategy should assume gradual behavior change, not instant revolution.Where Real Value Is EmergingAfter three years of experimentation, a few clear patterns have emerged:1. AI Coding: The New Abstraction LayerAI-powered coding tools represent a fundamental shift comparable to cloud computing or open-source libraries. Y Combinator reports that some startups now generate 95% of their code with AI assistance. The YC batch that launched in early 2025 showed 10% weekly growth, the fastest in the program's history.\
 Software development costs are dropping dramatically. Projects that once required large teams can now be built by small ones. Conversely, this means more competition and faster iterations from rivals.2. Content Creation at ScaleMajor consumer brands report using AI to generate 10-20x more marketing assets than before; not just faster creation of the same volume, but fundamentally more variants for testing and personalization. This includes making video production economically viable for brands that previously couldn't afford it.\
 The cost structure of marketing is changing. Testing 300 ad variants instead of 15 becomes feasible. Personalization that once required manual work can now scale. Your creative bottleneck is shifting from production to strategy.3. Customer Service AutomationAI customer service tools are seeing rapid adoption, but success requires careful deployment. The technology works well for routine inquiries but still struggles with complex situations requiring judgment.\
 Customer service automation can significantly reduce costs for high-volume, routine interactions. However, poor implementation damages brand perception quickly. Start with narrow use cases where errors have low consequences.The Critical Question: Bundle or Unbundle?This is where strategic thinking matters most. The internet unbundled physical retail—you didn't need stores in every city to reach national customers. Now, AI is potentially unbundling the internet itself.For 20 years, online recommendations have worked through correlation: "People who bought X also bought Y." This requires massive user bases generating behavioral data—creating powerful network effects and moats.\
AI potentially changes this by understanding what products  rather than just correlating purchase patterns. If someone buys packing tape, today's systems suggest boxes and bubble wrap based on past correlations. Tomorrow's AI might reason: "They're packing, so they might be moving. Perhaps they need smoke alarms for their new home, or need to update their insurance."\
 The fundamental question is whether AI can create effective recommendations without requiring millions of users. If it can, distribution advantages erode. If it can't, existing platforms become even more powerful.Where Does the Value Capture?Three years in, we still don't have clarity on whether value accrues to: (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) competing on technology (cloud providers) competing on scale and capital competing on distribution and product competing on vertical expertise\
Most likely, different layers capture value in different ways—but the balance remains uncertain.What You Should Actually Do Focus on clear use cases where AI reduces costs or increases output without requiring workflow changes:Marketing asset generation (more variants, faster)Customer service for routine inquiriesCode generation for internal toolsData analysis and reporting\
2. Experiment with Distribution. Test how AI affects your customer acquisition and recommendation engines:Can AI improve product discovery without behavioral data?What happens when customers use AI assistants to shop instead of your website?How do AI-generated ads perform compared to traditional creative?\
3. Prepare for Commodification. Assume models will become commodities within 18 months:Don't build moats around model selectionFocus on data, distribution, and customer relationshipsPrepare for competitors who can build similar products faster and cheaper chase every new model release or capability announcement. The pace of change at the model level will remain rapid, but most improvements are incremental.\
 assume current usage patterns predict final outcomes. We're still in the experimentation phase. Only 10% of Americans use AI daily, and deployment in the enterprise is even earlier.\
 panic about existential threats or revolutionary changes in the next 6-12 months. Major shifts take 5-10 years. Cloud computing launched in 2006; by 2025, it still represents only 30% of enterprise workloads.History provides perspective: When grocery barcodes and databases launched in 1974, they enabled retailers to manage 5x more SKUs. But this happened over 20+ years, not overnight.\
E-commerce has been "disrupting" retail for 25 years and still represents only 30% of US retail sales (excluding gas and groceries). The future happens, but it takes time.\
Your competitive advantage comes from:Understanding which changes happen fast (ad creation, code development) versus slow (consumer behavior, enterprise deployment)Investing in automating obvious tasks while experimenting with transformational onesBuilding on distribution and data, not model selectionMoving faster than traditional competitors while avoiding the hype cycle\
The infrastructure is being built. The technology is advancing rapidly. But the winning business models, customer behaviors, and value capture mechanisms remain unsettled. Your goal isn't to predict the final state; it's to position for multiple scenarios while capturing value from what works today.\
The companies that win will be those that automate aggressively, experiment intelligently, and remain skeptical of both the hype and the anti-hype. That's the real game.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One Company&apos;s Plan to Sink Nuclear Reactors Deep Underground</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/1850236/one-companys-plan-to-sink-nuclear-reactors-deep-underground?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:52:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long-time Slashdot reader jenningsthecat shared this article from IEEE Spectrum:

By dropping a nuclear reactor 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) underground, Deep Fission aims to use the weight of a billion tons of rock and water as a natural containment system comparable to concrete domes and cooling towers. With the fission reaction occurring far below the surface, steam can safely circulate in a closed loop to generate power. 


The California-based startup announced in October that prospective customers had signed non-binding letters of intent for 12.5 gigawatts of power involving data center developers, industrial parks, and other (mostly undisclosed) strategic partners, with initial sites under consideration in Kansas, Texas, and Utah... The company says its modular approach allows multiple 15-megawatt reactors to be clustered on a single site: A block of 10 would total 150 MW, and Deep Fission claims that larger groupings could scale to 1.5 GW. Deep Fission claims that using geological depth as containment could make nuclear energy cheaper, safer, and deployable in months at a fraction of a conventional plant's footprint... 



The company aims to finalize its reactor design and confirm the pilot site in the coming months. [Company founder Liz] Muller says the plan is to drill the borehole, lower the canister, load the fuel, and bring the reactor to criticality underground in 2026. Sites in Utah, Texas, and Kansas are among the leading candidates for the first commercial-scale projects, which could begin construction in 2027 or 2028, depending on the speed of DOE and NRC approvals. Deep Fission expects to start manufacturing components for the first unit in 2026 and does not anticipate major bottlenecks aside from typical long-lead items.

 

In short "The same oil and gas drilling techniques that reliably reach kilometer-deep wells can be adapted to host nuclear reactors..." the article points out. Their design would also streamline construction, since "Locating the reactors under a deep water column subjects them to roughly 160 atmospheres of pressure — the same conditions maintained inside a conventional nuclear reactor — which forms a natural seal to keep any radioactive coolant or steam contained at depth, preventing leaks from reaching the surface." 

Other interesting points from the article:


They plan on operating and controlling the reactor remotely from the surface.

Company founder Muller says if an earthquake ever disrupted the site, "you seal it off at the bottom of the borehole, plug up the borehole, and you have your waste in safe disposal."

For waste management, the company "is eyeing deep geological disposal in the very borehole systems they deploy for their reactors."


"The company claims it can cut overall costs by 70 to 80 percent compared with full-scale nuclear plants."



"Among its competition are projects like TerraPower's Natrium, notes
the tech news site Hackaday, saying TerraPower's fast neutron reactors "are already under construction and offer much more power per reactor, along with Natrium in particular also providing built-in grid-level storage. 

 "One thing is definitely for certain..." they add. "The commercial power sector in the US has stopped being mind-numbingly boring."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DW interview with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLYl2XThQM</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lXLYl2XThQM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:46:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As negotiations over a 28-point plan for Ukraine intensify, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warns of a "deep threat" to Europe’s security architecture.

It’s an interpretation of the destination displays found on some of the light rail vehicles that service the city of San Francisco. because destination displays aren’t consistently used across the city’s transit system. In fact, SF has an unusually high number of independent public transit agencies. Unlike New York, Chicago or L.A., which each have one, maybe two, San Francisco and the greater Bay Area have over two dozen. Each agency, with its own models of buses and trains, use different destination displays, creating an eclectic patchwork of typography across the city.Among them, one display in particular has always stood out to me: the LCD panel displays inside Muni’s Breda Light Rail Vehicles. I remember first noticing them on a Saturday in October on the N-Judah, heading to the Outer Sunset for a shrimp hoagie. This context is important, as anyone who’s spent an October weekend in SF knows this is the optimal vibe to really take in the beauty of the city. 
What caught my eye was how the displays look mechanical and yet distinctly personal. Constructed on a 3×5 grid, the characters are made up of geometric modules: squares, quarter-circles, and angled forms. Combined, these modules create imperfect, almost primitive letterforms, revealing a utility and charm that feels distinctly like the San Francisco I’ve come to know.
This balance of utility and charm seems to show up everywhere in San Francisco and its history. The Golden Gate’s “International Orange” started as nothing more than a rust-proof primer, yet is now the city’s defining colour. The Painted Ladies became multicoloured icons after the 1960s Colourist movement covered decades of grey paint. Even the steepness of the streets was once an oversight in city planning but has since been romanticised in films and on postcards. So perhaps it is unsurprising that I would find this same utility and charm in a place as small and functional as a train sign.
To learn more about these displays, I visited the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s (SFMTA) Electronics Shop at Balboa Park. There, technician Armando Lumbad had set up one of the signs. They each feature one large LCD panel which displays the line name, and twenty-four smaller ones to display the destination. The loose spacing of the letters and fluorescent backlighting gives the sign a raw, analogue quality. Modern LED dot-matrix displays are far more efficient and flexible, but to me, they lack the awkwardness that makes these Breda signs so delightful.
Armando showed me how the signs work. He handed me a printed matrix table listing every line and destination, each paired with a three-digit code. On route, train operators punch the code into a control panel at the back of the display, and the LCD blocks light on specific segments of the grid to build each letter. I picked code 119, and Armando entered it for me. A few seconds later the panels revealed my own stop: the N-Judah at Church & Duboce. There in the workshop, devoid of the context of the trains and the commute, the display looked almost monolithic, or sculptural, and I have since fantasised whether it would be possible to ship one of these home to Australia.
Looking inside of the display, I found labels identifying the make and model. The signs were designed and manufactured by Trans-Lite, Inc., a company based in Milford, Connecticut that specialised in transport signage from 1959 until its acquisition by the Nordic firm Teknoware in 2012. After lots of amateur detective work, and with the help from an anonymous Reddit user in a Connecticut community group, I was connected with Gary Wallberg, Senior Engineer at Trans-Lite and the person responsible for the design of these very signs back in 1999.
Learning that the alphabet came from an engineer really explains its temperament and why I was drawn to it in the first place. The signs were designed for sufficiency: fixed segments, fixed grid, and no extras. Characters were created only as destinations required them, while other characters, like the Q, X, and much of the punctuation, were never programmed into the signs. In reducing everything to its bare essentials, somehow character emerged, and it’s what inspired me to design Fran Sans.I shared some initial drawings with Dave Foster of Foster Type who encouraged me to get the font software Glyphs and turn it into my first working font. From there, I broke down the anatomy of the letters into modules, then used them like Lego to build out a full set: uppercase A–Z, numerals, core punctuation. 
Some glyphs remain unsolved in this first version, for example the standard @ symbol refuses to squeeze politely into the 3×5 logic. Lowercase remains a question for the future, and would likely mean reconsidering the grid. But, as with the displays themselves, I am judging Fran Sans as sufficient for now.
Getting up close to these signs, you’ll notice Fran Sans’ gridlines are simplified even from its real‑life muse, but my hope is that its character remains. Specifically: the N and the zero, where the unusually thick diagonals close in on the counters; and the Z and 7, whose diagonals can feel uncomfortably thin. I’ve also noticed the centre of the M can scale strangely and read like an H at small sizes, but in fairness, this type was never designed for the kind of technical detail so many monospaced fonts aim for. Throughout the process I tried to protect these unorthodox moments, because to me, they determined the success of this interpretation.
Fran Sans comes in three styles: Solid, Tile, and Panel, each building in visual complexity. The decision to include variations, particularly the Solid style, was inspired by my time working at Christopher Doyle & Co. There, we worked with Bell Shakespeare, Australia’s national theatre company dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. The equity of the Bell Shakespeare brand lies in its typography, which is a beautiful custom typeface called Hotspur, designed and produced by none other than Dave Foster.
Often, brand fonts are chosen or designed to convey a single feeling. Maybe it’s warmth and friendliness, or a sense of tech and innovation. But what I’ve always loved about the Bell typeface is how one weight could serve both Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, simply by shifting scale, spacing, or alignment. Hotspur has the gravity to carry the darkness of  and the roundness to convey the humour of . And while Fran Sans Solid is technically no Hotspur, I wanted it to share that same versatility.
Further inspiration for Fran Sans came from the Letterform Archive, the world’s leading typography archive, based in San Francisco. Librarian and archivist Kate Long Stellar thoughtfully curated a research visit filled with modular typography spanning most of the past century. On the table were two pieces that had a significant impact on Fran Sans and are now personal must-sees at the archive. First, Joan Trochut’s  “Fast Type” (1942) was created during the Second World War when resources were scarce.  gave printers the ability to draw with type, rearranging modular pieces to form letters, ornaments and even illustrations.
Second, Zuzana Licko’s process work for  (1985), an Emigre typeface, opened new ways of thinking about how ideas move between the physical and the digital and then back again. Seeing how  was documented through iterations and variations gave the typeface a depth and richness that changed my understanding of how fonts are built. At some point I want to explore physical applications for Fran Sans out of respect for its origins, since it is impossible to fully capture the display’s charm on screen.
Back at the SFMTA, Armando told me the Breda vehicles are being replaced, and with them their destination displays will be swapped for newer LED dot-matrix units that are more efficient and easier to maintain. By the end of 2025 the signs that inspired Fran Sans will disappear from the city, taking with them a small but distinctive part of the city’s voice. 
That feels like a real loss. San Francisco is always reinventing itself, yet its charm lies in how much of its history still shows through. My hope is that Fran Sans can inspire a deeper appreciation for the imperfections that give our lives and our cities character. Life is so rich when ease and efficiency are not the measure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Europe should have its own plan’ for Ukraine – former Lithuania FM</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/europe-should-have-its-own-plan-for-ukraine-former-lithuania-fm</link><author>Cathy Newman</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We spoke to Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s former foreign minister and began by asking him if the European leaders were right to tip-toe around President Trump.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says Ukraine ungrateful as officials meet to discuss peace plan</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/trump-says-ukraine-ungrateful-as-officials-meet-to-discuss-peace-plan</link><author>Harry Fawcett</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:06:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Security advisers from the US, Europe and Ukraine gathered today in Geneva to discuss ways to end the war in Ukraine, nearly four years after Russia’s full scale invasion.Within the last hour, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was making some changes to the 28-point plan after pushback from the Europeans.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COP30 talks end without roadmap for fossil fuel phase-out | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBqNZlbKIjg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KBqNZlbKIjg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The COP30 climate talks in Brazil have wrapped up, with delegates reaching a modest agreement in addressing climate change challenges.

Most implementations stop at “install Redis” and wrap a few database calls in a  closure. While functional, this barely scratches the surface of what the component can do in high-throughput, distributed environments.\
In Symfony 7.3, the Cache component is not just a key-value store; it is a sophisticated system capable of tiered architecture, probabilistic stampede protection, and transparent encryption.\
This article explores important caching strategies that solve expensive architectural problems: ,  (thundering herds),  (), and .The Architecture of Latency: Tiered (Chain) CachingIn microservice architectures or high-traffic monoliths, a network call to Redis (typically 1–3ms) can eventually become a bottleneck compared to local memory (nanoseconds). However, local memory (APCu) is volatile and doesn’t share state across pods/servers.\
The solution is a , effectively acting as an  cache for your application. , .We will configure a pool that reads from APCu first. If it misses, it reads from Redis, then populates APCu.composer require symfony/cache symfony/orm-pack redis
\
Configuration (config/packages/cache.yaml):framework:
    cache:
        # Prefix all keys to avoid collisions in shared Redis instances
        prefix_seed: '%env(APP_SECRET)%'

        pools:
            # L2 Cache: Redis (Shared)
            cache.redis:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
                provider: 'redis://%env(REDIS_HOST)%:6379'
                default_lifetime: 3600 # 1 hour

            # L1 Cache: APCu (Local Memory)
            cache.apcu:
                adapter: cache.adapter.apcu
                default_lifetime: 60 # Short TTL to prevent stale local data

            # The Chain: L1 + L2
            cache.layered:
                adapter: cache.adapter.chain
                provider: [cache.apcu, cache.redis]
Inject the specific pool using the Target attribute.namespace App\Service;

use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Attribute\Target;
use Symfony\Contracts\Cache\CacheInterface;
use Symfony\Contracts\Cache\ItemInterface;

class DashboardService
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Target('cache.layered')]
        private readonly CacheInterface $cache
    ) {}

    public function getStats(): array
    {
        // 1. Checks APCu. Hit? Return.
        // 2. Miss? Checks Redis. Hit? Populate APCu & Return.
        // 3. Miss? Run Callback. Populate Redis & APCu.
        return $this->cache->get('stats_v1', function (ItemInterface $item): array {
            $item->expiresAfter(3600);
            return $this->computeHeavyStats();
        });
    }

    private function computeHeavyStats(): array 
    { 
        // Simulation of heavy work
        return ['users' => 10500, 'revenue' => 50000]; 
    }
}
 bin/console cache:pool:clear cache.layered KEYS * (You will see the key). You will see the key.Disconnect Redis. The app will continue to serve from APCu for 60 seconds.Solving the Thundering Herd: Probabilistic Early ExpirationThe “Cache Stampede” (or Thundering Herd) occurs when a hot cache key expires. Suddenly, 1,000 concurrent requests miss the cache simultaneously and hit your database to compute the same value. The database crashes.\
Symfony solves this  complex locking mechanisms (like Semaphore) by using Probabilistic Early Expiration.Instead of expiring exactly at 12:00:00, the cache claims to be empty slightly before the expiration, but only for some requests. The closer to expiration, the higher the probability of a miss. One lucky request recomputes the value while others are served the “stale” (but valid) data.You don’t need a new configuration; you need to utilize the  parameter in the contract.// $beta of 1.0 is standard. 
// Higher = recompute earlier. 
// 0 = disable. 
// INF = force recompute.
$beta = 1.0; 

$value = $this->cache->get('stock_ticker_aapl', function (ItemInterface $item) {
    // The item ACTUALLY expires in 1 hour
    $item->expiresAfter(3600);

    return $this->stockApi->fetchPrice('AAPL');
}, $beta);
Mathematical VerificationThere is no CLI command to “prove” probability, but you can log the recomputations.Set .Create a loop that hits this cache key every 100ms.Observe that the callback is triggered before 10 seconds have passed and usually only once, ensuring your backend is protected.The “Black Box”: Transparent Encryption with SodiumCaching Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in Redis is a . If an attacker dumps your Redis memory, they have the data.\
Symfony allows you to wrap your cache adapter in a . We will use the  to transparently encrypt data before it leaves PHP and decrypt it upon retrieval.\
Ensure  is  and the extension is  in PHP 8.x.We need to decorate the default marshaller. We will use a “” marshaller (to compress data) wrapped inside a “” marshaller (to encrypt it).#config/services.yaml

services:
    # 1. Generate a key: php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(SODIUM_CRYPTO_SECRETBOX_KEYBYTES));"
    # Store this in .env.local: CACHE_DECRYPTION_KEY=your_hex_key

    # 2. Define the Marshaller Service
    app.cache.marshaller.secure:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Marshaller\SodiumMarshaller
        arguments: 
            - ['%env(hex2bin:CACHE_DECRYPTION_KEY)%']
            - '@app.cache.marshaller.deflate' # Chain encryption OVER compression

    app.cache.marshaller.deflate:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Marshaller\DeflateMarshaller
        arguments: ['@default_marshaller']

    default_marshaller:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Marshaller\DefaultMarshaller

    # 3. Use the custom marshaller in your cache adapter
    Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\RedisAdapter:
        arguments:
            $marshaller: '@app.cache.marshaller.secure'
#config/packages/cache.yaml

framework:
    cache:
        pools:
            cache.secure:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
                # We need to point the 'default_marshaller' of this pool to our secure one?
                # Actually, defining the adapter service globally as we did above 
                # is the cleanest way if you want ALL redis caches encrypted.
                # Alternatively, use the provider syntax:

                # For specific pool encryption, we often have to define the service manually 
                # or use a factory because framework.yaml config is limited for complex DI.
\
Refined Approach for Symfony (Best Practice): Instead of overriding the global adapter, define the pool service explicitly to inject the marshaller.# config/services.yaml
services:
    app.cache.secure_pool:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\RedisAdapter
        arguments:
            $redis: 'redis://%env(REDIS_HOST)%:6379'
            $marshaller: '@app.cache.marshaller.secure'
        tags: ['cache.pool']
public function storeUserAddress(int $userId, string $address): void
{
    // This data is compressed and encrypted in Redis
    $cacheItem = $this->securePool->getItem('user_addr_' . $userId);
    $cacheItem->set($address);
    $this->securePool->save($cacheItem);
}
Connect to Redis via CLI: . You will see binary garbage (encrypted string), not the plaintext address. You get the plaintext address.The hardest problem in computer science is cache invalidation. It gets harder when you have 5 web servers (pods). If Server A updates a product, Server B’s APCu cache still holds the old product.\
We solve this by broadcasting invalidation messages via Symfony Messenger.Cache locally in APCu (for speed).When data changes, dispatch a message to the bus.All servers consume the message and clear their local APCu for that specific tag.composer require symfony/messenger
\
We need a transport that supports “Pub/Sub” (Fanout), so every server gets the message. Redis streams or RabbitMQ Fanout exchanges work.#config/packages/messenger.yaml

framework:
    messenger:
        transports:
            # Use a fanout exchange so ALL pods receive the message
            cache_invalidation: 
                dsn: '%env(MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN)%'
                options:
                    exchange:
                        type: fanout
                        name: cache_invalidation_fanout
1. The Invalidation Messagenamespace App\Message;

final readonly class InvalidateTagsMessage
{
    public function __construct(
        public array $tags
    ) {}
}
\
2. The Handler This handler runs on every server.namespace App\MessageHandler;

The #[Cacheable] AttributeInstead of writing  boilerplate in every service method, let’s create a  that handles caching automatically using the  or .\
Below is a clean implementation using a Kernel::CONTROLLER_ARGUMENTS listener, which is efficient and easy to reason about.namespace App\Attribute;

use Attribute;

#[Attribute(Attribute::TARGET_METHOD)]
final readonly class Cacheable
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $pool = 'cache.app',
        public int $ttl = 3600,
        public ?string $key = null
    ) {}
}
This listener intercepts controller calls, checks for the attribute, and attempts to serve from cache.\
This simple implementation assumes the controller returns a generic serializable response (like JSON or an Array). For Response objects, serialization needs care.namespace App\EventSubscriber;

use App\Attribute\Cacheable;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Event\ControllerEvent;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\KernelEvents;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ServiceLocator;
use Symfony\Contracts\Cache\ItemInterface;

class CacheableSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private ServiceLocator $cachePools // Inject locator to find pools dynamically
    ) {}

    public static function getSubscribedEvents(): array
    {
        return [
            // High priority to catch request before execution
            KernelEvents::CONTROLLER => ['onKernelController', 10], 
        ];
    }

    public function onKernelController(ControllerEvent $event): void
    {
        $controller = $event->getController();

        // Handle array callables [$object, 'method']
        if (is_array($controller)) {
            $method = new \ReflectionMethod($controller[0], $controller[1]);
        } elseif (is_object($controller) && is_callable($controller)) {
            $method = new \ReflectionMethod($controller, '__invoke');
        } else {
            return;
        }

        $attributes = $method->getAttributes(Cacheable::class);
        if (empty($attributes)) {
            return;
        }

        /** @var Cacheable $cacheable */
        $cacheable = $attributes[0]->newInstance();

        if (!$this->cachePools->has($cacheable->pool)) {
            return;
        }

        $pool = $this->cachePools->get($cacheable->pool);

        // Generate a key based on Controller Class + Method + Request Params
        // This is a simplified key generation strategy
        $request = $event->getRequest();
        $cacheKey = $cacheable->key ?? 'ctrl_' . md5($request->getUri());

        // We cannot easily "skip" the controller execution inside a Listener 
        // using the Cache Contract pattern nicely without replacing the controller.
        // 
        // For a TRULY robust attribute implementation, one should use 
        // a "Service Decorator" logic, but for Controllers, we can replace the 
        // controller callable with a closure that wraps the cache logic.

        $originalController = $event->getController();

        $newController = function() use ($pool, $cacheKey, $cacheable, $originalController, $request) {
            return $pool->get($cacheKey, function (ItemInterface $item) use ($cacheable, $originalController, $request) {
                $item->expiresAfter($cacheable->ttl);

                // Execute the original controller
                // Note: We need to manually resolve arguments or pass the request
                // This part is tricky in raw PHP. 
                // In Symfony we can simply execute the original callable 
                // IF we have the resolved arguments.

                // SIMPLIFICATION for article:
                // Assuming controller takes Request object or no args
                return $originalController($request);
            });
        };

        $event->setController($newController);
    }
}
\
You have to  your cache pools in a  for the  to access them dynamically.\
The code above demonstrates modifying the . Ideally, for services, you would use  on the service definition, but for Controllers, intercepting the event is the Symfony way.Implementing  is easy; architecting a caching strategy that survives network partitions,  audits, and  spikes is a discipline.\
The strategies outlined here —  for latency,  for concurrency,  for security, and Messenger-based Invalidation for consistency — move your application away from fragile optimizations and toward robust engineering. Symfony provides these primitives out of the box, allowing us to solve complex distributed system problems without introducing heavy third-party infrastructure.\
Stop treating your cache as a temporary dumping ground. Treat it as a critical, secured layer of your data persistence strategy.Let’s Continue the DiscussionHigh-performance PHP architecture is a constantly evolving landscape. If you are refactoring a legacy monolith or designing a distributed system in Symfony, I’d love to hear about the challenges you are facing.\

The journey from New York City to Chicago could take just over six hours by high-speed train at an average speed of 160 mph, cutting travel time by more than 13 hours compared with the current Amtrak route... The journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles could be completed in under three hours by high-speed train... The journey from Atlanta to Orlando could be completed in under three hours by high-speed train that reaches 160 mph, cutting travel time by over half compared with driving... 



While high-speed rail remains a fantasy in the United States, it is already hugely successful across the globe. Passengers take 3 billion trips annually on more than 40,000 miles of modern high-speed railway across the globe, according to the International Union of Railways. China is home to the world's largest high-speed rail network. The 809-mile train journey from Beijing to Shanghai takes just four and a half hours... In Europe, France's Train a Grand Vitesse (TGV) is recognized as a pioneer of high-speed rail technology. Spain soon followed France's success and now hosts Europe's most extensive high-speed rail network... 

[T]rain travel contributes relatively less pollution of every type, said Jacob Mason of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, from burning less gasoline to making less noise than cars and taking up less space than freeways. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is staggering: Per kilometer traveled, the average car or a short-haul flight each emit more than 30 times the CO2 equivalent than Eurostar high-speed trains, according to data from the UK government.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are consumers just tech debt to Microsoft?</title><link>https://birchtree.me/blog/are-consumers-just-tech-debt-to-microsoft/</link><author>ingve</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:14:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m not saying this will definitely happen, but I think we could be on the cusp of a significant shift in Windows market share for consumer computers. It is not going to drop to 2% in a year or anything, but I feel like a few pieces are coming together that could move the needle in a way we have not seen in several decades. There are three things on my mind .Number one is that Microsoft just does not feel like a consumer tech company at all anymore. Yes, they have always been much more corporate than the likes of Apple or Google, but it really shows in the last few years as they seem to only have energy for AI and web services. If you are not a customer who is a major business or a developer creating the next AI-powered app, Microsoft does not seem to care about you.I just do not see excitement there. The only thing of note they have added to Windows in the last five years is Copilot, and I have yet to meet a normal human being who enjoys using it. And all the Windows 11 changes seem to have just gone over about as well as a lead balloon. I just do not think they care at all about Windows with consumers.The second thing is the affordable MacBook rumored to be coming out in 2026. This will be a meaningfully cheaper MacBook that people can purchase at price points that many Windows computers have been hovering around for many years. Considering Apple’s focus on consumers first and a price point that can get more people in the door, it seems like that could move the needle.The third thing is gamers. Gamers use Windows largely because they have to, not because they are passionate about it. Maybe they were passionate about it in the 90s, but any passion has gone away. Now it is just the operating system they use to launch Steam. In early 2026, Valve is going to release the Steam Machine after a few years of success with the Steam Deck. We will see how they do there, but what they are doing is releasing a machine that runs Windows games on Linux. And it runs them really well. The Steam Deck has proven that over the last few years. If someone can package up a version of Linux that is optimized for gamers, then I think there is a meaningful number of PC gamers who would happily run that on their computer instead.I do not know if this is going to happen. It is always easy to be cynical and suggest everything will stay the same, and I understand that markets of this size take a long time to change. However, it just feels like there are some things happening right now that are going to move the needle, and I am excited to see what happens.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine strikes Russian Shatura power plant in the Moscow region</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Go22qnyNps</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5Go22qnyNps?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:07:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukraine strikes Russian Shatura power plant in the Moscow region

The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.

Yemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.

The conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. 

A proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.

Following Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.
Between blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?

product marketing. 



Microsoft and GitHub "have launched a native integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and GitHub Advanced Security that aims to address what one executive calls decades of accumulated security debt in enterprise codebases..." according to The New Stack:

The integration, announced this week in San Francisco at the
Microsoft
Ignite 2025 conference and now available in public preview,
connects runtime intelligence from production environments directly
into developer workflows. The goal is to help organizations
prioritize which vulnerabilities actually matter and use AI to fix
them faster. "Throughout my career, I've seen vulnerability
trends going up into the right. It didn't matter how good of a
detection
engine and how accurate our detection engine was, people just
couldn't fix things fast enough," said Marcelo
Oliveira, VP of product management at GitHub, who has spent
nearly a decade in application security. "That basically resulted
in decades of accumulation of security debt into enterprise code
bases." According to industry data, critical and high-severity
vulnerabilities constitute 17.4% of security backlogs, with a mean
time to remediation of 116 days, said Andrew
Flick, senior director of developer services, languages and tools
at Microsoft, in a blog
post. Meanwhile, applications face attacks as frequently as once
every three minutes, Oliveira said. 


The integration represents the first native link between runtime
intelligence and developer workflows, said Elif
Algedik, director of product marketing for cloud and AI security
at Microsoft, in a blog
post... The problem, according to Flick, comes down to three
challenges: security teams drowning in alert fatigue while AI rapidly
introduces new threat
vectors that they have little time to understand; developers
lacking clear prioritization while remediation takes too long; and
both teams relying on separate, nonintegrated tools that make
collaboration slow and frustrating... The new integration works
bidirectionally. When Defender for Cloud detects a vulnerability in a
running workload, that runtime context flows into GitHub, showing
developers whether the vulnerability is internet-facing, handling
sensitive data or actually exposed in production. This is powered by
what GitHub calls the Virtual Registry, which creates code-to-runtime
mapping, Flick said... 

In the past, this alert would age in a dashboard while developers
worked on unrelated fixes because they didn't know this was the
critical one, he said. Now, a security campaign can be created in
GitHub, filtering for runtime risk like internet exposure or
sensitive data, notifying the developer to prioritize this issue. 


GitHub Copilot "now automatically checks dependencies, scans
for first-party code vulnerabilities and catches hardcoded secrets
before code reaches developers," the article points out — but
GitHub's VP of product management says this takes things even
further. 

"We're not only helping you fix existing vulnerabilities,
we're also reducing the number of vulnerabilities that come into
the system when the level of throughput of new code being created is
increasing dramatically with all these agentic coding agent platforms."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Calculus for Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, and Physicists [pdf]</title><link>https://mathcs.holycross.edu/~ahwang/print/calc.pdf</link><author>o4c</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:31:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>73% of AI startups are just prompt engineering</title><link>https://pub.towardsai.net/i-reverse-engineered-200-ai-startups-73-are-lying-a8610acab0d3</link><author>kllrnohj</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:17:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mount Proton Drive on Linux using rclone and systemd</title><link>https://github.com/dadtronics/protondrive-linux</link><author>cf100clunk</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:12:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Production-Ready Laravel Stack with Traefik and FrankenPHP</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/building-a-production-ready-laravel-stack-with-traefik-and-frankenphp?source=rss</link><author>Daniel, Andrei-Daniel Petrica</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:08:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Laravel boots slowly by default, but Octane and FrankenPHP cut request time dramatically by keeping the framework in memory.

I’ve just closed my 12th bug of the week. My brain is completely fried. And I’m staring at the bug leaderboard, genuinely sad that Monday means going back to regular work. Which is weird because I  regular work. But fixit weeks have a special place in my heart.Once a quarter or so, my org with ~45 software engineers stops all regular work for a week. That means no roadmap work, no design work, no meetings or standups.Instead, we fix the small things that have been annoying us and our users:an error message that’s been unclear for two yearsa weird glitch when the user scrolls and zooms at the same timea test which runs slower than it should, slowing down CI for everyoneThe rules are simple: 1) no bug should take over 2 days and 2) all work should focus on either small end-user bugs/features or developer productivity.We also have a “points system” for bugs and a leaderboard showing how many points people have. And there’s a promise of t-shirts for various achievements: first bug fix, most points, most annoying bug, etc. It’s a simple structure, but it works surprisingly well.Some stats from this fixit:4 was the median number of bugs closed per person12 was maximum number of bugs closed by one personHere are some of the highlights (sadly many people in my org work in internal-facing things so I cannot share their work!):I closed a feature request from 2021! It’s a classic fixit issue: a small improvement that never bubbled to the priority list. It took me  to implement. One day for something that sat there for . And it’s going to provide a small but significant boost to every user’s experience of Perfetto.My colleague made this small change to improve team productivity. Just ~25 lines of code in a GitHub Action to avoid every UI developer taking two extra clicks to open the CI’s build. The response from the team speaks for itself:I also fixed this issue to provide a new “amalgamated” version of our SDK, allowing it to be easily integrated into projects. It’s one of those things that might be the difference between someone deciding to use us or not, but building it took just one hour of work (with liberal use of AI!).For the product: craftsmanship and careI care deeply about any product I work on. That means asking big questions like “what should we build?” and “how do we make this fast?” But it also means asking smaller questions: “is this error message actually helpful?” or “would I be frustrated using this?”A hallmark of any good product is attention to detail: a sense that someone has thought things through, and the pieces fit together to make a cohesive whole. And the opposite is true: a product with rough edges might be tolerated if there are no alternatives, but there will always be a sense of frustration and “I wish I could use something else”.Fixits are a great chance to work on exactly those details that separate good products from great ones. The small things your average user might not consciously notice, but absolutely will notice if they’re wrong.For the individual: doing, not thinkingI sometimes miss the feeling I had earlier in my career when I got to just fix things. See something broken, fix it, ship it the same day.The more senior you get in a big company, the less you do that. Most of your time becomes thinking about what to build next, planning quarters ahead, navigating tradeoffs and getting alignment.Fixits give me that early-career feeling back. You see the bug, you fix it, you ship it, you close it, you move on. There’s something deeply satisfying about work where the question isn’t “what should we do?” but rather “can I make this better?” And you get to answer that question multiple times in a week.For the team: morale and spiritHaving 40 people across two time zones all fixing bugs together adds a whole other dimension.The vibe of the office is different: normally we’re all heads-down on different projects, but during fixit the team spirit comes out strong. People share their bug fixes in chat rooms, post before-and-after screenshots and gather around monitors to demo a new feature or complain about a particularly nasty bug they’re wrestling.The leaderboard amplifies this energy. There’s a friendly sense of competition as people try and balance quick wins with meatier bugs they can share stories about.There’s also a short update every morning about how the previous day went:how many people have fixed at least one bughow many different products we’ve fixed things inwho’s currently at the top of the leaderboardAll of this creates real momentum, and people feel magnetically pulled into the effort.I’ve participated in 6 fixits over the years and I’ve learned a lot about what makes them successful. Here are a few things that matter more than you’d think.Most of what makes a fixit work happens before the week even starts.All year round, we encourage everyone to tag bugs as “good fixit candidates” as they encounter them. Then the week before fixit, each subteam goes through these bugs and sizes them:small (less than half a day)large (less than 2 days).They assign points accordingly: 1, 2, or 4.We also create a shortlist of high-priority bugs we really want fixed. People start there and move to the full list once those are done. This pre-work is critical: it prevents wasting day one with people aimlessly searching for bugs to fix.In one of our early fixits, someone picked up what looked like a straightforward bug. It should have been a few hours, maybe half a day. But it turned into a rabbit hole. Dependencies on other systems, unexpected edge cases, code that hadn’t been touched in years.They spent the entire fixit week on it. And then the entire week after fixit trying to finish it. What started as a bug fix turned into a mini project.
The work was valuable! But they missed the whole point of a fixit. No closing bugs throughout the week. No momentum. No dopamine hits from shipping fixes. Just one long slog.That’s why we have the 2-day hard limit now. If something is ballooning, cut your losses. File a proper bug, move it to the backlog, pick something else. The limit isn’t about the work being worthless - it’s about keeping fixit feeling like fixit.We didn’t always do fixits with 40 people. Early on, this wasn’t an org-wide effort, just my subteam of 7 people. It worked okay: bugs got fixed and there was a sense of pride in making the product better. But it felt a bit hollow: in the bigger picture of our org, it didn’t feel like anyone else noticed or cared.At ~40 people, it feels like a critical mass that changes things significantly. The magic number is probably somewhere between 7 and 40. And it probably varies based on the team. But whatever the number is, the collective energy matters. If you’re trying this with 5 people, it might still be worth doing, but it probably won’t feel the same.The points and leaderboard are more than a gimmick, but they have to be handled carefully.Points are coarse, not precise: We deliberately use 1/2/4 points instead of trying to measure exact effort; the goal is “roughly right and fun”, not accurate performance evaluation.Celebrate breadth, not just volume. We give t-shirts for things like “first bug fix”, “most annoying bug fixed”, not just “most points”. That keeps newer or less experienced engineers engaged. A shout-out in the daily update or an internal post often matters more than the actual t-shirt.No attachment to perf reviews. This is important: fixit scores do  feed into performance reviews. The moment they do, people will start gaming it and the good vibe will die.We’ve had very little “gaming” in practice. Social norms do a good job of keeping people honest and 40 is still small enough that there’s a sense of “loyalty to the cause” from folks.The big challenge with fixits is context switching. Constantly changing what you’re working on means constantly figuring out new parts of the codebase, thinking about new problems.AI tools have mitigated this in a big way. The code they write is less important than their ability to quickly search through relevant files and summarize what needs to change. They might be right or wrong, but having that starting point really reduces the cognitive load. And sometimes (rarely) they one-shot a fix.This docs change was a perfect example of the above: an update to our docs which catches out new contributors and AI was able to one-shot the fix.On the other hand, in my record page change it was more useful for giving me prototypes of what the code should look like and I had to put in significant effort to correct the bad UX it generated and its tendency to “over-generate” code. Even so, it got me to the starting line much faster.Criticisms of fixits (and why I still like them anyway)I’ve definitely come across people who question whether fixits are actually a good idea. Some of the criticisms are fair but overall I still think it’s worth it.“Isn’t this just admitting you ignore bugs the rest of the time?”To some extent, yes, this is an admission of the fact that “papercut” bugs are underweighted in importance, both by managers and engineers. It’s all too easy to tunnel on making sure a big project is successful and easier to ignore the small annoyances for users and the team.Fixits are a way of counterbalancing that somewhat and saying “actually those bugs matter too”. That’s not to say we don’t fix important bugs during regular work; we absolutely do. But fixits recognize that there should be a place for handling the “this is slightly annoying but never quite urgent enough” class of problems.The whole reason we started fixits in the first place is that we observed these bugs never get actioned. Given this, I think carving out some explicit time for it is a good thing.“Isn’t it a waste to pause roadmap work for a whole week?”It’s definitely a tradeoff. 40 engineer-weeks is a  of manpower and there’s an argument to be made it should be used for actually solving roadmap problems.But I think this underweights the importance of polish of products to users. We’ve consistently found that the product feels noticeably better afterward (including positive comments from users about things they notice!) and there’s a sense of  in having a well-functioning product.Also, many of the team productivity fixes compound (faster tests, clearer errors, smoother workflows) so the benefits carry forward well beyond the week itself.I agree that a full week might be too much for tiny teams or startups. But you can still borrow the idea in smaller chunks: a “fixit Friday” once a month, or a 2-day mini-fixit each quarter. The core idea is the same: protected, collective time to fix the stuff people complain about but no one schedules time to address.Fixits are good for the soulThe official justification for fixits is that they improve product quality and
developer productivity. And of course they do this.But the unofficial reason I love them is simpler: it just feels good to fix things. It takes me back to a simpler time, and putting thought and attention into building great products is a big part of my ethos for how software engineering should be done. I wouldn’t want to work like that all the time. But I also wouldn’t want to work somewhere that never makes time for it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: Why DynamoDB Costs Explode (11/23/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/11-23-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:02:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, November 23, 2025?By @knightbat2040 [ 6 Min read ] Built an AI tool that scrapes, cleans, and summarizes Texas bills to make government legislation readable and transparent for everyone.

Imagine a person with anterograde amnesia—they can recall the distant past but are unable to form new long-term memories. In a similar way, an LLM's knowledge is static, confined to the information it learned during pre-training. When it comes to self-improvement, the human brain is the gold standard, adapting through neuroplasticity, the remarkable capacity to change its structure in response to new experiences.\
This limitation in AI leads to a critical problem known as "catastrophic forgetting." When a model is continually updated with new data, the process of learning new information often forces it to overwrite and forget old, established knowledge. It's a frustrating trade-off: gain a new skill, lose an old one.\
To solve this, Google Research has introduced "Nested Learning," a new, brain-inspired paradigm that fundamentally rethinks how AI models are built. This post breaks down the three most surprising and impactful ideas from this research, explaining how they could give AI the ability to learn continually, just like we do.1. A Model's Blueprint and Its Learning Process Aren't Separate; They're One.In traditional AI development, a model’s architecture (the structure of its neural network) and its optimization algorithm (the rules it follows to learn) are treated as two separate problems. Researchers design the network first, then figure out the best way to train it.\
Nested Learning flips this convention on its head. It proposes that the architecture and the training rules are fundamentally the same concept, differing only in their speed. The paradigm views a single AI model not as one monolithic entity, but as a system of components, each processing its own stream of information (its "context flow") at a specific "update frequency rate." An architectural component, like an attention layer, processes the flow of input tokens, while an optimizer processes the flow of error signals. Both are just learning to compress their respective context flows.\
This is a revolutionary idea because it unifies two previously distinct fields of study. By treating the model and its learning process as a single, coherent system of nested optimization problems, Nested Learning reveals a "new, previously invisible dimension for designing more capable AI."One of the most mind-bending insights from Nested Learning is that common, foundational tools in machine learning are already functioning as simple learning systems. The research shows that components like optimizers (e.g., SGD with Momentum or Adam) and even the core process of backpropagation can be reframed as "associative memory" systems.\
Associative memory is the ability to map and recall one thing based on another, like remembering a person's name when you see their face. This re-framing works because an optimizer’s core job is to compress its context flow—the history of all past error gradients - into its internal state.\
According to the research, backpropagation is a process where the model learns to map a given data point to its "Local Surprise Signal": a measure of how unexpected that information was. This isn't just an abstract concept; the paper clarifies that this "surprise" is the concrete mathematical error signal, the gradient of the loss (∇yt+1 L(Wt;xt+1)). Optimizers with momentum are essentially building a compressed memory of these surprise signals over time.\
This re-framing isn't just a theoretical exercise; it has practical implications for building better models. The researchers highlight this key finding in their paper:\
Based on NL, we show that well-known gradient-based optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc.) are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients with gradient descent.3. AI Memory Isn't a Switch; It's a Spectrum.A standard Transformer model treats memory in two distinct buckets. The attention mechanism acts as a short-term memory for immediate context, while the feedforward networks store long-term, pre-trained knowledge. Once training is complete, that long-term memory is frozen.\
Nested Learning proposes a more fluid and powerful alternative called a "Continuum Memory System" (CMS). Instead of just two types of memory, a CMS is a spectrum of memory modules, each managing a different context flow and updating at a different frequency. This is analogous to how the human brain consolidates memories over different time scales, from fleeting thoughts to deeply ingrained knowledge.\
This isn't just a new invention; it's a deeper understanding of what already works. The paper's most profound insight is that "well-known architectures such as Transformers are in fact linear layers with different frequency updates." The CMS is a generalization of a principle that was hiding in plain sight.\
This more sophisticated memory system is a core component of the proof-of-concept "Hope" architecture. Described as a "self-modifying recurrent architecture" and a variant of the "Titans architecture," Hope demonstrated superior performance on tasks requiring long-context reasoning.Conclusion: A Glimpse of Self-Improving AINested Learning provides a new and robust foundation for building AI that can learn without forgetting. By treating a model's architecture and its optimization rules as a single, coherent system of nested optimization problems, each compressing a context flow, we can design more expressive and efficient AI.\
The success of the Hope architecture serves as a powerful proof-of-concept. As a "self-modifying" and "self-referential" architecture, it demonstrates that these principles can lead to models that are not only more capable but also more dynamic. This represents a significant step toward creating truly self-improving AI systems.\
By closing the gap between artificial models and the human brain's ability to learn continually, what is the next great capability we will unlock in AI?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework Actually Works</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/why-the-mitre-attandck-framework-actually-works?source=rss</link><author>John Vester</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The alert goes off at 2:17 p.m.\
You count yourself lucky that this one’s in the afternoon, not morning. You drop what you’re doing, open the console, and start digging in.\
Oh, a significant spike in outbound traffic from a Kubernetes node. A privileged service account authenticating from an unfamiliar IP. Hmm, some DNS requests look… odd, but not that odd. You pivot through dashboards, trace the source in your SIEM, check cloud logs, query identity data, and even pull container logs. Nothing definitive. No confirmed breach. No clear story is emerging.\
Was it a misconfigured workload? A developer testing a deployment script? A legitimate automation job or the first step of lateral movement by someone already inside? The indicators blur together until you can’t tell if you’ve caught an attack in progress or another false positive in a sea of noise.\
Twenty minutes later, you close the ticket with the same note as the last one: “Monitoring.”\
Imagine doing that fifty times daily. The backlog grows as threats move through the network using valid credentials, blending in with legitimate activity, leaving ambiguous traces. Many security teams face a harsh reality: traditional detection systems catch known threats such as signature exploits, anomalies, and documented indicators. But attackers now mimic user behavior, hijack processes, and pivot beyond correlation rules, flooding alerts with few meaningful ones. Analysts are overwhelmed chasing false alarms while real threats go unnoticed.\
Security shouldn’t just be about stopping the bad, but understanding how the bad actually happens. Enter the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Built from years of real-world threat research, it offers a living map of how adversaries operate, move laterally, and exploit systems step by step. And when paired with a modern analytics platform, it turns that understanding into actionable visibility by showing exactly where your defenses are strong and, by contrast, where they may be weak.\
This article explains how MITRE ATT&CK shifts threat detection from reactive to proactive, how modern analytics platforms support this, and shares best practices for developing adaptive detection logic.Most security frameworks start with what went wrong after the fact. MITRE ATT&CK begins with how things go wrong in the first place.\
Developed by the nonprofit MITRE Corporation,  (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a living knowledge base of real-world attacker behavior. Each entry in the ATT&CK Matrix maps tactics (the why) and techniques (the how) that adversaries use across different stages of an intrusion.\
Instead of focusing on malware signatures or static indicators, it emphasizes observable behavior, attacker tactics like gaining access, escalating privileges, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. It's a structured playbook covering phishing, credential dumping, command-and-control, linked to threat groups and campaigns.\
For instance, the framework details how APT29 (Cozy Bear), a threat group tied to multiple espionage operations, frequently abuses legitimate credentials to blend into regular network traffic. By mapping detections to those same techniques, teams can uncover blind spots that purely signature-based tools miss.\
This behavioral model helps security and engineering teams speak a shared language. A SOC analyst investigating a PowerShell command might tag it as T1059.001 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell), while a cloud engineer reviewing IAM logs might reference T1078 (Valid Accounts). Each technique includes definitions, detection ideas, and references to confirmed incidents, making ATT&CK as practical for detection engineering as it is for incident response.\
ATT&CK's strength lies in its ongoing evolution, incorporating recent threat intelligence, observations, and community input to reflect current attacker behavior. Engineers should follow the principle: Log what matters, detect observable actions, and verify assumptions against real adversary behavior.Today, every major security platform claims “MITRE ATT&CK integration”: Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Palo Alto Networks, Sumo Logic, and Check Point. They all offer dashboards mapping detections to ATT&CK tactics and techniques. But not all dashboards are equal. Some provide only surface-level, color-coded matrices that look impressive but don’t show what’s detectable in your environment. Others display only one or two data sources, leaving visibility gaps. Few help compare coverage to real-world tactics. That’s where a modern analytics platform can help.\
For this article, we’ll use Sumo Logic’s Threat Coverage Explorer as an example of the kind of tool you can use to map detections to ATT&CK techniques. Rather than only displaying an ATT&CK matrix, it connects the dots between your real detection rules and the techniques they map to. It analyzes your security content, including correlation rules, log patterns, and detections-as-code. And it builds a visual model of your defensive coverage across all ATT&CK tactics and techniques across all this content.\
By combining the right tool with ATT&Ck, you can:See which ATT&CK techniques you can actually detect. Instead of relying on vendor defaults, you can evaluate your detections and map them to relevant ATT&CK TTPs. You see where you have visibility and where you don’t.Perform gap analysis and peer comparison. You can benchmark your coverage against industry peers at both technique and technology levels. Are your detections strong on credential access (TA0006) but weak on lateral movement (TA0008)? You’ll see it immediately.Tag custom rules with ATT&CK techniques. Detection engineers can label correlation rules with specific ATT&CK IDs like T1055 for Process Injection or T1552.001 for Unsecured Credentials in Files, enabling your content library to map to the framework automatically. This simplifies documenting, testing, and maintaining coverage as attacker behavior evolves.Visualize coverage at a glance. You can see a heatmap that shows which techniques are fully, partially, or not covered. You can drill down from tactic summaries to rules, events, and data sources. It’s more than a dashboard—it’s an actionable view of your detection maturity.\
This approach transforms ATT&CK from a theoretical framework into a living operational map. Imagine a scenario in which your logs capture credential misuse (T1078) but miss persistence mechanisms such as scheduled tasks (T1053). It exposes that blind spot before an attacker can exploit it. And because it updates dynamically as your rules or content evolve, it becomes part of your continuous detection engineering workflow rather than a one-time assessment. In the same way DevOps teams rely on observability metrics to measure system health, modern SecOps teams can now measure detection health.Using ATT&CK for a Better SecOpsThe real power of MITRE ATT&CK isn’t in its taxonomy. At its core, the ATT&CK taxonomy is a schema for adversarial behavior. Each tactic is like a stage in an attacker’s workflow, while each technique describes the specific implementation of that step. It’s a structure of how attacks unfold, grounded in empirical evidence from real intrusions rather than theoretical models. This taxonomy enables a shift from reactive firefighting to proactive defense.\
Many organizations spend their days chasing alerts. Every detection is treated as an isolated event instead of a step in a larger narrative. ATT&CK flips that mindset. By mapping activity to known adversarial tactics and techniques, teams start thinking like attackers and thereby anticipating what comes next instead of waiting for another alert to tell them.\
When combined with the right tool, this mindset becomes operational. You can test hypotheses (“If an attacker gained initial access through phishing, would we see their lateral movement?”), validate detection logic, and continuously measure improvements over time. Again, the goal isn’t about collecting more data for its own sake; it’s about collecting the correct data and understanding what it tells you in context.\
Because ATT&CK evolves as adversaries do, your detection logic can grow too. New techniques emerge in the framework as they’re observed in the wild, giving engineers a head start on updating correlation rules, dashboards, and automation playbooks before those tactics appear in production environments.\
Proactive security is a process, not a steady-state. With ATT&CK as your blueprint and the right tool as your lens, your team can move from reacting to alerts toward anticipating attacker behavior. That’s the difference between being surprised by a breach and detecting it before it becomes one.MITRE ATT&CK is Your BlueprintSecurity isn’t about building taller walls; it’s about understanding how attackers move within them. The next time that 2:17 p.m. alert fires, it doesn’t have to end with “Monitoring.” The MITRE ATT&CK framework works because it’s grounded in how real adversaries think and operate.\
With MITRE ATT&CK as your blueprint and the right tool as your lens, those same signals become context, not chaos. You’ll know which behaviors matter, where your defenses stand, and how to strengthen them before attackers can adapt. Together, they transform security from reactive noise management into a cycle of continuous learning and proactive defense, which is why ATT&CK continues to work in practice, not just in theory.\

In this article, we will explore the problems it aims to solve, explain how it works under the hood, compare the new model with the previous one, and take a closer look at the Actor model. In the upcoming parts, we will also break down executors, schedulers, structured concurrency, different types of executors, implement our own executor, and more.Swift Concurrency Overview: Problems and SolutionsConcurrency has long been one of the most challenging aspects of software development. Writing code that runs tasks simultaneously can improve performance and responsiveness, but it often introduces complexity and subtle bugs as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread-safety issues.Swift Concurrency, introduced in Swift 6, aims to simplify concurrent programming by providing a clear, safe, and efficient model for handling asynchronous tasks. It helps developers to avoid common pitfalls by enforcing strict rules around data access and execution order.💡If you use Swift 5.x and plan to migrate to Swift 6, you can enable Swift Concurrency checks in your project settings. This allows you to gradually adopt the new concurrency model while maintaining compatibility with existing code. Enabling these checks helps catch potential concurrency issues early, making the transition smoother and safer. As you update your codebase, you can start integratingsyntax and other Swift Concurrency features incrementally without a full rewrite.\
Some of the key problems Swift Concurrency addresses include:Race Conditions: Preventing simultaneous access to shared mutable state that can cause unpredictable behaviour.Callback hell: Simplifying asynchronous code that used to rely heavily on nested callbacks or completion handlers, making code easier to read and maintain.Thread management complexity: Abstracting away low-level creation and synchronization, allowing developers to focus on the logic rather than thread handling.Coordinating concurrent tasks: Structured concurrency enables clear hierarchies of tasks with proper cancellation and error propagation.By leveraging new language features like , Actors, and structured concurrency, Swift 6 provides a more intuitive and robust way to write concurrent code, improving both developer productivity and app stability.Modern operating systems and runtimes use multitasking to execute units of work concurrently. Swift Concurrency adopts cooperative multitasking, which differs fundamentally from the preemptive multitasking model used by OS-level threads. Understanding the difference is key to writing performant and safe asynchronous Swift code.Preemptive multitasking is the model used by operating systems to manage threads and processes. In this model, a system-level scheduler can forcibly interrupt any thread at virtually any moment to perform a context switch and allocate CPU time to another thread. This ensures fairness across the system and allows for responsive applications — especially when handling multiple user-driven or time-sensitive tasks.Preemptive multitasking enables true parallelism across multiple CPU cores and prevents misbehaving or long-running threads from monopolizing system resources. However, this flexibility comes at a cost. Because threads can be interrupted at any point in their execution — even in the middle of a critical operation — developers must use synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, or atomic operations to protect shared mutable state. Failing to do so may result in data races, crashes, or subtle bugs that are often difficult to detect and reproduce.This model offers greater control and raw concurrency, but it also places a significantly higher burden on developers. Ensuring thread safety in a preemptive environment is error-prone and may lead to non-deterministic behavior — behavior that varies from run to run — which is notoriously difficult to reason about or reliably test.From a technical perspective, preemptive multitasking relies on the operating system to handle thread execution. The OS can interrupt a thread at almost any point — even in the middle of a function — and switch to another. To do this, the system must perform a context switch, which involves saving the entire execution state of the current thread (such as CPU registers, the instruction pointer, and stack pointer), and restoring the previously saved state of another thread. This process may also require flushing CPU caches, invalidating the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and transitioning between user mode and kernel mode.These operations introduce significant runtime overhead. Each context switch takes time and consumes system resources — especially when context switches are frequent or when many threads compete for limited CPU cores. Additionally, preemptive multitasking forces developers to write thread-safe code by default, increasing overall complexity and the risk of concurrency bugs.While this model provides maximum flexibility and true parallelism, it’s often excessive for asynchronous workflows, where tasks typically spend most of their time waiting for I/O, user input, or network responses rather than actively using the CPU.In contrast, Swift’s concurrency runtime uses cooperative multitasking. In this model, a task runs until it voluntarily yields control — typically at an await point or via an explicit call to . Unlike traditional threads, cooperative tasks are never forcibly preempted. This results in predictable execution: context switches occur only at clearly defined suspension points.Swift’s cooperative tasks are scheduled onto a lightweight, runtime-managed cooperative thread pool—separate from Grand Central Dispatch queues. Tasks running in this pool are expected to be “good citizens,” yielding control when appropriate, especially during long-running or CPU-intensive work. To support this, Swift provides  as a manual suspension point, ensuring other tasks have a chance to execute.However, cooperative multitasking comes with a caveat: if a task never suspends, it can monopolize the thread it’s running on, delaying or starving other tasks in the system. Therefore, it is the developer’s responsibility to ensure that long-running operations include suspension points.In cooperative multitasking, the fundamental unit of execution is not a thread, but a chunk of work, often called a continuation. A continuation is a suspended segment of an asynchronous function. When an  function suspends at an , the Swift runtime captures the current execution state into a heap-allocated continuation. This continuation represents a resumption point and is enqueued for future execution.Instead of associating a thread with a long-running task, the Swift runtime treats a thread as a pipeline of continuations. Each thread executes one continuation after another. When a continuation finishes or suspends again, the thread picks up the next ready continuation from the queue.As mentioned above, this model avoids traditional OS-level context switches. There is no need to save and restore CPU registers or thread stacks; the runtime simply invokes the next closure-like continuation. This makes task switching very fast and lightweight, though it involves increased heap allocations to store the suspended async state.The key trade-off: you use a bit more memory but gain dramatically lower overhead for task management. Cooperative scheduling gives tight control over when suspensions happen, which improves predictability and makes concurrency easier to reason about.In Swift Concurrency, a  provides a unit of asynchronous work. Unlike simply calling an  function, a  is a managed object that runs concurrently with other tasks in a cooperative thread pool.💡 Tasks are managed by a cooperative thread pool. The cooperative thread pool is designed to manage concurrency efficiently by allowing tasks to yield the CPU while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete. This is achieved through the use of async functions and tasks, which are the fundamental units of concurrency in Swift.Tasks can be created to run concurrently, and they can also be awaited or canceled. They provide fine-grained control over asynchronous behavior and are an integral part of structured concurrency in Swift.A task can be created using the , which immediately launches the provided asynchronous operation:Task(priority: .userInitiated) {
  await fetchData()
}
When you create a  using the standard initializer (i.e. not ), it inherits the surrounding actor context, priority, and task-local values. This behavior is crucial for structured concurrency and safety in concurrent code.💡 Swift 6.2 introduces a significant change to how concurrency is handled: by default, all code runs on. To run code on a background, Swift 6.2 adds a new attributeUnder the hood, in earlier versions of Swift Concurrency, the Swift runtime used an internal mechanism called  to track which actor a task was associated with. Although this property wasn’t part of the public API, it played a key role in ensuring that tasks created inside actor-isolated code would execute on the same actor, preserving data race safety.With advancements in Swift, the runtime has started transitioning from  to a new mechanism known as , which is now more explicitly handled by the compiler and runtime.is a new keyword introduced in Swift 6 as a part of language’s move toward safer and more explicit concurrency. It’s used to mark function parameters and return values that are moved across concurrency boundaries. It works especially well noncopyable types, ensuring memory safety and preventing use-after-move errors. When a parameter is marked with, the compiler enforces that the original instance is no longer accessed after the transfer.func process(_ data: sending MyNonCopyableType) async {
   // `data` is moved here and can’t be used elsewhere after the call
}
\
When you launch a , you must ensure that any values captured by the task are . The compiler now enforces this at compile-time using  protocol and the  function type.Failing to conform to  may result in a compile-time error, particularly in strict concurrency mode.Tasks also support priorities, similar to how Grand Central Dispatch queues handle them.When working with Swift Concurrency, it’s important to understand the difference between  and , as they define how and where asynchronous work is executed. inherits the current actor context (such as  or any custom actor) and priority. It’s commonly used when you want to spawn a new asynchronous operation that still respects the current structured concurrency tree or actor isolation. This is especially useful for UI updates or working inside specific concurrency domains.Task {
  await updateUI()
}
In the example above, if called from the main actor, the  will also run on the main actor unless explicitly moved elsewhere. creates a completely independent task. It doesn’t inherit the current actor context or priority. This means it starts in a global concurrent context and requires manage safety, especially when accessing shared data.Task.detached {
  await performBackgroundWork()
}
Use  when you need to run background operations outside the current structured context, such as long-running computations or escaping an actor’s isolation.A Cooperative Thread Pool in Swift Concurrency is a mechanism that manages the execution of asynchronous tasks by scheduling them onto a limited number of threads, typically matching the number of CPU cores.Swift Concurrency operates using cooperative thread pool designed for efficient scheduling and minimal thread overhead. Unlike traditional thread-per-task executing model, Swift’s approach emphasizes structured concurrency and resource-aware scheduling.A common oversimplification is to say that Swift Concurrency uses one thread per core, which aligns with its goal to reduce context switching and maximize CPU utilization. While not strictly false, this view omits important nuances about quality-of-service buckets, task priorities, and Darwin scheduler behavior.Thread Count: Not So SimpleOn a 16-core Mac, it’s possible to observe up to 64-threads managed by Swift Concurrency alone - without GCD involvement. This is because Swift’s cooperative thread pool maps not just per-core, but per core per QoS bucket.Max threads = (CPU cores) × (dedicated quality-of-service buckets)
Thus, on a 16-core system:16 cores × 4 QoS buckets = 64 threads
Each QoS bucket is essentially a dedicated thread lane for a group of tasks sharing similar execution priority. These are managed internally by Darwin’s thread scheduling mechanism and are not the same as GCD queues.QoS Buckets and Task PriorityAlthough  exposes six constants, some of them are aliases: → already mapped to For the kernel’s perspective, this simplifies to 4 core priority levels, each mapped to a QoS bucket, which influences thread allocation in the cooperative thread pool.Under normal load, Swift Concurrency respects the cooperative pool limits. However, under contention (e.g. high-priority tasks waiting on low-priority ones), the system may overcommit threads to preserve responsiveness. This dynamic adjustment ensures that time-sensitive tasks aren’t blocked indefinitely behind lower-priority work.This behavior is managed by the Darwin kernel via Mach scheduling policies and high-priority  lanes - not something controlled explicitly by your code.Swift provides a priority system for tasks, similar to Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), but more semantically integrated into the structured concurrency model. You can set a task’s priority via the  initializer:Task(priority: .userInitiated) {
  await loadUserData()
}
The available priorities are defined by the  enum:| Priority | Description |
|----|----|
|  /  | For tasks initiated by user interaction that require immediate feedback. |
|  | For tasks that the user is not actively waiting for. |
|  /  | For long-running tasks that don’t require immediate results, such as copying files or importing data. |
|  | For background tasks that the user is not directly aware of. Primarily used for work the user cannot see. |Creating Tasks with Different PrioritiesWhen you create a  inside another task (default  priority), you can explicitly set a different priority for each nested task. Here, one child task is , and the other is .high. This demonstrates that priorities can be individually set regardless of the parent.Task { // .medium by default
  Task(priority: .low) {
    print("\(1), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
  }

  Task(priority: .high) {
    print("\(2), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
  }
}

// 1, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000017040c0>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.low
// 2, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000017040c0>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.high
If you don’t explicitly set a priority for a nested task, it inherits the priority of its immediate parent. In this example, the anonymous tasks inside  and  blocks inherit those respective priorities unless overridden.Task Priorities Can Be InheritedTask {
  Task(priority: .high) {
    Task {
      print("\(1), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
    }
  }

  Task(priority: .low) {
     print("\(2), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")

     Task {
      print("\(3), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
     }

     Task(priority: .medium) {
      print("\(4), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
     }
  }
}

// 2, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x600001708040>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.low
// 1, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x600001708040>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.high
// 3, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x600001708040>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.low
// 4, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x600001708040>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.medium
If you don’t explicitly set a priority for a nested task, it inherits the priority of its immediate parent. In this example, the anonymous tasks inside .high and .low blocks inherit those respective priorities unless overridden.Task(priority: .high) {
  Task {
     print("\(1), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
  }

  await Task(priority: .low) {
    print("\(2), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")

    await Task {
      print("\(3), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
    }.value

    Task(priority: .medium) {
      print("\(4), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
    }
  }.value
}

// 1, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000017000c0>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.high
// 2, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000017000c0>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.high
// 3, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000017000c0>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.high
// 4, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000017000c0>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.medium
This mechanism is called priority escalation — when a task is awaited by a higher-priority task, the system may temporarily raise its priority to avoid bottlenecks and ensure responsiveness.Task 2, which is , is escalated to  while being awaited.Task 3, which doesn’t have an explicit priority, inherits the escalated priority from its parent (Task 2) and is also executed with priority.Task 4 explicitly sets its priority to , so it is not affected by escalation. Does Not Inherit PriorityDetached tasks () run independently and do not inherit the priority of their parent task. They behave like global tasks with their own scheduling. This is useful for isolating background work, but can also lead to unexpected priority mismatches if not set manually.Task(priority: .high) {
  Task.detached {
    print("\(1), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
  }

  Task(priority: .low) {
    print("\(2), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")

    Task.detached {
      print("\(3), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
    }

    Task(priority: .medium) {
      print("\(4), "thread: \(Thread.current)", priority: \(Task.currentPriority)")
    }
  }
}

// 1, thread: <NSThread: 0x60000174dec0>{number = 4, name = (null)}, priority: TaskPriority.medium
// 2, thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x600001708180>{number = 1, name = main}, priority: TaskPriority.low
// 3, thread: <NSThread: 0x60000174dec0>{number = 4, name = (null)}, priority: TaskPriority.medium

Suspension Points and How Swift Manages Async ExecutionIn Swift, any call to an  function using  is a potential suspension point - a place in the function where executing might pause and resume latter. It’s a transformation that involves saving the state of the function so it can be resumed latter, after awaited operation completes.func fetchData() async -> String {
  let result = await networkClient.load()
  return result
}
In this case, await networkClient.load() is a suspension point. When the function reaches this line, it may pause execution, yield control to the system, and later resume once  finishes. Behind the scenes, the compiler transforms this function into a state machine that tracks its progress and internal variables.Under the Hood: Continuations and State MachinesEvery  function in Swift is compiled into a state machine. Each marks a transition point. Before reaching an , Swift:Saves the current state of the function - including local variables and the current instruction pointer.Suspends execution and schedules a continuation.Once the async operation completes, it resumes the function from where it left off.This is similar to the continuation-passing style (CPS) used in many functional programming systems. In Swift’s concurrency model, this is orchestrated by internal types like  and the concurrency runtime scheduler.When you  something in Swift, the current thread is not blocked, instead:The current task yields control back to the executorOther tasks can run while waitingWhen the awaited operation completes, the suspended task resumes on the appropriate executor.This makes  fundamentally more efficient and scalable than thread-based blocking operations like .: letting other tasks run is a static method provided by Swift’s concurrency system that voluntarily suspends the current task, giving the system opportunity to run other enqueued tasks. It’s especially useful in long-running asynchronous operations or tight loops that don’t naturally contains suspension points.func processLargeBatch() async {
    for i in 0..<1_000_000 {
        if i % 10_000 == 0 {
            await Task.yield()
        }
    }
}
Without , this loop would monopolize the executor. By inserting  periodically, you’re cooperating with Swift’s concurrency runtime, allowing to maintain responsivness and fairness.Calling await  suspends the current task and re-enqueues it at the end of the queue for its current executor (e.g., main actor or a global concurrent executor). This allows other ready-to-run tasks to take their turn.It’s part of Swift’s cooperative multitasking model: tasks run to the next suspension point and are expected to yield fairly. Unlike preemptive systems (e.g., threads), Swift tasks don’t get forcibly interrupted — they must voluntarily yield control.Swift 6 marks a significant step forward in how concurrency is handled, offering developers more control, predictability, and safety. While the learning curve may be steep at first, understanding these concepts opens the door to building highly responsive and robust applications. As we continue exploring the deeper aspects of Swift’s new concurrency model, it’s clear that these changes lay the groundwork for the future of safe and scalable app development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kubernetes Security Observability Demands More Than Just Logs</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/kubernetes-security-observability-demands-more-than-just-logs?source=rss</link><author>Fatih Koç</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:34:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most Kubernetes security tools tell you about vulnerabilities before deployment. Many can detect what’s happening during an attack, but they work in isolation without the correlation needed to piece together the full story.The typical security stack includes vulnerability scanners, Pod Security Standards, network policies, and runtime detection tools. But when a real incident occurs, teams often struggle to understand what happened because each tool generates signals in isolation. Audit logs show API calls. Falco catches suspicious behavior. Prometheus exposes metrics you can use to spot network spikes. But these signals live in different systems with different timestamps and zero shared context.The problem is correlation.That’s what observability is about.Security observability is different from application observability. You’re not debugging slow queries or memory leaks. You’re answering “Did someone just try to escalate privileges?” and “Which pods are making unexpected API calls?” in real time. This requires audit logs, runtime behavior detection, network flow analysis, and the ability to correlate security events with application traces.What security observability actually meansSecurity observability means you can answer these questions in under 60 seconds:Which pods accessed secrets in the last hour?Did any container spawn an unexpected shell process?What API calls did this suspicious service account make?Which workloads are communicating outside their expected network boundaries?Can I trace this security event back to the specific user request that triggered it?Security observability gives you investigation superpowers through correlation and context.In my OpenTelemetry pipeline post, I showed how to unify metrics, logs, and traces. This post extends that foundation to security signals. You’ll get Kubernetes audit logs flowing through your observability pipeline, runtime security events from Falco correlated with traces and security metrics that let you spot attacks as they happen.Kubernetes audit logs are underutilizedKubernetes audit logs record every API server request. User authentication, pod creation, secret access, RBAC decisions, admission webhook results. Everything that touches the API server gets logged. Most teams either disable audit logs (which is insane from a security standpoint) or dump them to S3 where they’re essentially useless during an active incident. You can’t correlate S3 logs with live application traces when you need answers in under a minute.Here’s what you’re missing when audit logs aren’t in your observability platform:A service account suddenly starts listing secrets across all namespaces. A user creates a pod with  mounts in production. Someone deletes a critical ConfigMap. An unknown source IP hits the API server with repeated authentication failures. Without audit logs in a queryable backend with correlation to application telemetry, you’re investigating these incidents with  and guessing.I’ve seen teams spend 30 minutes trying to figure out who deleted a deployment. With audit logs in Loki and correlated by user/namespace/timestamp, it takes 15 seconds.Configuring useful audit logsThe default audit policy logs everything at the RequestResponse level, which means you’ll capture full request and response bodies for every API call. This generates gigabytes per day in any moderately active cluster and most of it is noise.You want a policy that captures security-relevant events at an appropriate detail level while dropping low-value spam, such as constant health check requests.apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
  # Don't log read-only requests to common resources
  - level: None
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    resources:
      - group: ""
        resources: ["pods", "pods/status", "nodes", "nodes/status"]

  # Log secret access with metadata (who, when, which secret)
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
      - group: ""
        resources: ["secrets", "configmaps"]

  # Log RBAC changes with full request details
  - level: RequestResponse
    verbs: ["create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
    resources:
      - group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
        resources: ["clusterroles", "clusterrolebindings", "roles", "rolebindings"]

  # Log pod create/delete with request body (captures specs)
  - level: Request
    verbs: ["create", "delete"]
    resources:
      - group: ""
        resources: ["pods"]

  # Catch privilege escalations and authentication failures
  - level: RequestResponse
    omitStages: ["RequestReceived"]
    users: ["system:anonymous"]

  # Default: log metadata for everything else
  - level: Metadata
    omitStages: ["RequestReceived"]
This policy logs secret access, RBAC changes, pod mutations, and authentication anomalies while dropping noisy read-only requests. It cuts audit volume by 70-80% compared to logging everything.For managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS), audit logs are available through cloud provider logging services. For self-managed clusters, you’ll configure the API server flags in the shipping options below.Shipping audit logs to your observability pipelineAudit logs are structured JSON that you can send to any OTLP receiver or log aggregator. Choose the approach that fits your cluster setup:Option 1: File-based logging with Fluent Bit (simplest)For most setups, file-based audit logging with Fluent Bit is simpler than running a webhook server. Configure the API server to write audit logs to a file, then use Fluent Bit (already running as a DaemonSet in most observability setups) to tail and forward them.Configure API server for file-based logging:--audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
--audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit/audit.log
--audit-log-format=json
Then configure Fluent Bit to parse and forward audit logs:apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit-config
  namespace: observability
data:
  parsers.conf: |
    [PARSER]
        Name   k8s-audit

        Match   k8s.audit
        Add     service.name kubernetes-audit
        Add     signal.type security

    [OUTPUT]
        Name          forward
        Match         k8s.audit
        Host          otel-gateway.observability.svc.cluster.local
        Port          24224
        Require_ack_response  true    
This requires mounting /var/log/kubernetes/audit/ from the host into the Fluent Bit DaemonSet pods. No additional services needed.:::info
: The OpenTelemetry Collector receiving these logs must have the  receiver enabled on port 24224 (shown in the correlation section below).For managed Kubernetes, use the cloud provider’s native audit log integration. EKS sends audit logs to CloudWatch Logs, GKE to Cloud Logging, and AKS to Azure Monitor. Please forward them to your observability backend using the OpenTelemetry Collector’s cloud-specific receivers (CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor) or cloud-native export mechanisms like Pub/Sub or Event Hubs. This approach avoids running additional infrastructure but creates vendor lock-in.Option 3: Webhook backend (for specific use cases)Webhooks allow the API server to send audit events to an HTTP endpoint in real time. Use this only if you need custom transformation logic before forwarding to OpenTelemetry. Deploy a simple HTTP service that receives audit event batches from the API server and forwards them to your OTLP endpoint. Configure the API server with --audit-webhook-config-file pointing to your webhook. Most teams are better served by Option 1 or Option 2. Webhooks add operational complexity without clear benefits for typical use cases.Which option should you choose?Self-managed clusters (kubeadm, kops, etc.): Use  (Fluent Bit). You already have file access and likely run Fluent Bit for application logs.Managed Kubernetes with existing observability stack: Use  (cloud provider native). Simplest integration with no additional infrastructure.Managed Kubernetes requiring vendor neutrality: Use  (webhook) only if you need real-time streaming and can’t use  (file-based logging).Need custom enrichment or transformation: Use  (webhook) to add custom logic before forwarding to OpenTelemetry.Falco catches what static scans missFalco is a CNCF runtime security tool that watches system calls (via eBPF or kernel module) and triggers alerts on suspicious behavior. Shell spawned in a container. Sensitive file access. Unexpected network connections. Privilege escalation attempts. These are behavioral signals that only appear at runtime. Vulnerability scanners won’t catch these behaviors because they only happen during execution, and Falco is purpose-built to detect them.Installing Falco with OpenTelemetry exportFalco can export alerts to syslog, HTTP endpoints, or gRPC. You want alerts flowing into your observability pipeline as structured logs with correlation context.Install Falco with Helm and configure JSON output:helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts

  --set falco.file_output.enabled=true \
  --set falco.file_output.filename=/var/run/falco/events.log \
  --set falco.file_output.keep_alive=false
Then configure Fluent Bit (or the OpenTelemetry Filelog Receiver) to tail Falco’s output and forward to your observability backend:[INPUT]
    Name              tail
    Path              /var/run/falco/events.log
    Parser            json
    Tag               falco.events
    Refresh_Interval  5

[FILTER]
    Name    modify
    Match   falco.events
    Add     service.name falco
    Add     signal.type security

[OUTPUT]
    Name          forward
    Match         falco.events
    Host          otel-gateway.observability.svc.cluster.local
    Port          24224
Falco will now send alerts as JSON logs. Each alert includes pod name, namespace, process details, and the rule that triggered.Tuning Falco rules is critical. Out of the box, you’ll get alerts for legitimate admin activity. Create a custom rules file to suppress expected behavior:- rule: Terminal shell in container
  desc: A shell was spawned in a container
  condition: >
    spawned_process and container and 
    shell_procs and proc.tty != 0 and 
    not user_known_terminal_shell_activity    
  output: >
    Shell spawned in container (user=%user.name container=%container.name 
    shell=%proc.name parent=%proc.pname cmdline=%proc.cmdline)    
  priority: WARNING

- macro: user_known_terminal_shell_activity
  condition: >
    (container.image.repository = "my-debug-image") or
    (k8s.ns.name = "development" and user.name = "admin@example.com")    
This custom rule allows shells in debug images and development namespaces while alerting on everything else. Start with WARNING priority, review alerts weekly, and gradually tighten rules as you understand normal behavior.Correlating security events with application tracesCorrelation requires shared context: , , , . When your application logs include trace IDs and your security logs (audit + Falco) include the same pod/namespace/service metadata, you can navigate from a suspicious API call to the exact request that caused it.Here’s the key insight: use the OpenTelemetry Collector’s  processor to enrich all signals with Kubernetes metadata, then ensure applications inject trace context into every log line.Ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector has RBAC permissions:apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: observability
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "namespaces", "nodes"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["replicasets", "deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: observability
Then configure the k8sattributes processor and ensure the Collector receives Fluent Bit’s forward output on port 24224:receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols: {grpc: {}, http: {}}
  fluentforward:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:24224

    auth_type: serviceAccount

      annotations:
        - tag_name: team
          key: team
          from: pod
      labels:
        - tag_name: app
          key: app
          from: pod

  # Add security-specific attributes

    actions:
      - key: signal.type

Now every security log (audit events, Falco alerts) gets enriched with pod name, namespace, deployment, and custom labels. When you query Loki for security events, you can filter by k8s.namespace.name="production" and  to see only production security logs.With K8s metadata enrichment in place, you can now correlate security events with application traces. When suspicious behavior occurs, jump directly from the Falco alert to the trace showing the full request context.This requires injecting  into application logs. Not all security events will have trace IDs (e.g., direct  commands), but application-triggered events should.Building a security observability dashboardRaw logs and traces are useful for investigation, but you need high-level dashboards that show security posture and alert on anomalies.Here’s what makes sense in a Grafana security dashboard:API request rate by user/namespace/verbFailed authentication attempts over timeSecret access events (who accessed which secrets)RBAC change events (role bindings created/deleted)Pod creation events with privileged specsAlert rate by priority (INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL)Alert count by pod/namespaceShell spawn events in production namespacesRecent security events with links to tracesAnomaly detection (API request rates outside normal range)Use Loki queries to extract metrics from security logs:# Count secret access events per user
count_over_time({service_name="kubernetes-audit"} | json | objectRef_resource="secrets" [5m]) by (user_username)

# Count Falco alerts by priority
count_over_time({service_name="falco"} | json | priority="CRITICAL" [5m])

# Failed authentication attempts
count_over_time({service_name="kubernetes-audit"} | json | verb="create" | responseStatus_code >= 400 [5m])
Add a correlation panel that shows recent security events with drill-down links. When an alert fires, you should be able to click through to the audit log, see the associated Falco alert if any, and jump to the application trace if the event came from an app request.Retention policies for security logsSecurity logs have different retention requirements than application logs:: 1 year minimum for most compliance frameworks. PCI-DSS requires 1 year with the last 90 days immediately available. HIPAA requires 6 years for documentation, which many organizations apply to audit logs as well. These are your legal and compliance record of who did what and when.: 30-90 days is typical. You need enough history to investigate incidents and establish baseline behavior patterns, but runtime alerts are less critical for compliance than audit logs.: 7-30 days given the massive volume. Keep longer retention only for compliance-required namespaces or use sampling to reduce volume.Consider tiered storage in Loki: recent data (last 7 days) in fast storage for active investigation, older data in object storage for compliance queries. Set up log lifecycle policies to automatically expire logs based on these retention requirements. Budget for storage accordingly—audit logs and network flows can easily reach terabytes per year in production clusters.Operationalizing security observabilitySecurity observability fails when it becomes another tool nobody checks. You need to integrate it into on-call workflows and incident response runbooks.Here are approaches that work well:Include security signals in standard dashboards. Don’t isolate security metrics in a separate dashboard that only the security team sees. Add a “Security Events” panel to the main application dashboard. When developers see their service triggering Falco alerts, they investigate.Automate correlation in alerts. When a Falco alert fires, include the pod name and namespace in the alert. Add a link directly to the Loki query that shows related audit logs. Include the Grafana Explore URL with pre-filled filters.Make security logs accessible to developers. Grant read access to audit logs and Falco alerts in Loki. Developers should be able to query “Which pods in my namespace accessed secrets today?” without filing a ticket.Test your setup with attack simulations. Simulate privilege escalation and container escape attempts in a test environment. Verify that your dashboards show the activity and alerts fire. This builds confidence and identifies gaps before real incidents happen.Extending to network security observabilityAudit logs and runtime alerts cover control plane and process behavior. But network traffic is another attack vector. Unexpected egress traffic, lateral movement between pods, data exfiltration attempts. You need network flow visibility.Kubernetes Network Policies define allowed traffic, but they don’t give you observability into actual traffic. You need flow logs.Tools like Cilium (with Hubble) or Calico (with flow logs) export network flow data. These can feed into your observability pipeline as metrics or logs.Cilium Hubble exposes flow logs to files, which you can then forward to your observability pipeline. The Cilium Hubble documentation covers flow export configuration and filtering options. Configure Hubble to export flows to a file:helm upgrade cilium cilium/cilium \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set hubble.enabled=true \
  --set hubble.export.static.enabled=true \
  --set hubble.export.static.filePath=/var/run/cilium/hubble/events.log \
  --set "hubble.export.static.fieldMask={time,source.namespace,source.pod_name,destination.namespace,destination.pod_name,verdict,l4,IP}"
Then configure Fluent Bit to tail the Hubble flow logs and forward them to OpenTelemetry:[INPUT]
    Name              tail
    Path              /var/run/cilium/hubble/events.log
    Parser            json
    Tag               hubble.flows
    Refresh_Interval  5
    Mem_Buf_Limit     50MB

[FILTER]
    Name    modify
    Match   hubble.flows
    Add     service.name cilium-hubble
    Add     signal.type network

[OUTPUT]
    Name          forward
    Match         hubble.flows
    Host          otel-gateway.observability.svc.cluster.local
    Port          24224
Network flows include source/dest pod, namespace, ports, protocols, verdict (allowed/denied). You can build dashboards showing denied connections (potential policy violations), unexpected egress destinations (possible data exfiltration), and high-volume pod-to-pod traffic (lateral movement).: Network flow logging generates massive data volume. A large production cluster can produce tens to hundreds of gigabytes of flow logs daily, depending on workload patterns. Every TCP connection, every DNS query, every service-to-service call creates a flow record.Use aggressive filtering with Hubble’s  and  to focus on security-relevant flows (denied connections, external egress, cross-namespace traffic) and exclude high-volume internal service mesh traffic. Consider sampling for non-compliance workloads.For most teams, enabling flow logging selectively for production namespaces or during incident investigation is more practical than continuous full-cluster flow capture.What you can actually build with thisInvestigation speed increases dramatically. Tracking down who modified a ClusterRole binding with kubectl and grep can take anywhere from minutes to hours, depending on what logs you have. With audit logs in Loki filtered by {service_name="kubernetes-audit"} | json | objectRef_resource="clusterrolebindings" | verb="update", you get the answer in seconds. User name, timestamp, source IP, the exact change. Done.See the full attack chain. Audit logs show the API calls (listing secrets, creating pods). Falco catches the shell spawn. You see the complete sequence of events instead of isolated alerts.Compliance audits get faster. “Show me all secret access in Q3 for PCI-scoped namespaces” can take hours of manual reconstruction if logs are scattered across different systems. With Loki, it’s a single query with CSV export. Done in minutes.Alert fatigue reduces when you have context. A Falco alert fires for shell activity in production. Is it an attack or someone running  to debug? With correlation, you see the audit log showing which user ran the exec command, their role bindings, and whether it aligns with normal behavior patterns. Real incidents stand out because you can filter out expected activity.This doesn’t replace preventive controls. You still need vulnerability scanning, Pod Security Standards, network policies, and the practices from Shift Left Security. But when those controls fail and an incident happens, correlated security observability changes investigation time from hours to minutes.The goal isn’t perfect visibility. It’s actionable visibility. Can you answer “What happened?” when an alert fires? Can you trace a security event back to the request that caused it? If yes, you have enough. If not, add the missing signal.This post covered getting security signals into your observability pipeline and correlating them. The next one explores where this is heading—eBPF-native approaches, AI-assisted investigation, and the convergence of security and platform observability.The open-source approach gives you full control and flexibility, but requires ongoing maintenance. Enterprise platforms bundle these capabilities with managed infrastructure, pre-built dashboards, and support.If you’re looking at commercial options, consider Kubernetes-native platforms (Sysdig Secure, Aqua Security, Prisma Cloud), cloud provider tools (AWS GuardDuty, Google Cloud Security Command Center, Azure Defender), or SIEM platforms with Kubernetes integrations (Elastic Security, Datadog Security Monitoring, Sumo Logic). Many teams use a mix: cloud provider tools for basic monitoring, open-source for custom correlation and deep investigation, and SIEM when compliance requires centralized reporting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Engineers are Building the Hottest Geothermal Power Plant on Earth - Next to a US Volcano</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/11/22/0547231/engineers-are-building-the-hottest-geothermal-power-plant-on-earth---next-to-a-us-volcano?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["On the slopes of an Oregon volcano, engineers are building the hottest geothermal power plant on Earth," reports the Washington Post:

The plant will tap into the infernal energy of Newberry Volcano, "one of the largest and most hazardous active volcanoes in the United States," according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has already reached temperatures of 629 degrees Fahrenheit, making it one of the hottest geothermal sites in the world, and next year it will start selling electricity to nearby homes and businesses. But the start-up behind the project, Mazama Energy, wants to crank the temperature even higher — north of 750 degrees — and become the first to make electricity from what industry insiders call "superhot rock." Enthusiasts say that could usher in a new era of geothermal power, transforming the always-on clean energy source from a minor player to a major force in the world's electricity systems. 

"Geothermal has been mostly inconsequential," said Vinod Khosla, a venture capitalist and one of Mazama Energy's biggest financial backers. "To do consequential geothermal that matters at the scale of tens or hundreds of gigawatts for the country, and many times that globally, you really need to solve these high temperatures." Today, geothermal produces less than 1 percent of the world's electricity. But tapping into superhot rock, along with other technological advances, could boost that share to 8 percent by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Geothermal using superhot temperatures could theoretically generate 150 times more electricity than the world uses, according to the IEA. "We believe this is the most direct path to driving down the cost of geothermal and making it possible across the globe," said Terra Rogers, program director for superhot rock geothermal at the Clean Air Task Force, an environmentalist think tank. "The [technological] gaps are within reason. These are engineering iterations, not breakthroughs." 

The Newberry Volcano project combines two big trends that could make geothermal energy cheaper and more widely available. First, Mazama Energy is bringing its own water to the volcano, using a method called "enhanced geothermal energy"... [O]ver the past few decades, pioneering projects have started to make energy from hot dry rocks by cracking the stone and pumping in water to make steam, borrowing fracking techniques developed by the oil and gas industry... The Newberry project also taps into hotter rock than any previous enhanced geothermal project. But even Newberry's 629 degrees fall short of the superhot threshold of 705 degrees or above. At that temperature, and under a lot of pressure, water becomes "supercritical" and starts acting like something between a liquid and a gas. Supercritical water holds lots of heat like a liquid, but it flows with the ease of a gas — combining the best of both worlds for generating electricity... [Sriram Vasantharajan, Mazama's CEO] said Mazama will dig new wells to reach temperatures above 750 degrees next year. Alongside an active volcano, the company expects to hit that temperature less than three miles beneath the surface. But elsewhere, geothermal developers might have to dig as deep as 12 miles. 

While Mazama plans to generate 15 megawatts of electricity next year, it hopes to eventually increase that to 200 megawatts. (And the company's CEO said it could theoretically generate five gigawatts of power.) 

But more importantly, successful projects "motivate other players to get into the market," according to a senior geothermal research analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, who predicted "a ripple effect," to the Washington Post where "we'll start seeing more companies get the financial support to kick off their own pilots."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Made It Onto the Front Page of Hacker News and My Server Didn&apos;t Crash At All: Here&apos;s Why</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/i-made-it-onto-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-and-my-server-didnt-crash-at-all-heres-why?source=rss</link><author>Daniel, Andrei-Daniel Petrica</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:29:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mutuum Finance Presale Sells Out 95% of Phase 6 as 18,000+ Investors Join, V1 Testnet Launch Coming</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/mutuum-finance-presale-sells-out-95percent-of-phase-6-as-18000-investors-join-v1-testnet-launch-coming?source=rss</link><author>BTCWire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:28:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As crypto markets continue to search for the best crypto to buy,  is rapidly emerging as the best crypto opportunity for early investors.

In a plaintiffs’ brief filed as part of a major lawsuit against four social media companies, Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being Vaishnavi Jayakumar testified that when she joined Meta in 2020 she was shocked to learn that the company had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.” “You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” Jayakumar reportedly testified, adding that “by any measure across the industry, [it was] a very, very high strike threshold.” The plaintiffs claim that this testimony is corroborated by internal company documentation.The brief, filed by plaintiffs in the Northern District of California, alleges that Meta was aware of serious harms on its platform and engaged in a broad pattern of deceit to downplay risks to young users. According to the brief, Meta was aware that millions of adult strangers were contacting minors on its sites; that its products exacerbated mental health issues in teens; and that content related to eating disorders, suicide, and child sexual abuse was frequently detected, yet rarely removed. According to the brief, the company failed to disclose these harms to the public or to Congress, and refused to implement safety fixes that could have protected young users.  “Meta has designed social media products and platforms that it is aware are addictive to kids, and they’re aware that those addictions lead to a whole host of serious mental health issues,” says Previn Warren, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case. “Like tobacco, this is a situation where there are dangerous products that were marketed to kids,” Warren adds. “They did it anyway, because more usage meant more profits for the company.” The following allegations against Meta come from the brief filed in an unprecedented multidistrict litigation. More than 1,800 plaintiffs—including children and parents, school districts, and state attorneys general—have joined together in a suit alleging that the parent companies behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube “relentlessly pursued a strategy of growth at all costs, recklessly ignoring the impact of their products on children’s mental and physical health,” according to their master complaint. The newly unsealed allegations about Meta are just one small part of the sprawling suit. (TIME filed a motion to intervene in the case to ensure public access to court records; the motion was denied.)The plaintiffs’ brief, first reported by TIME, purports to be based on sworn depositions of current and former Meta executives, internal communications, and company research and presentations obtained during the lawsuit’s discovery process. It includes quotes and excerpts from thousands of pages of testimony and internal company documents. TIME was not able to independently view the underlying testimony or research quoted in the brief, since those documents remain under seal.  But the brief still paints a damning picture of the company’s internal research and deliberations about issues that have long plagued its platforms. Plaintiffs claim that since 2017, Meta has aggressively pursued young users, even as its internal research suggested its social media products could be addictive and dangerous to kids. Meta employees proposed multiple ways to mitigate these harms, according to the brief, but were repeatedly blocked by executives who feared that new safety features would hamper teen engagement or user growth.“We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. "The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and we stand by our record.”In the years since the lawsuit was filed, Meta has implemented new safety features designed to address some of the problems described by plaintiffs. In 2024, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen Accounts, which defaults any user between 13 and 18 into an account that is automatically private, limits sensitive content, turns off notifications at night, and doesn’t allow messaging from unconnected adults. “We know parents are worried about their teens having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online, and that’s why we’ve significantly reimagined the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts,” a Meta spokeswoman told TIME in June. “These accounts provide teens with built-in protections to automatically limit who’s contacting them and the content they’re seeing, and teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to change those settings. We also give parents oversight over their teens’ use of Instagram, with ways to see who their teens are chatting with and block them from using the app for more than 15 minutes a day, or for certain periods of time, like during school or at night.”And yet the plaintiffs’ brief suggests that Meta resisted safety changes like these for years. The brief quotes testimony from Brian Boland, Meta’s former vice president of partnerships who worked at the company for 11 years and resigned in 2020. “My feeling then and my feeling now is that they don’t meaningfully care about user safety,” he allegedly said. “It’s not something that they spend a lot of time on. It’s not something they think about. And I really think they don’t care.”After the plaintiffs’ brief was unsealed late Friday night, Meta did not immediately respond to TIME’s requests for comment. Here are some of the most notable allegations from the plaintiffs’ omnibus brief: Allegation: Meta had a high threshold for "sex trafficking" content—and no way to report child sexual contentDespite Instagram’s “zero tolerance” policy for child sexual abuse material, the platform did not offer users a simple way to report child sexual abuse content, according to the brief. Plaintiffs allege that Jayakumar raised the issue multiple times when she joined Meta in 2020, but was told it would be too difficult to address. Yet Instagram allowed users to easily report far less serious violations, like “spam,” “intellectual property violation” and “promotion of firearms,” according to plaintiffs.Jayakumar was even more shocked to learn that Instagram had a disturbingly high tolerance for sex trafficking on the platform. According to the brief, she testified that Meta had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex,” meaning it would take at least 16 reports for an account to be deleted.   “Meta never told parents, the public, or the Districts that it doesn’t delete accounts that have engaged over fifteen times in sex trafficking,” the plaintiffs wrote. A Meta spokesperson disputed this allegation to TIME, saying the company has for years removed accounts immediately if it suspects them of human trafficking or exploitation and has made it easier over time for users to report content that violates child-exploitation policies. Allegation: Meta "lied to Congress" about its knowledge of harms on the platformFor years, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s internal research had found that teenagers who frequently use Instagram and Facebook have higher rates of anxiety and depression. In late 2019, according to the brief, Meta designed a “deactivation study,” which found that users who stopped using Facebook and Instagram for a week showed lower rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Meta halted the study and did not publicly disclose the results, stating that the research study was biased by the “existing media narratives around the company.” (A Meta spokesperson told TIME that the study was initially conceived as a pair of one-weeks pilots, and researchers declined to continue it because it found that the only reductions in feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were among people who already believed Facebook was bad for them.)At least one Meta employee was uncomfortable with the implications of this decision: “If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak,” this employee wrote, according to the brief, “is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”Indeed, in December 2020, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the company in a set of written questions whether it was “able to determine whether increased use of its platform among teenage girls has any correlation with increased signs of depression” and “increased signs of anxiety,” the company offered only a one-word answer: “No.”To the plaintiffs in the case, the implication is clear: “The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study. Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.”Allegation: The company knew Instagram was letting adult strangers connect with teenagersFor years Instagram has had a well-documented problem of adults harassing teens. Around 2019, company researchers recommended making all teen accounts private by default in order to prevent adult strangers from connecting with kids, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. Instead of implementing this recommendation, Meta asked its growth team to study the potential impact of making all teen accounts private. The growth team was pessimistic, according to the brief, and responded that the change would likely reduce engagement. By 2020, the growth team had determined that a private-by-default setting would result in a loss of 1.5 million monthly active teens a year on Instagram. The plaintiffs’ brief quotes an unnamed employee as saying: “taking away unwanted interactions… is likely to lead to a potentially untenable problem with engagement and growth.” Over the next several months, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s policy, legal, communications, privacy, and well-being teams all recommended making teen accounts private by default, arguing that the switch “will increase teen safety” and was in line with expectations from users, parents, and regulators. But Meta did not launch the feature that year. Safety researchers were dismayed, according to excerpts of an internal conversation quoted in the filing. One allegedly grumbled: “Isn’t safety the whole point of this team?” “Meta knew that placing teens into a default-private setting would have eliminated 5.4 million unwanted interactions a day,” the plaintiffs wrote. Still, Meta didn’t make the fix. Instead, inappropriate interactions between adults and kids on Instagram skyrocketed to 38 times that on Facebook Messenger, according to the brief. The launch of Instagram Reels allegedly compounded the problem. It allowed young teenagers to broadcast short videos to a wide audience, including adult strangers..An internal 2022 audit allegedly found that Instagram’s Accounts You May Follow feature recommended 1.4 million potentially inappropriate adults to teenage users in a single day. By 2023, according to the plaintiffs, Meta knew that they were recommending minors to potentially suspicious adults and vice versa. It wasn’t until 2024 that Meta rolled out default privacy settings to all teen accounts. In the four years it took the company to implement their own safety recommendations, teens experienced billions of unwanted interactions with strangers online. Inappropriate encounters between teens and adults were common enough, according to the brief, that the company had an acronym for them: “IIC,” or “inappropriate interactions with children.” A Meta spokesperson said the company has defaulted teens under 16 to private accounts since 2021, began defaulting teens under 18 into private accounts with the introduction of its Teen Accounts program, and has taken steps to protect users from online predators. Allegation: Meta aggressively targeted young usersMeta feared young users would abandon Facebook and Instagram for their competitors. Acquiring and keeping young users became a central business goal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that “teen time spent be our top goal of 2017,” according to a company executive quoted in the brief. That has remained the case, plaintiffs allege; internal company documents from 2024 stated that “acquiring new teen users is mission critical to the success of Instagram.” (A Meta spokesperson said time spent on its platforms is not currently a company goal.)Meta launched a campaign to connect with school districts and paid organizations like the National Parent Teacher Association and Scholastic to conduct outreach to schools and families. Meanwhile, according to the brief, Meta used location data to push notifications to students in “school blasts,” presumably as part of an attempt to increase youth engagement during the school day. As one employee allegedly put it: “One of the things we need to optimize for is sneaking a look at your phone under your desk in the middle of Chemistry :)”.Though Meta aggressively pursued young users, it may not have known exactly how old those new users were. Whistleblower Jason Sattizahn recently testified to Congress that Meta does not reliably know the age of its users. (Meta pushed back on Sattizahn’s testimony, saying in a statement to NBC that his claims were “nonsense” and “based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.”) In 2022, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, there were 216 million users on Meta platforms whose age was “unknown.”Federal law requires social media platforms to observe various data-privacy safeguards for users under 13, and Meta policy states that users under 13 are not allowed on its platforms. Yet the plaintiffs’ court filing claims Meta knew that children under 13 used the company’s products anyway. Internal research cited in the brief suggested there were 4 million users under 13 on Instagram in 2015; by 2018, the plaintiffs claim, Meta knew that roughly 40% of children aged 9 to 12 said they used Instagram daily.The plaintiffs allege that this was a deliberate business strategy. The brief describes a coordinated effort to acquire young users that included studying the psychology and digital behavior of “tweens” and exploring new products designed for “users as young as 5-10.” Internally, some employees expressed disgust at the attempt to target preteens. “Oh good, we’re going after <13 year olds now?” one wrote, according to the brief. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.”Allegation: Meta's executives initially shelved efforts to make Instagram less toxic for teensTo combat toxic “social comparison,” in 2019 Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced a new product feature that would “hide” likes on posts. Meta researchers had determined that hiding likes would make users “significantly less likely to feel worse about themselves,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief. The initiative was code-named Project Daisy. But after a series of tests, Meta backtracked on Project Daisy. It determined the feature was “pretty negative to FB metrics,” including ad revenue, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, which quotes an unnamed employee on the growth team insisting: “It’s a social comparison app, fucking get used to it.” A similar debate took place over the app’s beauty filters. Plaintiffs claim that an internal review concluded beauty filters exacerbated the “risk and maintenance of several mental health concerns, including body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder,” and that Meta knew that “children are particularly vulnerable.” Meta banned beauty filters in 2019, only to roll them back out the following year after the company realized that banning beauty filters would have a “negative growth impact,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief. Other company researchers allegedly built an AI “classifier” to identify content that would lead to negative appearance comparison, so that Meta could avoid recommending it to vulnerable kids. But Mosseri allegedly killed the project, disappointing developers who “felt like they had a solution” to “a big problem.”Allegation: Meta doesn't automatically remove harmful content, including self-harm contentWhile Meta developed AI tools to monitor the platforms for harmful content, the company didn’t automatically delete that content even when it determined with “100% confidence” that it violated Meta’s policies against child sexual-abuse material or eating-disorder content. Meta’s AI classifiers did not automatically delete posts that glorified self-harm unless they were 94% certain they violated platform policy, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. As a result, most of that content remained on the platform, where teenage users often discovered it. In a 2021 internal company survey cited by plaintiffs, more than 8% of respondents aged 13 to 15 reported having seen someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so, on Instagram during the past week.A Meta spokesperson said the company reports more child sexual-abuse material than any other service and uses an array of tools to proactively find that content, including photo and video-matching technologies as well as machine learning. The spokesperson said human reviewers assess content flagged before it is deleted to ensure it violates policies, prevent mistakes that could affect users, and maintain the integrity of the company's detection databases. Allegation: Meta knew its products were addictive, but publicly downplayed the harmsThe addictive nature of the company’s products wasn’t a secret internally. “Oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” one of the company’s user-experience researchers allegedly wrote to a colleague. “We’re basically pushers.” Meta does not officially study addiction to its products, plaintiffs allege; it studies “problematic use.” In 2018, company researchers surveyed 20,000 Facebook users in the U.S. and found that 58% had some level of “problematic use”—55% mild, and 3.1% severe. But when Meta published an account of this research the following year, only the smaller number of users with “severe” problematic use was mentioned. “We estimate (as an upper bound) that 3.1% of Facebook users in the U.S. experience problematic use,” wrote the researchers. The other 55% of users are not mentioned anywhere in the public report. Plaintiffs allege that Meta’s safety team proposed features designed to lessen addiction, only to see them set aside or watered down. One employee who helped develop a “quiet mode” feature said it was shelved because Meta was concerned that this feature would negatively impact metrics related to growth and usage.Around the same time, another user-experience researcher at Instagram allegedly recommended that Meta inform the public about its research findings: “Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” the researcher wrote, Meta needed to “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.” This story has been updated to reflect additional comments from Meta. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Israel launches multiple air strikes on Gaza despite ceasefire | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z3TZelbUGnQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z3TZelbUGnQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:17:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Multiple Israeli air strikes hit Gaza on Saturday, making it one of the deadliest days since the US-brokered ceasefire took effect on October 10.

The logic was simple: bigger models and more data would pave the road to true intelligence. But this narrative, while compelling, misses the ground truth that engineers have been living. The real story isn't a glamorous race to the top; it's been a grueling, frustrating slog out of the mud.That slog is finally over. The scaling race didn't end because someone won; it ended because we finally reached a reliable starting line. The foundational models are, at last, good enough. And now, the real work—the real innovation—can begin. The defensible moat has moved decisively up the stack to the application layer, and the new metrics for success have nothing to do with parameter counts. They're about cost, speed, and creative problem-solving.Chapter 1: The Age of ScaffoldingIt’s easy to forget what the engineering reality was like just a short time ago. The models, frankly, just didn't work. Not in a reliable, production-ready sense. The daily battle wasn't about fine-tuning for subtle improvements; it was a desperate struggle to compensate for fundamental brittleness.We were living in the "Age of Scaffolding." Our primary role was building elaborate, multi-layered error-checking and correction systems around a fragile model core just to coax a usable, predictable output from it. I recall one project where our goal was to extract structured data from user requests. The model would fail so spectacularly and unpredictably that our solution became a comical Rube Goldberg machine of prompts.The first prompt would ask the model to identify the user's intent. The second prompt would take that intent and the original text, asking the model to extract key entities. But the model would often hallucinate entities or return malformed JSON. So, a third prompt was needed. This one was a "cleanup" prompt: it took the broken JSON from the previous step and, with heavily constrained instructions, tried to fix it. We were literally , chaining prompts together just to achieve a single logical task. One particularly memorable bug involved the model deciding to return a beautifully formatted, completely valid JSON object that was, however, entirely unrelated to the input text, requiring yet another validation layer to check for semantic relevance.In that environment, a "win" wasn't a breakthrough in AI capability. A win was a . It was getting through a full process without a catastrophic failure. We spent the vast majority of our engineering cycles not on creating value, but on managing failure. This was the scaling grind in practice: an immense effort just to reach a baseline of bare-minimum functionality.Chapter 2: The Phase ChangeThen, everything changed. The arrival of models like GPT-4 and, more recently, Claude 3.5, marked a true inflection point. It wasn't just another incremental step up the leaderboard. It was a phase change. Suddenly, the foundation was solid. The core "brain" became reliable, capable, and, most importantly, predictable.This shift did more than just improve model outputs; it fundamentally altered the structure of our teams and the nature of our work. The need for elaborate, defensive scaffolding began to melt away. Roadmaps that were once filled with tickets like "Improve JSON output reliability" could now be filled with tickets like "Build new agentic workflow for customer support." The percentage of our time spent on "model-proofing" our code dropped from an estimated 80% to less than 20%.The liberation of engineering creativity from the prison of model unreliability was the true catalyst for the Application Age. When you no longer have to spend the majority of your time wrestling the model into submission, you can start asking a much more powerful question: "What can we build with this?"Chapter 3: The New Physics of AIToday, we live in a different world. For a vast majority of use cases, the top-tier models from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others are  The qualitative difference in output for most common tasks is marginal. This is the hallmark of a maturing, commoditized technology. When core functionality is a given, the competitive battleground shifts entirely to the operational realities of deploying it at scale.3a. The Economics of Intelligence The primary concern is now . When you're running millions of inferences a day, a fraction of a cent difference per token determines the economic viability of your entire product. This has given rise to sophisticated strategies like "model routing" or "cascading."For example, a user request might first be sent to a very fast, cheap model like Claude 3 Haiku. If that model can handle the request with sufficient quality (a determination often made by another small, fast model), the process ends there, at a minimal cost. If the model fails or indicates low confidence, the request is then "cascaded" up to a more powerful, and expensive, model like GPT-4o. This allows for optimizing cost on a per-query basis, a level of financial engineering that was irrelevant when the only goal was getting a single model to work at all.3b. The User Experience of Speed The second pillar is . Latency is a user experience killer. The perceived intelligence of a system is directly tied to its responsiveness. A brilliant answer that takes ten seconds to generate feels less useful than a good-enough answer that appears instantly.This has led to a fascinating trade-off space. In a recent project, we were building a real-time coding assistant. We had two choices: use our most powerful model, which provided incredibly insightful suggestions but had a high "time-to-first-token," creating a noticeable lag, or use a smaller, fine-tuned model that was 80% as "smart" but delivered its suggestions almost instantly. We chose speed. The feeling of a seamless, responsive interaction was more valuable to the user than the marginal increase in code quality from the slower model.Chapter 4: Where Value is Built NowWith cost and speed as the new constraints, the patterns for building successful, defensible AI businesses have become clear. The value is not in the model, but in the system built around it. We are seeing three dominant patterns emerge: These companies deeply integrate AI into a specific professional workflow, becoming an indispensable tool.  for law is the canonical example. They are not selling a generic LLM; they are selling a "legal co-pilot" that understands the specific tasks, documents, and needs of a lawyer. Their moat is the deep domain expertise encoded in their application logic. These are systems that automate complex, multi-step tasks by chaining model calls and tools together. The value is in the orchestration layer that can reliably plan and execute toward a goal. This is where the true promise of automation lies, moving beyond simple text generation to active problem-solving. The key challenge and source of differentiation here is in reliability and state management. Companies like  are creating novel, AI-native user experiences that are fundamentally different from traditional search or chat. Their interface is the product, providing a new way to access and synthesize information that is more valuable than the underlying models they use.Chapter 5: The AI Engineer, ReimaginedThis new landscape demands a new kind of engineer. The skills that were paramount just a few years ago—like the arcane art of prompt engineering or the intricacies of tuning training hyperparameters—are becoming less critical. The most valuable AI engineers today are not model whisperers; they are product-minded system builders.My advice to a young engineer starting today would be this: Don't obsess over the internal mechanics of the latest model. Instead, get exceptionally good at building systems around them. Key skills for the Application Age include:API Integration & Orchestration: The ability to effectively use tools like LangChain or build custom frameworks to chain tools, databases, and model calls together.Cost & Latency Optimization: Deeply understanding the trade-offs of different models and implementing strategies like model cascading. Designing reliable systems for long-running, multi-step agentic tasks. Collaborating with designers to build intuitive interfaces for non-deterministic systems.Chapter 6: Second-Order Effects and the Road AheadThe commoditization of intelligence will have profound second-order effects. When every developer has access to a super-powerful, low-cost "brain" via an API call, it fundamentally changes what can be built. We will see a Cambrian explosion of new companies in fields previously untouched by software because the cost of building intelligent features was too high.This shift also democratizes innovation. A small, agile team can now create a product with a level of sophistication that would have required a massive, dedicated research division just five years ago. The competitive advantage will go to those with the deepest understanding of a user's problem, not those with the largest GPU cluster.The engineering challenge has transformed. We've moved from the brute-force problem of taming unreliable models to the far more interesting and creative challenge of designing products in a world of abundant, cheap, and fast intelligence. The foundational models are here. They work. They aren't AGI, but they are a permanent and transformative new layer of the technology stack. The focus is no longer on the raw materials, but on the art of manufacturing.The scaling race is over. The application race has just begun.Now, what will you build on top of them?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Practical Guide to Prompt Engineering for Today’s LLMs</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/a-practical-guide-to-prompt-engineering-for-todays-llms?source=rss</link><author>Nick Talwar</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 14:51:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The overlooked communication skill that decides whether or not AI performs at scale.Prompt engineering is both creative and precise. Good prompts come from clear intent, structured testing, and constant refinement through an organized engineering and testing process.Early work with large language models depended on trial and error. Today, prompting has evolved into a professional skill.Prompting now requires the same structured thinking you’d use to design any system. You need to understand how models interpret language and how to express intent in a way they can follow.Strong prompt engineers think in steps, measure results, track changes, A/B test, and improve over time. The more precise the instruction, the more consistent the outcome.I’ve spent over 15 years building AI and machine learning systems for startups and global enterprises. My work began at Microsoft, where I focused on large-scale recommendation systems and search algorithms to serve hundreds of millions of customers at scaleIn this blog, I’ll share the practical methods I use to design, test, and refine prompts that consistently deliver accurate and useful outputs.Core Techniques for Better ResultsThe fundamentals of effective prompting apply across industries. These techniques provide control, accuracy, and repeatability.. Define the model’s role clearly, such as strategist, researcher, or analyst, with clear characteristics. Context shapes focus and improves accuracy.. Set boundaries for tone, format, and length. Clear limits reduce ambiguity and guide responses.. Break tasks into defined steps or sections. This improves the model's logic and helps it handle complex instructions.. Include sample outputs that demonstrate what good performance looks like. Examples teach tone and precision faster than written explanation.They also show the format in which you would like the output to adhere, which is very important as LLMs can play “jazz” more often than not and deliver responses in formats you would not expect.Each of these methods supports consistency and efficiency. Together, they create a foundation for reliable, repeatable AI results.Once the basics are in place, advanced prompting techniques help the model reason and perform more effectively.Chain of Thought Prompting. Encourage the model to outline its reasoning process step by step. This approach improves accuracy and transparency and provides a lens into how the response was put together, a key necessity for auditability and long-term maintainability.Tree of Thought Prompting. Ask the model to explore several reasoning paths before selecting the best one. This strengthens analysis and creativity simultaneously, an often overlooked method to ensure that responses cover their bases and iterate through multiple perspectives before the LLM lands on what it believes to be the best.. Link prompts together so that each output becomes input for the next step. This structure is useful for multi-stage tasks and processes that require strict adherence plus compliance checks at each step before moving on to the next. Include factual data or contextual details to ground the model’s reasoning. This reduces error and strengthens credibility.. When performance stalls, you can use tools like NotebookLM, which uses the latest Google Gemini models to review all prompts together and refine the prompt itself.NotebookLM and other project-based LLM tools that allow for multiple files to be uploaded and reviewed can often identify structural or phrasing improvements.These methods move prompting beyond surface-level interaction. They help create reasoning frameworks that scale to complex challenges.Coupled with a regular, iterative auditing process, perhaps even using GitHub for change tracking, these strategies turn the “black box” of prompting from magic into something more organized and predictable, with better, more accurate outputs from LLMs.Prompt engineering works best when it focuses on clarity and oversight.LLMs simulate reasoning by pattern-matching in data. They require review and context to ensure accuracy.Strong prompts resemble concise professional briefs. They communicate intent clearly and efficiently. Prompting rewards discipline. The more direct the instruction, the more consistent the output.With that said, examples or templates in the prompt need not be concise, as context windows are extremely large. Do not hesitate to provide a ten or twenty-page example output of a canonical work product to help guide the LLM as a North Star with key details.The fundamentals of prompt engineering remain constant, even as AI technology evolves. To achieve consistent and scalable AI outcomes, focus on three key principles: clarity, structure, and consistency.Clarity is essential for generating accurate and actionable results. When prompts are unclear or ambiguous, the AI's responses will reflect that, potentially leading to wasted effort.A precise prompt with key examples, no matter how long, is critical for ensuring the AI delivers what is needed.Remember, LLMs gain clarity via context, and providing more of it, within reason, can help support a more consistent, predictable, and accurate implementation.Structure is equally important. A well-organized prompt improves the AI’s ability to deliver reliable, relevant outputs. Whether you're implementing AI in customer service or operational tasks, structured prompts reduce the risk of errors and improve efficiency.Consistency matters when scaling AI solutions. Keeping prompts clear and structured across the board allows the AI to adapt and perform consistently, even as business needs evolve. It is vital to ensure that the AI remains effective as it scales.Treat prompt engineering as an ongoing process. Regular refinement ensures that AI systems stay aligned with business goals and continue to evolve with technological advances.Ensure that your teams have a process and system in place to regularly QA test and iterate, plus audit prompts with a detailed change log. Without it, you may easily regress or reintroduce past LLM foibles into production.Prompting is at the heart of how humans collaborate with AI.

The  Pectra EIPs focus on improving performance, security, and developer tools. PeerDAS () makes data availability more efficient by letting nodes verify blobs without downloading everything. Several upgrades tighten execution safety, including limits on ModExp (), a cap on transaction gas limits (), and updated ModExp gas costs (). The fork also improves block production with deterministic proposer lookahead () and keeps blob fees stable with bounds tied to execution costs (). Additional enhancements include limiting block size in RLP format (), adding a new CLZ opcode for faster bit operations (), and introducing a secp256r1 precompile () for better compatibility with modern cryptography and hardware security keys.Just as Pectra combined “Prague” and “Electra,” Fusaka is a combined name of  and . It represents Ethereum’s next leap toward a highly scalable, data-rich future where Layer 2 rollups can operate cheaper and faster.In this blog, we’ll break down the core features of the Fusaka hard fork, explain how PeerDAS works in practice, and walk through the real network requirements for home stakers, supernodes, and full nodes — backed by devnet data.Key Changes Introduced In Fusaka Hard ForkEIP-7594: PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability SamplingEthereum needed this proposal because the network wants to provide more data availability for users and especially for rollups, but with the current  design, every node still has to download too much blob data just to check that it was actually published. This creates a scaling problem because if all nodes must download everything, the network’s bandwidth and hardware requirements go up, and decentralization can suffer. To fix this, Ethereum needs a way for nodes to confirm that data is available without downloading all of it. Data Availability Sampling (DAS) solves this by letting nodes check only small random pieces of the data. But Ethereum also needs a DAS method that fits well with the existing gossip network and doesn’t add heavy computation to block producers. PeerDAS was created to meet these needs and safely increase blob throughput while keeping node requirements low.PeerDAS is a networking system that lets nodes download only small pieces of blob data to check that the full data was actually published. Instead of downloading everything, nodes use the normal gossip network to share data, discover which peers hold certain parts, and request just the small samples they need. The main idea is that by downloading only tiny, random parts of the blob, nodes can still be confident that the entire blob exists. For example, instead of downloading a full 256 KB blob, a node might download only about 1/8 of it—but because many nodes sample different parts, any missing data would quickly be noticed.To make sampling work, PeerDAS expands each blob from  using a basic type of erasure coding. Erasure coding is a technique that adds extra redundant data so that the original data can be recovered even if some pieces are missing—similar to how you can complete a puzzle even if a few pieces are lost. The blob becomes a “row” that contains the original data plus some extra coded data that allows it to be rebuilt later. This row is then split into many small pieces called cells, which are the smallest verified units tied to a KZG commitment. All rows are then reorganized into “columns,” where each column contains the cell at the same position from every row. Each column is assigned to a specific gossip subnet. Nodes are responsible for storing certain columns based on their node ID and for sampling a few columns from peers every slot. If a node collects at least 50% of all columns, it can fully rebuild the data. If it has less than 50%, it simply requests the missing columns from peers. This ensures that if the data was actually published, it can always be reconstructed. In short, if there are 64 columns in total, a node only needs about 32 of them to rebuild the full blob. It keeps some columns itself and downloads a few from peers. As long as half the columns exist in the network, the node can reconstruct everything—even if some columns are missing.Additionally, the EIP introduces an important rule: no transaction can contain more than 6 blobs. This limit must be enforced during transaction validation, gossip, block creation, and block processing. This helps reduce extreme cases where a single transaction overloads the blob system.PeerDAS adds something called . A cell KZG proof shows that a KZG commitment really matches one specific cell (one small piece) of a blob. This lets a node download only the cells it wants to sample, instead of the full blob, while still guaranteeing data integrity. This is essential for data availability sampling.But generating all these cell proofs is expensive. A block producer would need to compute them again and again for many blobs, which is too slow. Proof verification, however, is very cheap. So the EIP requires the blob transaction sender to generate all the cell proofs ahead of time and include them in the transaction wrapper.Because of this, the transaction gossip (PooledTransactions) now uses a modified wrapper:rlp([tx_payload_body, wrapper_version, blobs, commitments, cell_proofs])
Inside the new wrapper,  is just a list that contains every proof for every cell of every blob (for example: [cell_proof_0, cell_proof_1, ...]). The other fields — , , and  — are exactly the same as they were in EIP-4844. The difference is that the old single “proofs” field is removed and replaced with this new  list, and a new field called  is added to show which wrapper format is being used.The  is a single byte, and in this proposal it is always set to . The  field contains all of the cell proofs for each blob, including the proofs for the extra extension cells created during erasure coding. Because of the erasure coding, each blob corresponds to  cell proofs. Even though the list contains proofs for the extension cells, the blobs themselves are still sent in their normal (non-extended) form. A blob only includes its original half—the receiving node can compute the extension half on its own, so there’s no need to send unnecessary data.More formally, cell_proofs[i * CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB + j] is the proof for the j-th cell of the i-th blob after running , which produces both the original and extension cells.When a node receives this wrapper, it must validate the transaction and check that everything lines up correctly. It must verify that the number of versioned hashes, blobs, and commitments all match. It must also confirm that  contains exactly CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB * number_of_blobs proofs. Every commitment must hash to its matching versioned hash (kzg_to_versioned_hash(commitments[i]) == tx_payload_body.blob_versioned_hashes[i]). Finally, the node must check that each commitment actually matches the blob and its proofs. To do this, it computes the extension cells locally using , and then verifies all the cell proofs—batch verification is allowed to make this faster.: Imagine a blob is split into  after erasure coding (). The original blob contains , and the receiving node will compute the missing  itself. But the sender must include  in . So for 1 blob, the transaction wrapper contains: (only original 4 cells)commitments = [commitment_0]cell_proofs = [proof_0, proof_1, …, proof_7] (proof for each of the 8 cells)When a node samples, it might request only cell 2 or cell 5, and it can verify them instantly using the matching proofs, without ever downloading the full blob.PeerDAS lets Ethereum increase data availability without making nodes work harder. Today, a node only needs to sample about 1/8 of the total blob data. In the future, this might even go down to , which would let Ethereum scale more. The system works well because every node has many peers. So if one peer does not give the required data, the node can simply ask another peer. This creates natural redundancy and improves security. Nodes can also choose to store  data than required, which further strengthens the network—even without any protocol changes.Validators have a bit more responsibility than normal full nodes. Since validators already run stronger hardware, PeerDAS gives them a data-custody load that matches the total number of validators. This ensures that a stable group of nodes is always available to store and share more data, which makes the network more reliable. In short, if there are 900,000 validators, each validator might be assigned a tiny portion of the total blob data to store and serve. Because validators have better machines, the network can trust them to keep this data available.PeerDAS uses  instead of row sampling because it makes rebuilding the data much easier. If nodes sampled full rows (whole blobs), they would need to create extra “extension blobs” that don’t naturally exist, which would slow down block producers. By sampling columns, nodes can prepare the extra row data in advance, and the transaction senders—not the block producers—compute the necessary proofs. This keeps block creation fast and efficient.  Imagine a blob is a 4×4 grid of cells. Row sampling would mean taking all 4 cells from one row, but some extension rows aren’t ready yet, so the block producer would have to generate them on the spot. Column sampling means taking one cell from each row (a column). The extra cells needed for reconstruction can be prepared ahead of time, so nodes can verify the data without slowing down block production. works fully with , so it doesn’t break anything already on Ethereum. All tests and detailed rules are in the consensus and execution specs.The main security risk in any DAS system is a “data withholding attack,” where a block producer pretends that data is available but actually hides some of it. PeerDAS prevents this by using random sampling: nodes check random parts of the data. The more nodes that are sampled, the harder it is for an attacker to cheat. The EIP even provides a formula to calculate how likely such an attack could succeed, based on the total number of nodes (n), total samples (m), and samples per node (k). On the Ethereum mainnet, with about 10,000 nodes, the chance of a successful attack is extremely small, so PeerDAS is considered safe.The table shows that the chances of a successful attack drop to a negligible level, which is why PeerDAS is considered secure against data-withholding attacks. For deeper analysis, you can refer to the linked blog.This proposal is needed because the current MODEXP precompile in Ethereum has caused many consensus bugs over the years. Most of these bugs happened because MODEXP allows extremely large and unrealistic input sizes, which creates endless, unusual cases that clients must handle. Since every node has to process whatever input a transaction provides, having no upper limit makes MODEXP harder to test, easier to break, and more likely to behave differently across different clients. Very large inputs also make the gas-cost formula hard to predict, because it is difficult to price something when its size can grow without limit. These problems also make it difficult to replace MODEXP with future EVM-level code through tools like EVMMAX, because without fixed limits, developers cannot create safe and optimized execution paths. To reduce these issues and make Ethereum more stable, this proposal adds strict maximum sizes to MODEXP inputs so that the precompile becomes safer, easier to test, and more predictable.EIP-7823 introduces a simple rule: all three length fields used by MODEXP—the size of the BASE, the EXPONENT, and the MODULUS—must be , which is 1024 bytes. MODEXP inputs follow the format <len(BASE)> <len(EXPONENT)> <len(MODULUS)> <BASE> <EXPONENT> <MODULUS>, as defined in , so this EIP only restricts the length values. If any length exceeds 1024 bytes, the precompile immediately stops, returns an error, and burns all gas. For example, if someone tries to provide a BASE that is 2000 bytes long, the call will fail before any work happens. These limits still support all real use cases. RSA verification typically uses key sizes like 1024, 2048, or 4096 bits, all well within the new limit. Elliptic curve operations use even smaller sizes, often under 384 bits, so they are also unaffected.These new limits also help with future upgrades. If MODEXP is ever rewritten in EVM code using EVMMAX, developers could add optimized paths for common input sizes like 256 bits, 381 bits, or 2048 bits, and use a slower fallback for rarer cases. With fixed maximum sizes, developers can even add special handling for very common modulus values. None of this was realistic before, because the unlimited input sizes made the design space too large to manage safely.To confirm that this change would not break past transactions, the authors analyzed all MODEXP usage from block 5,472,266 (April 20, 2018) to block 21,550,926 (January 4, 2025). The results show that no successful historical MODEXP call ever used inputs larger than , far below the new 1024-byte limit. Most real calls used small lengths like 32 bytes, 128 bytes, or 256 bytes. There were a few invalid or broken calls, such as empty inputs, inputs filled with repeating bytes like , and one extremely large but invalid input. These would behave the same under the new limits because they were already invalid. So, while the EIP is technically a breaking change, in practice it would not have changed the outcome of any past transaction.From a security point of view, reducing the allowed input sizes does not create new risks. Instead, it removes unnecessary extreme cases that previously caused bugs and inconsistencies across clients. By limiting MODEXP inputs to realistic sizes, this EIP makes the system more predictable, reduces strange corner cases, and lowers the chance of errors between different implementations. These constraints also help prepare the system for a smoother transition if future upgrades like EVMMAX introduce optimized execution paths.Ethereum needed this proposal because today a single transaction can use almost the entire block gas limit. This creates several problems: one transaction could consume most of the block’s resources and cause a DoS-style slowdown, large gas-heavy operations can increase Ethereum’s state too quickly, and block validation becomes slower and harder for nodes to keep up with. If one user submits a huge transaction that uses nearly all the gas (for example, a transaction that consumes 38 million gas in a 40 million–gas block), then other normal transactions cannot fit into the block, and every node must spend extra time verifying that block. This threatens network stability and decentralization because slower verification means weaker nodes fall behind. To solve this, Ethereum needs a safe upper limit on how much gas a single transaction can use, so block load becomes more predictable, DoS risk is reduced, and nodes have a more even workload.EIP-7825 introduces a hard rule that no transaction can use more than . This becomes a protocol-level cap, meaning it applies everywhere: when a user sends a transaction, when the txpool checks it, and when validators include it in a block. If someone sends a transaction with a gasLimit higher than this number, the client must reject it immediately with an error such as . This cap is completely independent of the block gas limit. For example, even if the block gas limit is 40 million, no single transaction is allowed to use above 16.7 million gas. The goal is to make sure that many transactions can fit inside each block instead of letting one transaction dominate the entire block.To understand this better, imagine a block has space for 40 million gas. Without this cap, someone could send a single transaction that consumes 35–40 million gas. That transaction would monopolize the block and leave no room for others, similar to one person renting out an entire bus so no one else can board. With the new 16.7M limit, the block will naturally hold multiple transactions and avoid this kind of abuse.The proposal also adds specific requirements to how clients validate transactions. The txpool must refuse a transaction if its gasLimit is above 16,777,216, meaning such a transaction never even enters the queue. During block validation, if a block contains a transaction that exceeds the cap, the block itself must be rejected. Internally, client implementations will cap the GAS_LIMIT parameter for all transactions at this value.The number  was chosen because it is a clean power-of-two boundary, making it easier to implement, and it is still large enough to handle most real-world transactions such as smart contract deployments, complex DeFi interactions, or multi-step contract calls. This value is roughly half of the typical block size, meaning even the most complex transactions should still fit comfortably within this limit.This EIP also maintains compatibility with current gas mechanics. Most users will never notice the change because nearly all existing transactions already consume far less than 16 million gas. Validators and block builders can still create blocks that exceed 16.7 million total gas, as long as each individual transaction respects the new cap. The only transactions affected are extremely large ones that previously attempted to use more than the new limit. Those transactions must now be split into multiple smaller operations—similar to breaking a very large file upload into two smaller ones. This change is technically not backward-compatible for those rare extreme transactions, but the number of users affected is expected to be very small.In terms of security, the gas cap makes Ethereum more resilient to gas-based DoS attacks because attackers cannot force validators to handle extremely large transactions anymore. It also helps keep block verification times predictable so that nodes can stay in sync more easily. The main edge case is that a few very large contract deployments may not fit under the cap and might need to be redesigned or split into multiple deployment steps.Overall, EIP-7825 is designed to strengthen the network against abuse, keep node requirements reasonable, improve fairness in block space usage, and ensure the chain remains fast and stable as gas limits continue to increase over time.The reason Ethereum needs this proposal is that the ModExp precompile (used for modular exponentiation) has been  compared to the actual resources it consumes. In some situations, ModExp operations require far more computation than what users are currently paying for. This mismatch creates a risk: if complex ModExp calls stay too cheap, they can become a  and make it harder for the network to safely increase the block gas limit, since block producers may be forced to process extremely heavy operations for very little cost. To fix this, Ethereum needs to adjust the ModExp pricing formula so that the gas used properly reflects the real work done by the client. That is why EIP-7883 introduces new rules that increase the minimum cost, raise the general cost, and make operations with large inputs (especially exponents, base, or modulus over 32 bytes) more expensive, so the gas pricing matches the true computation required.This proposal modifies the ModExp pricing algorithm originally defined in EIP-2565 by increasing the cost in several important ways. First, the  is raised from 200 to 500, and the general formula no longer divides by 3, meaning the total cost effectively becomes . For example, if a ModExp call previously cost 1,200 gas, it will now cost around 3,600 gas under the new formula. Second, the cost of operations with exponents larger than 32 bytes is doubled by increasing the multiplier from 8 to 16. To illustrate this: if the exponent length was 40 bytes, EIP-2565 would add  to the iteration count, while EIP-7883 now uses , making it twice as expensive. Third, the pricing now assumes a minimum base/modulus size of 32 bytes and sharply increases the computation cost when these values exceed 32 bytes. For example, if the modulus is 64 bytes, the new rule applies a doubled complexity () instead of the old simpler formula, reflecting the real cost of large-number arithmetic. Together, these changes ensure that small ModExp operations pay a fair minimum fee and large, heavy operations scale their cost properly with size.The proposal defines a new gas calculation function that updates the complexity and iteration count rules. The multiplication complexity now uses a default value of 16 for base/modulus lengths up to 32 bytes, and for larger inputs it switches to the heavier formula , where “words” is the number of 8-byte chunks. The iteration count is also updated so that exponents of 32 bytes or smaller use their bit length to determine complexity, but exponents larger than 32 bytes add a much larger penalty. This ensures that very large exponents, which are computationally expensive in practice, now have a much higher gas cost. Importantly, the minimum returned gas cost is enforced as 500 instead of the earlier 200, making even the simplest ModExp calls more realistically priced.The motivation behind these pricing increases comes from benchmarks showing many situations where the ModExp precompile was significantly underpriced. The revised formula raises small operations by , typical operations by around , and very large or unbalanced operations by much larger factors—sometimes more than —depending on how big the exponent, base, or modulus is. The intent is not to change how ModExp works, but to ensure that even in its most resource-intensive edge cases it no longer threatens network stability or prevents future increases to the block gas limit. Because this EIP changes how much gas ModExp requires, it is , but gas repricing has happened many times before in Ethereum and is well-understood.Test results show how significant the increases can be. About 99.69% of historical ModExp calls will now cost either 500 gas (up from 200) or three times their earlier price. But certain heavy test cases see huge increases. For example, in one “exp-heavy” test, the cost jumps from 215 gas to 16,624 gas—about —because extremely large exponents are now correctly priced. In another case involving a base-heavy operation, the cost goes from 1,026 to 94,448 gas, which reflects how big-number multiplication actually scales. These examples show why the old pricing formula wasn’t realistic and how the new one better matches computational reality.In terms of security, this proposal does not create new attack vectors or make any operation cheaper. Instead, it focuses on preventing an important risk: underpriced ModExp operations could make it possible for attackers to fill blocks with extremely heavy computations for very low cost. The only possible downside is that some ModExp operations might now become overpriced, but this is considered a far better outcome than the current underpricing problem. No interface changes or new functionality are introduced, so existing arithmetic behavior and test vectors remain valid.| Test Case | EIP-2565 Pricing | EIP-7883 Pricing | Increase |

Ethereum needed this proposal because the network’s proposer schedule for the next epoch was not fully predictable. Even though the RANDAO seed for epoch  is known during epoch , the actual proposer list could still change due to effective balance (EB) updates happening inside epoch . These EB changes can come from slashings, penalties, rewards above 1 ETH, validator consolidations, or new deposits—especially after EIP-7251 raised the maximum effective balance beyond 32 ETH. This uncertainty creates issues for systems that rely on knowing the next proposer in advance, such as based preconfirmation protocols, which need a stable and predictable schedule to operate smoothly. A validator could even try to “grind” or manipulate their effective balance to influence who becomes the proposer next epoch. Because of these problems, Ethereum needed a way to make the proposer schedule fully deterministic several epochs ahead so it cannot be changed by last-minute EB updates and can be easily accessed by the application layer.To implement this, the EIP introduces a deterministic proposer lookahead by pre-computing and storing the proposer schedule for the next MINLOOKAHEAD + 1 epochs at the start of every epoch. In simple terms, the beacon state now contains a list called  that always covers two full epochs of proposers - 64 slots in total. For example, when epoch N begins, this list already includes the proposer for every slot in epoch N and epoch N+1. Then, when the network moves to epoch N+1, the list is shifted forward: the proposer entries for epoch N are removed, the entries for epoch N+1 move to the front, and new proposer entries for epoch N+2 are added at the end. This makes the schedule fixed, predictable, and easy for clients to read directly, instead of recomputing proposers every slot.To keep this updated, the list shifts forward at every epoch boundary: the data for the past epoch is removed, and a new set of proposer indices for the next future epoch is computed and appended. The process uses the same seed and effective balance rules as before, but now the schedule is calculated earlier, removing the possibility of EB changes affecting it after the seed is known. The very first block after the fork also fills this entire lookahead range so that all future epochs have properly initialized schedules.Imagine each epoch has 8 slots instead of 32 (just for simplicity). Without this EIP, during epoch 5, you know the seed for epoch 6, but the actual proposer for slot 2 of epoch 6 could still change if a validator gets slashed or earns enough rewards to change their effective balance inside epoch 5. With EIP-7917, at the  of epoch 5, Ethereum pre-calculates all proposers for epoch 5, 6, and 7 and stores them in order inside . Now, even if balances change later in epoch 5, the proposer list for epoch 6 stays fixed and predictable.This EIP fixes a long-standing oversight in the beacon chain design. It guarantees that once the RANDAO from earlier epochs becomes available, the validator selection for future epochs cannot be altered. This also prevents “effective balance grinding,” where a validator tries to adjust their balance after seeing the RANDAO to influence the next epoch’s proposer list. With deterministic lookahead, that entire attack vector is eliminated, making the security analysis much simpler. It also gives consensus clients early visibility into who will propose upcoming blocks, which helps implementations and allows the proposer schedule to be easily verified by the application layer via a Merkle proof from the beacon root.The authors considered alternatives, such as caching the effective balances at the start of an epoch, but that would require extra storage and would not expose the schedule to the EVM. They also checked compatibility with future features like Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE). The current design remains compatible because the lookahead could one day store encrypted proposer IDs, or possibly be disabled entirely if SSLE removes lookahead, without breaking anything.Before this proposal, clients only calculated the proposer for the current slot. With EIP-7917, they now compute the proposer list for all slots in the next epoch at once during every epoch transition. This adds a small amount of work, but computing proposer indices is very light and mainly involves sampling validator lists using the seed. However, clients will need benchmarking to make sure this extra computation does not cause performance issues.This EIP does not change how the RANDAO delay works. The proposer lookahead for epoch  is still derived from the RANDAO of epoch . The only change is that effective balances are now aligned with the same delay, so validators cannot modify their EB after seeing the RANDAO result. This removes a potential manipulation strategy, even though no attack had been discovered yet. The deterministic lookahead therefore, strengthens security and prevents malicious alteration of proposer schedules.EIP-7918: Blob base fee bounded by execution costEthereum needs this proposal because the current blob fee system (from EIP-4844) breaks down when execution gas becomes the main cost for rollups. Right now, most rollups pay much more for execution gas (the cost of including their blob transaction in the block) than they pay for the actual blob fee. This creates a problem: even if Ethereum keeps lowering the blob base fee again and again, the rollup’s total cost does not really change, because the expensive part is still the execution gas. Because of this, the blob base fee keeps falling until it reaches the absolute minimum (1 wei), and the protocol can no longer use the blob fee to control demand. Then, when blob usage suddenly goes up, the blob fee needs many blocks to climb back to a normal level. This makes prices unstable and unpredictable for users.For example, imagine a rollup wants to post its data: it pays about 25,000,000 gwei in execution gas (25 gwei per gas for roughly 1,000,000 gas), while the blob fee is only around 200 gwei. This means the total cost is roughly 25,000,200 gwei, where almost the entire cost comes from execution gas, not the blob fee. If Ethereum keeps lowering the blob fee—say from 200 gwei to 50 gwei, then to 10 gwei, and eventually down to 1 wei—the total cost barely changes at all, staying almost exactly 25,000,000 gwei. Because users don’t feel any difference, they don’t change their behavior, so the protocol keeps pushing blob fees down until they hit the minimum possible value. Then, when blob demand suddenly increases again, the blob base fee has to climb all the way up from 1 wei, causing sharp, unpredictable fee spikes. EIP-7918 fixes this by introducing a minimum “reserve price” for blob fees that depends on the execution base fee, preventing blob prices from falling unrealistically low and keeping blob pricing much more stable and predictable for rollups.The core idea of EIP-7918 is simple: the price of a blob should never be cheaper than the cost of a certain amount of execution gas (called ). In the EIP, this constant is set to . The mechanism works through a small change inside the  function. Usually, this function increases or decreases the blob base fee depending on whether blocks are using more or less blob gas than the target. With this proposal, if a blob becomes “too cheap” compared to execution gas, the function stops subtracting the target blob gas. This makes the excess blob gas grow faster, which prevents the blob base fee from falling further. As a result, the blob base fee now has a minimum value equal to BLOBCOST × baseperPER_BLOB.To understand why this is needed, it helps to look at blob demand. A rollup cares about the total price it pays: execution cost plus blob cost. If execution gas fee is very high—for example, 20 gwei—then even if the blob fee drops from 2 gwei to 0.2 gwei, the total cost barely changes. This means reducing the blob base fee has almost no impact on demand. In economics, this is called “.” It creates a situation where the demand curve is almost vertical: lowering price does not increase demand. When this happens, the blob base fee mechanism becomes blind—it keeps lowering the price even though demand does not react. That is why the blob base fee often slides down to 1 wei. Then, when real demand increases later, the protocol needs an hour or more of nearly full blocks to raise the fee back up to a reasonable level. EIP-7918 fixes this by establishing a reserve price tied to execution gas so that blob fees remain meaningful even when execution costs dominate.Another reason for adding this reserve price is that nodes have to do a lot of extra work to verify the KZG proofs for blob data. These proofs are what guarantee that the data inside a blob actually matches its commitment. Under EIP-4844, a node only had to verify one proof per blob, which was cheap. But with EIP-7594 (PeerDAS), blobs are broken into many small pieces called cells, and every cell has its own proof. This makes verification much heavier. For example, the execution layer now has to batch-verify 128 proofs for every single blob before a transaction can even enter the mempool—this is about fifteen times more expensive than the normal KZG proof verification that smart contracts pay for. On top of that, full nodes, supernodes, and validators must verify even more proofs depending on how many columns they store or sample. A typical full node must verify proofs for all blobs in the mempool, plus eight sampled columns every slot, plus four columns it permanently custodies. All of this uses real CPU time, and it isn’t free for node operators. If blob fees drop too low, users would get this expensive compute work from the network essentially for free. By linking the blob reserve price to execution gas fees, EIP-7918 makes sure blob users always pay at least a fair minimum amount for the load they put on nodes.In the long run, EIP-7918 also helps prepare Ethereum for the future. As technology improves, the cost of storing and sharing data naturally gets cheaper, and Ethereum is expected to allow more blob data over time. When blob capacity increases, blob fees (in ETH) should naturally go down. This proposal supports that because the reserve price is tied to execution gas prices, not a fixed number, so it can adjust as the network grows. As both blobspace and execution blockspace expand, their price relationship stays balanced. The only time the reserve price might become too high is in a very unlikely future where Ethereum increases blob capacity a lot but does not increase execution gas capacity. In that case, blob fees might end up higher than needed. But Ethereum is not planning to scale in that way—both blobspace and execution blockspace are expected to grow together. Because of this, the chosen value () is considered safe and well-balanced.There is one small detail to understand when execution gas fees suddenly jump. Because the blob reserve price depends on the execution base fee, a sudden rise in execution costs can temporarily push blob fees into a state where execution fees are guiding them. For example, imagine execution gas suddenly jumps from 20 gwei to 60 gwei in one block. Since the reserve price for blobs is tied to that number, blob fees cannot drop below the new higher level. Blob fees will still increase normally if blobs are being used, but the protocol will not allow them to decrease until they have risen enough to match the higher execution cost. This means blob fees may climb more slowly than execution fees for a few blocks. This small delay is not harmful — it actually prevents sharp, sudden swings in blob prices and keeps the system smoother and more stable.The authors also performed empirical analysis by applying the reserve price rule to real blob activity from  and . During high-execution-fee periods (around ), the reserve threshold significantly increased the blob base fee compared to the old mechanism. During low-execution-fee periods (around ), the blob fee remained almost unchanged except when the calculated blob base fee dropped below the reserve price. By comparing thousands of blocks, the authors show that the new mechanism creates more stable pricing while still responding naturally to demand. A histogram of four months of blob fees shows that the reserve price prevents blob fees from collapsing toward 1 wei, which reduces extreme volatility.In terms of security, the change does not introduce any risks. The blob base fee will always settle at or above the cost of  units of execution gas. This is safe because the mechanism only raises the minimum fee, and setting a lower bound on pricing does not interfere with protocol correctness. It simply ensures healthy economics.EIP-7934: RLP Execution Block Size LimitBefore EIP-7934, Ethereum did  have a strict upper limit on how large an RLP-encoded execution block could be. In theory, a block could become extremely large if it contained many transactions or very complex data. This created two major problems:  and . If a block was too large, it would take longer for nodes to download and verify it, which slowed block propagation and increased the chance of temporary blockchain forks. Worse, an attacker could deliberately create a very large block to overload nodes, causing delays or even knocking them offline — a classic denial-of-service scenario. At the same time, Ethereum’s consensus layer (CL) gossip protocol already refused to propagate any block over , meaning oversized execution blocks could fail to spread across the network, creating fragmentation or nodes disagreeing on the chain. Because of these risks, Ethereum needed a clear, protocol-level rule to prevent oversized blocks and keep the network stable and secure.EIP-7934 solves this by introducing a  on the size of an RLP-encoded execution block. The maximum allowed block size () is set to 10 MiB (10,485,760 bytes), but because beacon blocks also consume some space (), Ethereum adds a . This means the actual maximum RLP-encoded execution block size allowed is MAX_RLP_BLOCK_SIZE = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE - SAFETY_MARGIN. If the encoded block is larger than this limit, the block is considered  and nodes must reject it. With this rule in place, block producers must check the encoded size of every block they build, and validators must verify this limit during block validation. This size cap applies  of gas limits -meaning even if a block is “” it can still be rejected if its encoded size is too large. This ensures that both gas usage and real byte-size constraints are respected.Choosing a  was intentional because it matches the existing constraint in the consensus layer gossip protocol. Anything larger than 10 MiB would not be broadcast across the network anyway, so this EIP brings the execution layer into alignment with the consensus layer’s limits. This creates consistency across all components and prevents situations where a valid execution block becomes “invisible” because the CL refuses to gossip it.This change is  with blocks larger than the new limit, meaning miners and validators must update their clients to respect the rule. However, since oversized blocks were already problematic and not normal in real operation, the impact is minimal. In terms of security, this EIP significantly strengthens Ethereum against targeted block-size DoS attacks by ensuring no participant can create blocks that overwhelm the network. Overall, EIP-7934 adds an important safety boundary, improves stability, aligns EL and CL behavior, and prevents several classes of attacks related to oversized block creation and propagation.EIP-7939: Count leading zeros (CLZ) opcodeBefore this EIP, Ethereum had  to count the number of leading zero bits in a 256-bit number. Developers had to implement CLZ manually in Solidity using many bit-shift operations and comparisons. This was a big problem because the custom implementations were , and , which increased gas usage. For zero-knowledge proving systems, the cost was even higher — right-shifts are extremely expensive to prove, so operations like CLZ slowed down ZK circuits significantly. Since CLZ is a very common low-level function used in math libraries, compression algorithms, bitmaps, signature schemes, and many cryptographic or data-processing tasks, Ethereum needed a faster and cheaper way to compute it.EIP-7939 solves this by introducing a new opcode called CLZ (0x1e). This opcode takes a 256-bit value from the stack and returns the number of leading zero bits. If the input number is zero, the opcode returns , because a 256-bit zero has 256 leading zero bits. This matches how CLZ works in many CPU architectures like ARM and x86, where this operation is native. Adding CLZ makes many algorithms significantly cheaper: operations like , , , various math functions, byte-string comparisons, bitmap scanning, calldata compression/decompression, and post-quantum signature schemes all benefit from faster leading-zero detection.The gas cost for CLZ is set to 5, similar to an , and slightly raised from the old MUL price to avoid underpricing the opcode and causing DoS risks. Benchmarks show that CLZ uses roughly the same compute effort as ADD, and in the SP1 rv32im proving environment, CLZ is actually cheaper to prove than ADD, reducing ZK proving costs. The EIP also explains why they chose CLZ instead of CTZ (count trailing zeros): you can compute CTZ from CLZ using , but you  reliably implement CLZ using CTZ, so CLZ is more fundamental.This EIP is fully backwards-compatible because it introduces a  opcode and does not modify any existing behavior. It also covers edge cases clearly: for example, the opcode returns 256 when the input is zero, and several test cases show inputs like all-zero, top-bit-set, and fully-nonzero values. Since CLZ has predictable and low gas cost, no memory growth, and no state changes, it is safe from denial-of-service issues.Overall, EIP-7939 makes Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more developer-friendly by adding a simple, efficient primitive that modern CPUs already support — cutting gas, reducing bytecode size, and lowering ZK proving costs for many common operations.Before this EIP, Ethereum did  have a safe, native way to verify digital signatures created using the . This curve is the standard used in modern devices like Apple Secure Enclave, Android Keystore, HSMs, TEEs, and FIDO2/WebAuthn security keys. Because of this missing support, apps and wallets could not easily use device-level hardware security for signing. There was an earlier attempt (RIP-7212), but it had two serious security vulnerabilities related to point-at-infinity handling and incorrect signature comparison. These issues could cause incorrect verification or even risk consensus failures. EIP-7951 fixes those security problems and introduces a safe, native precompile so Ethereum can finally support signatures from modern hardware securely and efficiently.EIP-7951 adds a new  at address  called , which performs ECDSA signature verification using the secp256r1 curve. This makes signature verification fast and cheap compared to implementing the algorithm directly in Solidity. The precompile uses the official curve parameters defined by NIST, including the field modulus, curve equation, base point, and subgroup order, ensuring strong cryptographic security. Points and scalars are encoded in strict 32-byte big-endian format, and a 64-byte all-zero value is used to represent the point at infinity. The precompile expects exactly —the hash, signature (r, s), and public key coordinates (qx, qy)—and it returns  for success or  for failure.The EIP also defines strict . It checks that r and s are within valid ranges, that the public key lies on the curve, and that it is not the point at infinity. If anything is invalid, the precompile returns failure without reverting and consumes the same gas as a successful call. The verification algorithm follows standard ECDSA: it computes s⁻¹ mod n, rebuilds the signing point R’, rejects if R’ is infinity, and finally checks whether the x-coordinate of R’ matches r (mod n). This corrects the mistake in RIP-7212, which compared r’ directly instead of reducing it mod n.The secp256r1 curve is fully defined by the following set of parameters:Base field modulus = p = 0xffffffff00000001000000000000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffff
Curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (mod p)
Curve coefficient a = 0xffffffff00000001000000000000000000000000fffffffffffffffffffffffc
Curve coefficient b = 0x5ac635d8aa3a93e7b3ebbd55769886bc651d06b0cc53b0f63bce3c3e27d2604b
Base point G:
  Gx = 0x6b17d1f2e12c4247f8bce6e563a440f277037d812deb33a0f4a13945d898c296
  Gy = 0x4fe342e2fe1a7f9b8ee7eb4a7c0f9e162bce33576b315ececbb6406837bf51f5
Subgroup order = n = 0xffffffff00000000ffffffffffffffffbce6faada7179e84f3b9cac2fc632551
Cofactor = h = 0x1
These parameters are standardized by NIST in SP 800-1861.The gas cost for the operation is set to , which is higher than the RIP-7212 version, but matches actual performance benchmarks for secp256r1 verification. Importantly, the interface remains fully compatible with Layer 2 networks that already deployed RIP-7212—same address, same input/output format—so existing smart contracts will continue to work with no changes. The only difference is the corrected behavior and higher gas cost.Input:
P256VERIFY call excepts 160 Bytes as input that is interpreted as byte concatenation of:
32 bytes  ----> message hash (h)
32 bytes  ----> signature component (r)
32 bytes  ----> signature component (s)
32 bytes  ----> public key x-coordinate (qx)
32 bytes  ----> public key y-coordinate (qy)
Output:
will be 32 bytes on successfull verification and 0 bytes on failure
Input Validation:
The precompile MUST perform the following validation checks and return `` (failure) if any check fails:
1. Input length: Input MUST be exactly 160 bytes
2. Signature component bounds: Both r and s MUST satisfy 0 < r < n and 0 < s < n
3. Public key bounds: Both qx and qy MUST satisfy 0 ≤ qx < p and 0 ≤ qy < p
4. Point validity: The point (qx, qy) MUST satisfy the curve equation qy^2 ≡ qx^3 + a*qx + b (mod p)
5. Point not at infinity: The point (qx, qy) MUST NOT be the point at infinity (represented as (0, 0))
From a security standpoint, the EIP restores proper ECDSA behavior, eliminates malleability concerns at the precompile level (leaving optional checks to applications), and clarifies that constant-time execution is not required for the precompile. The secp256r1 curve provides 128-bit security and is widely trusted and analyzed, making it safe for Ethereum adoption.In short, EIP-7951 is needed to safely bring modern hardware-backed authentication to Ethereum, fix the security issues of the earlier proposal, and provide a reliable, standardized way to verify P-256 signatures across the entire ecosystem.The table below summarizes which Ethereum clients need to implement changes for each Fusaka EIP. A check mark under  indicates that the EIP requires updates to consensus-layer clients, while a check mark under  shows that the change affects execution-layer clients. Some EIPs require updates in both layers, while others are specific to just one.| EIP Number | EIP Name | Consensus Client | Execution Client |
|----|----|----|----|
| EIP-7594 | PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling | ✅ | ✅ |
| EIP-7823 | Set upper bounds for MODEXP |    | ✅ |
| EIP-7825 | Transaction Gas Limit Cap |    | ✅ |
| EIP-7883 | ModExp Gas Cost Increase |    | ✅ |
| EIP-7917 | Deterministic proposer lookahead | ✅ |    |
| EIP-7918 | Blob base fee bounded by execution cost |    | ✅ |
| EIP-7934 | RLP Execution Block Size Limit |    | ✅ |
| EIP-7939 | Count leading zeros (CLZ) opcode |    | ✅ |
| EIP-7951 | Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support |    | ✅ |In summary, these are the key EIPs included in the Fusaka hard fork. While several improvements touch both consensus and execution clients—ranging from gas adjustments and opcode updates to new precompiles—the major change of this upgrade is PeerDAS, which introduces peer-to-peer data availability sampling, enabling more efficient and decentralized handling of blob data across the network.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wei Yi and Javokhir Sindarov reach the FIDE World Cup final and qualify for the Candidates tournament - 7</title><link>https://theweekinchess.com/twic-news-feed/wei-yi-and-javokhir-sindarov-reach-the-fide-world-cup-final-and-qualify-for-the-candidates-tournament</link><author>Mark Crowther</author><category>chess</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://theweekinchess.com/">Week in Chess</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AU and EU summit in Angola – chance for a change? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SrD0gk2QTN4</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SrD0gk2QTN4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 14:06:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Angola is hosting a two-day summit of the African Union and the European Union.

"The internet slipped inside almost every job and rewired how work got done." 

So while the number of single-task jobs like travel agent dropped, most jobs "are bundles of judgment, coordination and hands-on work," and instead the internet brought "the quiet transformation of nearly every job in the economy... Today, just 10% of workers make minimal use of the internet on the job — roles like butcher and carpet installer."

[T]he bigger story has been additive. In 1998, few could conceive of social media — let alone 65,000 social-media managers — and 200,000 information-security analysts would have sounded absurd when data still lived on floppy disks... Marketing shifted from campaign bursts to always-on funnels and A/B testing. Clinics embedded e-prescribing and patient portals, reshaping front-office and clinical handoffs. The steps, owners and metrics shifted. Only then did the backbone scale: We went from server closets wedged next to the mop sink to data centers and cloud regions, from lone system administrators to fulfillment networks, cybersecurity and compliance. 

That is where many unexpected jobs appeared. Networked machines and web-enabled software quietly transformed back offices as much as our on-screen lives. Similarly, as e-commerce took off, internet-enabled logistics rewired planning roles — logisticians, transportation and distribution managers — and unlocked a surge in last-mile work. The build-out didn't just hire coders; it hired coordinators, pickers, packers and drivers. It spawned hundreds of thousands of warehouse and delivery jobs — the largest pockets of internet-driven job growth, and yet few had them on their 1998 bingo card... Today, the share of workers in professional and managerial occupations has more than doubled since the dawn of the digital era. 



So what does that tell us about AI? Our mental model often defaults to an industrial image — John Henry versus the steam drill — where jobs are one dominant task, and automation maps one-to-one: Automate the task, eliminate the job. The internet revealed a different reality: Modern roles are bundles. Technologies typically hit routine tasks first, then workflows, and only later reshape jobs, with second-order hiring around the backbone. That complexity is what made disruption slower and more subtle than anyone predicted. AI fits that pattern more than it breaks it... [LLMs] can draft briefs, summarize medical notes and answer queries. Those are tasks — important ones — but still parts of larger roles. They don't manage risk, hold accountability, reassure anxious clients or integrate messy context across teams. Expect a rebalanced division of labor: The technical layer gets faster and cheaper; the human layer shifts toward supervision, coordination, complex judgment, relationship work and exception handling. 

What to expect from AI, then, is messy, uneven reshuffling in stages. Some roles will contract sharply — and those contractions will affect real people. But many occupations will be rewired in quieter ways. Productivity gains will unlock new demand and create work that didn't exist, alongside a build-out around data, safety, compliance and infrastructure. 
AI is unprecedented; so was the internet. The real risk is timing: overestimating job losses, underestimating the long, quiet rewiring already under way, and overlooking the jobs created in the backbone. That was the internet's lesson. It's likely to be AI's as well.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Shaders: How to draw high fidelity graphics with just x and y coordinates</title><link>https://www.makingsoftware.com/chapters/shaders</link><author>Garbage</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:26:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>G20 leaders issue declaration without US input after boycott | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6aXPJyZrHQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/m6aXPJyZrHQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:15:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa have issued a joint declaration addressing climate change and other global challenges, despite opposition from the United States, which is boycotting the meeting. 
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, the host of this year's summit, emphasized the significance of the first African G20 presidency. He also said there would not be a traditional handover to the US, which is due to take over as G20 president for 2026. That's after Washington announced it would only send an embassy official to Johannesburg.
South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola explained that the handover ceremony at the summit required officials at the approporiate level.

And what could possibly be wrong with such aspirations? Indeed, most company leaders and high-tech workers, in the Valley, genuinely believe they are “making the world a better place” while also making money.Silicon Valley is the progressive face of capitalism. We’ve experienced it, intimately. Billions of people, across the globe, enjoy real benefits from searching the world’s information, connecting with people across time and space, and carrying a supercomputers in their pockets. Silicon Valley doesn’t obviously throw workers into factories and mines for endless hours on low pay; such images are hidden, rendered distant by the supply chain . Instead, the Valley, in our imaginations, is populated by knowledge workers, a diverse and smart workforce that designs, solves, and codes in humane office spaces, with above average wages, ping pong, cafeterias, flexible working hours, sleeping cubicles. What’s not to like?We could consider the Valley’s hidden workers, those who clean, wait tables, wash cars, nanny, deliver packages, tend gardens, fix infrastructure for poverty wages; we could explore the trailer parks down the road from Google HQ, or document the shootings in the streets, the homeless that push shopping trolleys up and down the El Camino, their world a bundle of rags; or the gun shops that sell semi-automatics, the out-of-control, over-staffed police, armed with military-grade cast-me-downs, that regularly gun down the poor; the families crowded into small apartments, the father who spends his days scouring trash bins for recyclable bottles to trade for cash, the human trafficking of women, the prostitution, coerced to serve a predominately male workforce; or the disciplining and harassment of the undocumented, the deportations, the splitting up and destruction of families; or the local charities that collect food for kids, during seasonal holidays, since outside of school time their families cannot provide; or the extraordinarily high incarceration rates that control the surplus labour force, the armed guards on campuses and in schools, office complexes and shop interiors; or the poverty, the child who cannot concentrate in class since their teeth are rotting in their mouth, the extreme and devastating inequalities in wealth and income, the untreated illnesses and injuries, for lack of medical access, the widespread use of antidepressants, the addictions, the dispossessed, the broken dreams and the crying … Yet these symptoms of a broken and decaying society are studiously ignored, repressed, unmentioned by Silicon Valley’s middle and upper classes. Psychological repression is widespread amongst the highly paid of the Valley. It’s a defence: it’s just too damn painful to contemplate the full horror of social reality. And life can be organised to avoid it, or deny it. So many don’t even notice.I could mention all the evil business models, where vast computing power and fancy algorithms trawl our digital footprints to track and surveil, to sell and manipulate, to intensify our addictions; and we might reflect on the Valley’s enormous and continuing contributions to building military  machines that rain down death and destruction. Instead, here, in this article, I want to point to the root problem, the ultimate source of evil, and explain why Silicon Valley is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Valley’s movers and shakers believe they are progressive, that entrepreneurial capitalism is the road to utopia. But it’s not. In fact, the opposite is the case: the Valley is a cause of this horror, of the social ills, and the social breakdown that it must repress: it is both responsible and culpable for creating a dystopia.I want all the talented, hopeful, optimistic high-tech workers, who genuinely want to make the world a better place, who are about to found a new and exciting startup, to just take a short pause, to stop, look around, think, reflect and reconsider: the kind of firm you incorporate, the institutional rules you adopt, is precisely the choice point between doing evil and doing good.I will try to explain. My apologies if it takes a little while, since if the following facts were readily understood and generally accepted, then Silicon Valley would already be good, not evil, and I wouldn’t need to explain.Silicon Valley: midwife of the capitalist firmThe Valley is all about startups. They spring up all the time. New exciting and hopeful adventures. It’s like forming a band, but better.In huge, mature corporations the social relations of production are obscured by layers of hierarchy and absentee ownership. But in a startup the power relations are direct and visible, and often share an office with you. You can observe the basic unit of production in capitalism—the capitalist firm—as if under a microscope.Let’s lay out the property relations of a (slightly simplified) typical startup. The startup has owner(s), usually “high net worth” individuals, either directly present or indirectly in the form of venture capital firms. Venture capital provides the initial funds for the new venture. The actual founders, the ones with the ideas and talent, but no money, also part own the firm. The divvying up of the initial share issue between founders and early investors is a detail. The founders, armed with a new injection of capital, then recruit workers by convincing them of “the vision”. These are the first employees. And off we go. The owner(s) of the startup are in complete control, and their decisions are final. Owners can promote, demote, hire and fire anyone, at any time. Owners set wage levels, which are kept secret (and the workers, being earnest and highly disciplined, avoid this subject with each other—that would break a taboo). Startups are definitely not run on democratic lines: workers don’t get to appoint managers, set strategy, or distribute profits. Instead, the startup is a mini dictatorship: sure, there’s plenty of technical debate, and back-and-forth, and head scratching, but ultimately it’s a dictatorship.The owners pays all input costs—such as office rental, computers, electricity and heating, labour etc. They own all outputs, such as new software or hardware, and any inventions (which, in the Valley, are aggressively patented). The owners are liable for any profits and losses of the company. The startup’s bank accounts are hidden from the workers, and out of their control.This basic social relation—between profit-taking capitalist owners and wage-earning workers—is constitutive of capitalism. For example, today you can travel to Shropshire, England, and visit Ironbridge village, one of the birthplaces of the industrial revolution and “the silicon valley of the 1800s”. You can tour an early ironworks and see the great furnaces where workers toiled, the tiny administrative office (to dole out wages, and keep accounts), and nearby, on a large hill overlooking the site, the capitalists’ large and imposing mansions.The form may have changed, but not the content. In this sense, Silicon Valley is deeply conservative. It proclaims to disrupt everything, and make all fresh, new and shiny—except this basic social relationship.Almost all Silicon Valley workers accept these social relations as entirely natural, acceptable, and pretty much fair and equitable. The owners fund the company. They therefore “own the firm”. The owners risk a lot of capital, and the workers receive a good wage, based on supply and demand in the marketplace, plus some ramp-up time to try and invent new stuff, which is fun. What’s not to like? What’s the problem?Silicon Valley: it’s theft all the way downStartups reproduce, in embryo form, the wage system, where the capitalist owner hires-in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. In a capitalist firm, labour is just an another  cost of production. The workers mix their labour with inputs and produce an output for sale. Normally, firms sell at prices that exceed their costs of production, which includes the cost of used-up inputs, rent, interest on capital loans, and wage costs etc. Any residual income then gets distributed as profit to the owner, or owners, of the firm.Imagine that you and I agree to exchange something in the marketplace, say a second-hand iPhone on Ebay. You get the money, I get an iPhone. You may get a good deal, or I may get a good deal, depending on our “higgling and haggling” in the marketplace. Whether a fair price is struck, or not, there’s an exchange of something for something: some goods for some money. This social transaction satisfies a “principle of exchange”. We’ve swapped stuff, and no-one forced us to.But let’s say I just took the iPhone from you. And you received no money at all. This violates the principle of exchange. I got something for nothing: some goods, some resources, for free. That’s theft. Obviously so.All startups in Silicon Valley violate the principle of exchange and institute a system of theft. They are theft-based institutions. If the startup is successful and grows, so does the theft, since theft is baked into the institutional structure of the firm, right from the get go. If the startup goes global, like an Apple, Facebook, or Google, then the cancer spreads and the theft takes place on a global scale.But the theft is hidden. We need some reflection to really see it.The workers in a startup are the actual cause of any profits it makes. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment: imagine the workers stopped working. Would the firm have any possibility of making a profit, or if already profitable, continue to make that profit? But we don’t need to imagine. This is called a strike. And owners hate it, since it kills their profit.So, in any company, including a startup, the workers create the value. What, then, do the owners contribute or create?The owners, or venture capitalists, contribute capital. They advance money to fund the startup until it (hopefully) starts making money. And then they expect a return. Since they’ve given something they should definitely get something back, otherwise we violate the principle of exchange. In fact, they should expect repayment of the sums advanced and—let’s be generous here—also a risk premium (since most startups fail without making profit) and, also—in order to be really straight and fair about this—some collateral as security (such as first dibs on any outstanding assets if the venture fails). This seems like a fair exchange.But if early investors merely did this—that is, simply advance some —they would not become the owners of the firm. Once the startup made money, the loan would be repaid (by the firm), and the early investors would have no further claims on the fruits of others’ labour (that is the value created by the workers).The important point is this: loan capital does not violate the principle of exchange.But Silicon Valley startups are not funded by loan capital. Venture capitalists want, and get, much more than this. They advance capital to a firm, but in addition to being repaid, they demand ownership of the firm, i.e. , and receive stock (shares in the firm). And so they “own the firm”. In consequence, once their initial loan and risk premium is repaid, they get even more: they retain a claim on the firm’s future income, that is the fruits of others’ labour  (or until the firm dissolves, or they sell their shares etc.)And the mere legal ownership of a firm is  to lay claim on its profit. And, right here, is precisely the moment when the principle of exchange is violated. Once the firm repays its debt then the early investors are now made whole. Beyond this point, we have workers creating profits, and owners appropriating that profit without needing to contribute an hour of their time, or a dime from their pockets. The owners are getting something for nothing. The owners can, as John Stuart Mill put it: “grow richer, as it were in their sleep”. There’s no exchange. Just appropriation. And that is what’s commonly, and accurately, called economic exploitation.The important point is this: equity capital violates the principle of exchange. Sometimes the meaning of a social situation can suddenly flip. You notice something new, like an object in the wrong place, or a small inconsistency that points to a secret, or a lie. This is one of those occasions. There’s an enormous difference between  capital to a firm, and  a firm. This vital distinction is conspicuously absent from all the upbeat, world-changing, and progressive chit-chat in the coffee shops, restaurants, offices and homes of Silicon Valley. So let’s pretend they might be listening, that all their chatter stops, just for a moment, and we whisper into each and every individual ear: . When you take profits, but contribute  to the output of a firm, other than holding a paper claim, you are stealing.Yet this is how startups in Silicon Valley are organised. Cohort after cohort of “smart” groups of highly educated workers are quite happy to sign up to their own exploitation, and cede control over how they organise their working day, and what they produce. The most effective prison is the one you don’t realise you’re in.But hold on. Look, we’ve woken the libertarian consciousness of Silicon Valley, and its rationality is strong and terrible: those that were whispered to have been stirred, and they reply, in unison: No-one forces workers to accept these terms, and the wage contract is voluntary, and therefore perfectly OK! Go away, annoying socialist, and stop spoiling our fun!Silicon Valley: forcing people to sell their labourDo workers freely enter into the wage contract? Do founders, with great ideas, have the freedom to start new commercial ventures that aren’t based on theft? To answer, let’s first define non-exploitative social relations of production.In principle, Silicon Valley startups could be incorporated as profit-sharing worker cooperatives. In this type of institution, all working members share the profit, which is democratically distributed. So if you join the co-op, you get a say, and you get profit shares. If you leave, you don’t anymore. The firm is collectively owned by its current working members.Worker co-ops don’t hire in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. They do the opposite. They hire-in capital at a pre-agreed rental price (i.e., raise loan capital  equity capital). So capital, not labour, is merely another  cost of production with no claim on the residual income of the firm.In a democratic worker co-op, the principle of exchange is not violated, and no-one systematically exploits others and steals the value they (jointly) created. Clearly, this is a more lucrative deal for workers: profit-sharing is better than a wage. So why doesn’t this happen in the Valley? Why don’t lots of workers incorporate worker co-ops? There are some carrots and a stick.The carrot: join us, join us!High-tech workers, especially those with in-demand skills, get more than wages, they get stock options.A stock option bestows the right to purchase company shares at a (very low) predefined price. You have to work, normally for many years, before you can exercise that right. The aim is worker retention, and align incentives so workers are motivated to create profits “for the company”. Stock options, in a sense, automatically bestow the material benefits of trade unionism without the need to organise. Any worker is, of course, glad of this potential source of additional income.But stock options, when exercised, are equity capital and confer (part) ownership of the firm: and, as we’ve seen, that fundamentally means participating in theft. Stock options, therefore, invite a section of the working class to join the elevated ranks of the capitalist class, and start exploiting others’ labour. (In practice, most stock options turn out worthless, since most new ventures fail. But it’s the hope that motivates).In a small startup, as is common in Silicon Valley, it’s especially clear that the workers create all the added value. But the owner(s) appropriate it. So even the best educated minds start to notice. And this doesn’t seem entirely fair. So stock options function to muddy the waters, and paper over the inconvenient truth of exploitation.So that’s one carrot, which pushes high-tech workers to sign-up to a capitalist firm. But there are more. If a group of workers decide to incorporate a new venture then, unless they are highly politically conscious and especially moral creatures, they will incorporate a capitalist firm, not a worker co-op. Why? Because you’ll definitely make more money by owning a firm, paying others wages, and keeping the profit to yourself.Many startup founders in Silicon Valley know they’re ripping off the workers they employ. They might soothe their guilt by pointing out they offer stock options, or throw themselves into libertarianism, which conveniently coincides with their material interests. But it’s a fact that stock is normally heavily concentrated amongst a few early founders and venture capitalists. As time goes on, the founders contributions are eclipsed by the hired workers, and then it’s just exploitation all down the line. The company is bought-out, the founders get their initial advances and more, and therefore cash in, and make their millions. But, in almost all cases, they did not contribute to the creation of that value—they stole it from the workers they hired.So the wage contract is sweetened by stock options. That works. But the contract is only voluntary if the workers have other options, if they have a choice. Do they?The stick: reproduce capitalism or wither and dieBut there are sticks too, which remove all choice, and prevent founders from incorporating worker co-operatives, even if they were sufficiently politically conscious to want to. Silicon Valley is famous for its vibrant and extensive venture capital community. Plenty of capital swills around, continually searching, like Sauron’s great eye, for the latest hit company to fund, and therefore own and exploit the efforts and creativity of hundreds and thousands of workers.Any venture capitalist, quite naturally, wants to maximise their returns. So, if faced with a choice between funding two companies, A and B, where A is a capitalist firm, and therefore offers equity in return for capital, whereas B is a worker co-op, and only offers interest repayments in return for capital, then the venture capitalist will always opt to fund A. No contest. Equity capital is strictly a better deal than loan capital. (And it’s not just more money, but also top-down dictatorial control of the company’s direction, and the working conditions and wage levels of employees. And being powerful is much more fun than being powerless. It’s great for the ego.)Hence worker co-ops don’t get funded in Silicon Valley, and never will. So all those talented and creative workers, with good ideas for making things that people want, have no choice but to incorporate a capitalist firm, and begin sorting people into a class of owners, and a class of workers.I witnessed an especially ugly example at an Silicon Valley business conference. An “Angel Investor” (someone who provides early seed capital) presented a talk about the criteria they apply when deciding which new ventures to invest in, and therefore what aspiring founders should do in order to maximise their chances of raising capital. A big factor, for the Angel, was that founders also raise money from friends and family, since “the desire to not disappoint loved ones is a great stimulant to hard work”. The Angel gave examples of “great stories” about teams they’d funded and the great returns made “by everybody”. At the close the Angel invited any founders in the audience to come and pitch their ideas to him—right there and then.A line of about twenty or so young people formed in front of the Angel, desperate to get funding for their cherished ideas. And there it was, like a frozen scene from a perverted nativity: an anointed minority of one, with the monopoly on capital, and an unwashed majority, full of aspirations and creativity, lining up, cap-in-hand, to proffer the sacrifice of equity in their newborn, and surrender themselves to exploitation.There was no choice, there is no choice: either submit to capital or watch your ideas wither and die. There are no other practical ways to raise significant capital. Real Angels don’t exist: those that ask only for their loan to be repaid, and not ownership of the firm; who reject the social relationship of equity capital, and therefore only invest in new ventures that incorporate as democratic worker-owned co-ops, so that all profit is shared, according to actual merit and contribution. If such fabled beings were present, the line before them would have been much, much longer.There is no choice. Founders must incorporate capitalist firms, and must rent-in labour. And workers, who need income, don’t have the option to join a worker co-op. They must sign the wage contract. This isn’t voluntary, it’s coerced—by those with the monopoly on capital.Silicon Valley culture celebrates venture capital, the Schumpeterian heroic entrepreneur, the dynamism of capitalism, and the gee-whiz technical and creative ideas of startup founders. But Silicon Valley repeatedly and continually reproduces exploitation, where some members of the firm own it, and others simply rent their labour to it. There’s zero innovation or disruption in this sphere. The Valley is a great engine, churning out new companies, day after day, which reproduce the division between an economic class that wins, and an economic class that loses.Economic inequality has always been around. But notably, in the last 30 years or so, economic inequality, in the rich countries, has significantly increased. So we find people at the bottom struggling for food and shelter, while those at the top earn many years worth of the average salary while they sleep. The majority in the middle work hard yet lack savings, living their entire lives a few paychecks from destitution.Things have got so bad that even mainstream discourse has shifted to reflect the new reality. We’re routinely told that millennials face low wages, poor quality jobs, high debt, and worse economic outcomes compared to their parents. People now accept that the political system is rigged by a rich elite who’ve captured the institutions of the nation state. And even the arch conservative world of academic economics talks about inequality. And that simply didn’t happen as recently as ten years ago.Bourgeois thinkers struggle to explain the major cause of economic inequality, because to do requires thinking deeply about property relations and the issue of systematic exploitation. Instead, they prefer to think about unequal human capital endowments, taxation policies, interest and growth rates, the saving habits of workers, rising costs in child and health care, or the impact of automation. They’ll think about anything and everything except the actual reason for inequality.Capitalist firms, in an important sense, are social machines, institutions that operate within the context of a market economy to “sort” individuals into different classes by means of the wage system. This sorting produces a very specific income and wealth distribution, which is peculiar to capitalism. Empirically, capitalist societies exhibit two distinct regimes: a lognormal distribution of wage income, and a Pareto distribution of profit income.In any dynamic society, with a continual reallocation of the division of labour as new skills are demanded and other skills are automated or changed, we should expect some level of wage inequality due to mismatches between supply and demand in the labour market. Also, some jobs are terrible and dangerous, and people should get more for risking more. And some people really do contribute more within the workplace, and its OK if they get additional awards from their peers, if only to make sure they stick around. And some people actually need more, perhaps due to illness or disabilities or additional domestic responsibilities. All this is fine.But, empirically, we see more than wage inequality. We see two distinct regimes. We see a majority earning wages, at the bottom of the scale, and a minority taking profits, at the top of the scale. Capitalist societies produce extreme inequalities where the top 10% or so take a big and disproportionate slice of the social pie.And the reason is obvious, for those willing to look: the major cause of economic inequality is the wage system itself. The more workers a capitalist exploits the more profit they make. The more profit they make the more workers they can exploit. And capitalists in the super-rich bracket enjoy positive feedback effects. They can hardly lose. The economic game is entirely rigged in their favour. And, in this elevated state, they fall asleep, wake up the next morning, having earned more than workers do in their entire lifetimes.In fact, the inequality between capitalists far exceeds the inequality between workers. The super-rich become astronomically rich as we bounce along the power-law tail of the Pareto distribution. The astronomically rich capture ostensibly democratic institutions, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in the USA, so that even mild social reforms are off the table. We’ve seen a collection of post-war policies, that once mitigated economic inequality, ditched in the last thirty years or so. This is why things have got even worse. Economic exploitation has increased.Extreme economic inequality causes untold misery. At the top we see excessive and wasteful hyper-consumption. At the bottom, countless everyday struggles to live a dignified life. All the social ills of Silicon Valley, many of which are hidden in plain sight, are suffered mostly by the poorly paid, those with the least money. But inequality affects everyone. Societies with high Gini coefficients do worse on almost all measures of social well-being.But it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s imagine an impossible event, just for the sake of illustrating a point. Imagine that all the people we whispered to—in the cafes, the offices and homes of Silicon Valley—actually listened, and decided, right there and then, to abolish exploitation, and resolved, with great determination, to only ever incorporate worker co-ops, and only lend capital, and never demand equity, then—with one decisive and unlikely step—Silicon Valley would actually begin to do good. Because it’s at this precise pivotal moment—the birth of a new productive unit—that a society’s social relations of production either get reproduced, or changed. For once you start to abolish the wage contract, and the renting of human beings, you start to abolish economic classes and extreme income inequality. Wealth would then start to be shared more equitably, and fairly, upon the principle of exchange, according to actual contributions to production, and not specious paper claims. The Pareto upper-regime would lose its material basis, would totter and fall, and therewith all the power that goes with it, the ability to capture and corrupt democracies and run them for the benefit of a privileged and undeserving few. The majority of the population would have more, enjoy more, and live better.You know, perhaps some really gifted entrepreneurs could figure out a way to export this culture, and good social outcomes, to the rest of the world. Silicon Valley: bullshit progressivismBut sadly, as of today, that is a dream. And it’s not even a dream that’s widely shared. Silicon Valley does not see the connection between the kinds of firms it funds and creates, and the kinds of social ills that surround it.But why single out Silicon Valley? What I’ve just described applies to capitalism in general.
Silicon Valley deserves especial opprobrium because the contradiction between its self-image and its reality is particularly stark. Silicon Valley desperately, desperately wants to view itself, and be seen as, socially progressive, enlightened, cutting-edge and, yes, utopian.But despite the explosion of ideas and firms, and the progressive rhetoric, the core propositions of capitalism are completely untouched, inviolate. The coupling of radical technical experimentation, with extreme conservation of capitalist property relations, has been a very successful recipe for the Valley’s elite.But the very startups that want to “change the world for the better” immediately reproduce economic exploitation: they separate human beings into a class that must rent their labour, and a class that appropriates the fruits of that labour; a class that is disciplined and must do as they are told in the workplace, and a class that disciplines and commands without democratic control. Every time an optimistic and earnest group of workers, with some great ideas, incorporate a startup and issue equity, any progressive content of those ideas are irreparably harmed.Yet this is the specific evil that Silicon Valley does: it funnels the progressive content of technical utopianism (the increase in the forces of production) into institutions that exploit workers on a global scale, and contribute to extreme economic inequality (the existing social relations of production). Silicon Valley helps produce the dystopia we live in. It doesn’t change the world for the better. It makes it worse, every single day.The narcissistic self-image of Valley culture contributes to its political backwardness. Some workers celebrate a victory when corporate HR departments commit to diversity in the workplace, or promise to address the gender pay gap. But these are easy concessions for capitalism, softballs, and the owners of your firm will happily accommodate you. Just don’t ask for bottom-up democracy in the workplace, or profit-sharing. Try it. You’ll get a very different response.But that’s what I do wish for. And I’m talking to you now, fellow workers of the Valley! If you really want to do no evil, to be good, disrupt the status quo and make the world a better place, then don’t create a capitalist firm: it’s a top-down dictatorship, where the dictators steal the money. There’s nothing progressive about this kind of social institution. Founding such a startup is deeply unethical, represents institutionalised theft, and is a prime cause of diverse social ills. Instead, use your talents to create democratic worker-owned cooperatives, based on equality among its working members; or help think of creative ways to solve the political problem of capitalists’ monopoly on capital. Abolishing economic exploitation genuinely makes the world a better place. Reproducing it in your startup does not.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Glibc Math Code Sees 4x Improvement On AMD Zen By Changing FMA Implementation</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Glibc-4x-FMA-Improvement-Zen</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 11:31:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Merged this week to the GNU C Library "glibc" code is dropping the ldbl-96 FMA implementation from this library as in doing so they found a 4x improvement to throughput and latency on AMD Zen 3 hardware...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe Today: Your new morning show, live from Brussels</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNZF8ZMWk0</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IcNZF8ZMWk0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 11:15:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every morning at 8 am Brussels time, you can join Euronews’ chief anchor Méabh Mc Mahon and our EU editor Maria Tadeo, who will bring you up to speed on the major news events of the day in our new daily show “Europe Today”.

He asked something about whether or not Signal is truly secure and private, like if it was safe from US government surveillance. I told him: “Well, it’s end-to-end encrypted, so they don’t know  we’re talking about, but they definitely know that we’re talking to each other.”I said that because Signal uses our phone numbers as ID’s. So, Signal would know that Phone Number A is talking to Phone Number B, and if they can figure out that Phone Number A belongs to me, and Phone Number B belongs to my buddy (usually not too hard to figure out with some OSINT or the assistance of certain governments), then Signal would know that my buddy and I are talking, even if they don’t know what we’re talking about.This is a limit of end-to-end encryption, which I’ve talked about before. End-to-end encryption provides confidentiality of data, but not anonymity or protection from identifying metadata.However, I was surprised when my friend got back to me saying that, no, Signal actually doesn’t know who’s talking to who because of this feature called “Sealed Sender“.“Woah! Seriously?! Cool!” I thought. But then I started reading how Sealed Sender actually works, according to none other than Signal themselves, and I found that this feature is very technically complex, and .ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Woah! Seriously?! Not cool!One-way anonymity for two-way communicationsWhile Sealed Sender is pretty complicated under the hood, the result of it is one-way anonymity. That means that, when Phone Number A sends a message to Phone Number B, Signal won’t know that the message is coming from Phone Number A and will only know that the message is to be delivered to Phone Number B.It does this in a way that’s very similar to snail mail without a return address: the letter inside the mail envelope might tell the recipient who the sender is, but the mail envelope itself tells the post office only who the recipient is so that it can be delivered to them. If the post office doesn’t or can’t open the envelope to read the letter itself, then they don’t know who the sender is. Later on, when the recipient wants to send a reply to the sender, they can do the same thing.ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, okay. This kind of sounds like it’s anonymous.Well, yes, it sort of is, but only when there’s only one message to be sent. The problem comes up when multiple messages are being sent back-and-forth like this.Sticking with the snail mail analogy, what happens when two pen pals keep sending mail to each other from their homes without including return addresses in their envelopes? The postal service might not know who exactly is sending each piece of mail but, over time, they would know that Address A in Lower Manhattan, New York, keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 3630 East Tremont Avenue, , New York; and  keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 350 Canal Street, .ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Oh. Then the postal service would be pretty sure that whoever is living at Address A and Address B are talking to each other.Exactly. That’s the limitation of one-way anonymity:  Once you start doing two-way communications, with replies going back-and-forth, then one-way anonymity is useless.With multiple messages being sent back-and-forth over time, and with Signal knowing only the recipient phone number of each message, it would be pretty hard for Signal to figure out who’s talking to who when their servers are getting thousands of messages every second from different senders, with each message being conveyed to thousands of different recipients. But, Signal doesn’t know only the recipient phone number of each message; they also know the IP address of each sender. And this is where the snail mail analogy fails, because IP addresses are  than post offices.Signal messages, as we all know, get sent over the internet, and the internet sends data around using IP addresses. Sealed Sender only protects the sender’s phone number; it does not protect the sender’s IP address. So, if you’re sending Signal messages to your super secret pen pal from your house, and you aren’t using a VPN or Tor, then Signal knows that the messages being sent to your pen pal’s phone number are coming from your house’s IP address (not a post office, your house).Even if you are using some method of masking your real IP address, you still have to use  IP address in order to communicate on the internet, and Signal will see that the same IP address keeps on sending messages to the same phone number. That’s enough to easily figure out that all of these different messages meant for the recipient are coming from the same sender. Sure, maybe you’re using the IP address of a VPN server or Tor exit node that has other Signal users sending messages at the same time, but that’s extremely unlikely. More likely: Even when you use a VPN or Tor, Signal can easily tell that every Sealed Sender message you’re sending to your pen pal are coming from one person: you.And if your pen pal replies, the reply will have his IP address on it (the same IP address Signal sent your messages to) and your phone number on it. And then, when you want to receive the reply, you have to connect to Signal’s servers using, again, your IP address (the same IP address you used to send your messages to your pen pal earlier). Just like that, with two messages, Signal figured out which phone number (yours) is talking to which other phone number (your pen pal’s). If they ever decide to try and figure out who own these two phone numbers, they could ask your telecoms, or simply search Facebook and Twitter.You can’t avoid using IP addresses on the internet; they are a necessity on the internet. But you can use a VPN or Tor to mask your real IP address with a fake one that’s not tied to your identity. But you can’t do that with phone numbers. A phone number is either tied to your identity or it isn’t; there is no masking possible, unless you use a service like MySudo which isn’t available for most of us (US and Canada only, as of this writing). If you’re fortunate enough to be able to buy a prepaid SIM without ID, then great, all you and your pen pal have to do is buy some SIM cards that aren’t tied to your identities. If buying a prepaid SIM without ID ain’t an option, then your phone number has to be tied to your identity, and Signal can use these unmasked phone numbers, in combination with masked or unmasked IP addresses, to figure out who’s talking to who, despite Sealed Sender’s promises, as long as there’s a two-way conversation going on.Which brings up an interesting question: Why does Signal require phone numbers?ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Hey, that is an interesting question…Signal works over the internet, and the internet requires IP (internet protocol) addresses in order to figure out where a message should go. But sending messages over the internet  require phone numbers; that’s a requirement when using SMS or cellular calls or mobile data, but not for using the internet. And yet, the “privacy-protecting” Signal app requires you to use a phone number to send and receive messages…It’s always a two-way streetIt gets worse. I keep repeating this: . Sealed Sender doesn’t work with . But, I’ve kind of been lying. The truth is: Signal already knows which phone numbers have been talking to which, even with Sealed Sender and only one-way communication.Do these check marks look familiar to you? (Forgive the pixelation.)ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, yeah. Aren’t they the check marks that show up for at least a second whenever I send a Signal message? This is what’s shown after the lone check mark, and before they both turn white to indicate that my message was read, right?That’s right. The lone check mark indicates that your Signal message was sent to Signal’s servers, these two check marks above indicate that your Signal message has been delivered to the recipient, and the two white check marks indicate that the recipient has read your Signal message.Now, the thing about the two check marks above is that your Signal app only shows them when your phone has received what’s called a “delivery receipt” from the recipient’s phone. Whenever your pen pal gets a message from you, their Signal app sends a delivery receipt from their phone, through Signal’s servers, to your phone. Their Signal app does this automatically and instantly, and neither of you can turn it off. You can turn off read receipts (the two white check marks) and typing indicators, but you can’t turn off the : delivery receipts.The delivery receipt is –  – also “protected” using Sealed Sender, but what was it that I’ve been saying this whole time is wrong with Sealed Sender?ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: It works only one-way…ʕ   • ᴥ •   ʔ: It works only one-way…ʕ   º ᴥ º   ʔ: …and the delivery receipt automatically makes it two-way.Exactly. And you can’t turn it off. Go figure why.Some alternatives and a work in progressSo if you can’t trust Signal, who can you trust? Well, if all you need is a private text-based communication channel that won’t falsely advertise their privacy guarantees to you, Proton Mail and Tutanota (now called Tuta) are pretty good. But if you want private voice-based communication, then that’s gonna’ be a problem. WhatsApp is even worse than Signal, Telegram is even worse than WhatsApp, Wire requires an email address to use it (another unnecessary requirement), and most of the rest can’t be trusted because they aren’t open-source.You could use Jitsi for voice communications, but you’d have to use a separate service for text communications. You could use Matrix for both text and voice, but that’s a software and communication protocol, so you’d have to set up your own server running it. You could use Element, which runs Matrix servers, but you’d have to trust Amazon and Cloudflare with your metadata, making this a rather messy solution to a privacy problem.What that leaves us with is a single service that is still a work in progress: SimpleX. It asks for no global identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses. It at least tries, unlike Signal, to make sure that it doesn’t know who’s talking to who. It does this with the use of proxies that you randomly send your messages through to get to your recipient (the technical details of which are too complicated to get into here). Of course it is open-source and end-to-end encrypted, otherwise I wouldn’t be mentioning it. It even goes so far as to  with it, or any SOCKS proxy. It’s pretty cool, actually; the most technically amazing communications platform I’ve ever seen.But, it ain’t perfect. It’s kinda’ slow, and messages sometimes don’t come in in the right order or don’t come in at all. Voice calls are… iffy, particularly when using Tor. It is still a young, developing project, though it has been making great strides in improving itself, including getting a security audit.Time will tell how it turns out, but at least I can say one thing: we’ve got a viable alternative.ʕ •̀ᴥ•́ ʔ: Where have you been for the past 11 months?!I actually started writing this article months ago and then got busy again.ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Well at least visit me with some tips and tricks every once in a while.I’ll try, buddy, but real life comes first before imaginary friends.ʕ •̀ᴥ•́ ʔ: I know I’m imaginary, but are your subscribers?I dunno’. Maybe they should give me a hint by signing up below!Or don’t; my RSS feed’s in the site menu. Unlike Signal, I don’t need you to sign up with a global identifier.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COP30 seals climate deal that sidesteps phase-out of fossil fuels | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhX89sNo-uw</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yhX89sNo-uw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 09:12:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Delegates at the United Nations climate change conference in Brazil have agreed on a compromise climate deal that sees more funding for poor nations coping with extreme weather.

Until now, I’ve pretty much exclusively been using the community-developed orgzly-revived app on Android. My intention was to use orgzly-revived for simple todo management and another app for more note-taking purposes—but I could never find another app I was happy with on Android. But I happened to remember reading good things about the  Emacs app on Android a few months ago. So I tried it out… and was immediately sold!The good and bad: what to expect on AndroidFirst, let’s make sure our expectations are tempered: Emacs on Android won’t be as pleasant as the full desktop experience. Of course. A phone’s screen is tiny, and unless you have a physical keyboard connected, you’ll have to manage with a virtual one (see Use a Special virtual keyboard). On top of that:To have non-Emacs programs available, you have to install Emacs in a particular way with Termux to expose Termux’s binaries to Emacs. (See the recommended way to install Emacs.) The initial set up is longer, but it’s worth it.Android “sandboxes” each app. You can think of each app having their own “section” of the file system that they can read or write to (unless they are given explicit access to that outside directory; see info "(emacs) Android Document Providers"). As such, one finds themselves fiddling with the obnoxiously long Android file paths if they want to, for instance, access their notes directory that is outside the Emacs app sandbox. This is a minor inconvenience though.Relatively speaking, writing to the file system can be long sometimes. Not too long, but long nonetheless, As far as I’ve experienced, this has only been the case when saving files that are outside the Emacs sandbox.So, really, the situation is pretty good!And finally: YMMV on other Android devices. My current phone is the OnePlus 7 Pro running Android version 12.The first option is as easy as it can get, but you won’t have a way to access other CLI tools:Download the F-droid app store. For the layperson who doesn’t know what it is: it’s basically an alternative to the Play Store. Some apps that can’t be on the Play Store (fact check, maybe link tk) are there.Open Emacs! The version of Emacs as I write this that is available is Emacs 30.1.Using Emacs this way is totally possible if all you need is elisp. But if you need other tools, like git, I recommend the second way to install Emacs.This option makes other CLI tools accessible to the Emacs Android application container. It is a little bit more of a hassle.The method is outlined in this SourceForge repository. In essence, inside the  directory of this SourceForge repository are modified Emacs .apk files. These .apk files allow the Emacs app container to access the Termux (explain what Termux is tk) app container, meaning the CLI tools installed with Termux will become accessible to Emacs. But the installation is specific; read the instructions detailed inside that repository. I will outline them briefly below, but be careful if you are reading this in the future, for the instructions could have changed relevantly.Delete any existing Emacs or Termux apps.Ensure you have enabled the setting that allows you to install third-party apps (i.e., non-Play Store apps) on your phone.Install Termux. Don’t open Termux yet.Select the .apk file appropriate to your phone. There are various .apk files for different versions of Emacs and devices.Install Emacs through this .apk. (If your phone refuses to install the .apk, you might have selected the wrong type of .apk file for your device. So try different .apk files for the same Emacs version.)In Termux, run . Say “yes” to each of the prompts.Create a  and place the following inside of it:And you’re done! Programs installed through Termux will be made accessible to Emacs.Configuring an Android-specific EmacsNecessary reading: the manualChances are that you don’t know that the Emacs manual has its own section for the Android system: . Before anything, I highly recommend you peruse this section, returning to and reading more deeply specific parts as you see fit. In particular, I found the following Info nodes essential: (This one is particularly important if you wan to understand what the  path means for Emacs.)A lot of the information here is found directly inside these Info pages.Additionally, I also think reading about Emacs' facilities for touchscreens and virtual keyboards (bet you didn’t know this was in the manual either!) is essential: .Moments like these are truly a testament to Emacs' dedication to an accessible editor.How to configure your  on a mobile device?Later I’ll explain how you make typing code on a touchscreen device easier by installing a handy virtual keyboard. But I highly recommend that until you’ve settled on a configuration you’re willing to type out that you heavily utilize the customize interface. This means accessing the Customize interfaces via the tool-bar buttons then using your touchscreen to tap the buttons available in  buffers. (Then, if you prefer, after setting many options with Customize, you can refactor the options Customize put in your  into e.g. use-package forms.)If you haven’t used Customize much before, you can check out the available Customize commands via  (), search for “customize.” The most useful commands are:First step: A Better UI for touchscreensThe very first thing I did when I opened Emacs was enable these minor modes:and set  to , placing it closer to where my fingers and the virtual keyboard are.Desktop users might have disabled these years ago in favor of keyboard-centric workflow, but they are awesome for touchscreens in my opinion.There are a few built-in Android commands and options you should be aware of. (Pro tip: one can  or press  in the Emacs Info manual, itself accessible via , or , then search for the string “android” to find all the specific mentions off “Android.”)Commands: to request access to file paths of other appsand its inverse, .Options:,,,(and more not useful to me).Also, don’t forget to let Emacs display over other apps. This is a device setting, not an Emacs one.Use a Special virtual keyboardUnless you have a physical keyboard connected to your mobile device, typing will be a pain. For that, we install a virtual keyword that gives us easier access to modifier keys, function keys, arrow keys, and symbols. As far as I know, there are currently two main options:Having briefly tried both, I personally prefer the latter. Though the former works just fine if you like it.You might want a set of fonts not already installed on your Android system. If that’s the case, you should read the  manual page.That page explains that if you want to install fonts for your user (in the Emacs app container), you should place them in . Getting those fonts was somewhat cumbersome for me: I had to manually download them, unzip them with Termux, place them inside a directory Emacs had access to (see Android-specific Commands and Options), then copy them to .Note: in my experience, fonts are not recursively checked inside this directory. That is, you should place your e.g. .ttf files inside that folder, not any subdirectories.Tip: You can remap the volume buttonsVolume buttons are un-mapped by default (see ). That’s find with me, but if you feel inclined, you can rebind them to something else after setting  appropriately. Some possibilities would be for navigation between headings, tk list more.Make heavy use of the Customize interface. (At least initially—after you’re comfy in Emacs, you can refactor it into a form more familiar to a desktop .)Enable minor modes and options specific to touchscreen-driven usage.Install a virtual keyboard to get access to modifiers, function keys, and more.Right now I’ve achieved a set up I’m happy with. I migrated the portions of my configuration relevant to org, org-capture, and org-node, but in the future if I need more from Emacs-on-mobile, I’ll look to expand my config as necessary. (This includes version-controlling my .)And finally: YMMV on other Android devices. My current phone is the OnePlus 7 Pro running Android version 12.There is the built-in strokes.el, but strokes.el, as far as I can tell, does not work for touchscreens. Additionally, significant changes would be required to its code base to make it compatible for touchscreens. So, for now, we have to settle with virtual keyboards…Ideally, I’d have my special virtual keyboard be automatically selected using Emacs and deselected when not using Emacs. Right now, I have to manually switch to it. As far as I know, there is no easy way to accomplish this.The tool bar and menu bar are useful, but they’re also small. I wish they were larger and easier to tap.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Revisits JPEG XL in Chromium After Earlier Removal</title><link>https://windowsreport.com/google-revisits-jpeg-xl-in-chromium-after-earlier-removal/</link><author>eln1</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 06:05:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Three years ago, Google removed JPEG XL support from Chrome, stating there wasn’t enough interest at the time.

The 386, introduced in 1985, was Intel's most complex processor at the time, containing 285,000 transistors.
Intel's existing design techniques couldn't handle this complexity and the chip began to fall behind schedule.
To meet the schedule, the 386 team started using a technique called standard cell logic.
Instead of laying out each transistor manually, the layout process was performed by a computer.The idea behind standard cell logic is to create standardized circuits (standard cells) for each type of logic element, such
as an inverter, NAND gate, or latch.
You feed your circuit description into software that selects the necessary cells, 
positions these cells into columns, and then routes the wiring between the cells.
This "automatic place and route" process creates the chip layout much faster than manual layout.
However, switching to standard cells was a risky decision since if the software couldn't create a
dense enough layout, the chip couldn't be manufactured.
But in the end, the 386 finished ahead of schedule, an almost unheard-of accomplishment.The 386's standard cell circuitry contains a few circuits that I didn't expect.
In this blog post, I'll take a quick look at some of these circuits:
surprisingly large multiplexers, a transistor that doesn't fit into the standard cell layout,
and inverters that turned out not to be inverters.
(If you want more background on standard cells in the 386, see my earlier post,
"Reverse engineering standard cell logic in the Intel 386 processor".)The photo below shows the 386 die with the automatic-place-and-route regions highlighted; I'm focusing
on the red region in the lower right.
These blocks of logic have cells arranged in rows, giving them a characteristic striped appearance.
The dark stripes are the transistors that make up the logic gates, while the lighter regions between the stripes are the
"routing channels" that hold the wiring that connects the cells.
In comparison,
functional blocks
such as the datapath on the left
and the microcode ROM in the lower right
were designed manually to optimize density and performance, giving them a more solid appearance.The 386 die with the standard-cell regions highlighted.As for other features on the chip,
the black circles around the border are bond wire connections that go to the chip's external pins.
The chip has two metal layers, a small number by modern
standards, but a jump from the single metal layer of earlier processors such as the 286.
(Providing two layers of metal made automated routing practical: one layer can hold horizontal wires while the other layer
can hold vertical wires.)
The metal appears white in larger areas, but
purplish where circuitry underneath roughens its surface.
The underlying silicon and the polysilicon wiring are obscured by the metal layers.The standard cell circuitry that I'm examining (red box above) is part of the control logic that selects registers
while executing an instruction.
You might think that it is easy to select which registers take part in an instruction, but
due to the complexity of the x86 architecture, it is more difficult.
One problem is that a 32-bit register such as EAX can also be treated as the 16-bit register AX,
or two 8-bit registers AH and AL.
A second problem is that some instructions include a "direction" bit that switches the source and
destination registers.
Moreover, sometimes the register is specified by bits in the instruction, but in other cases,
the register is specified by the microcode.
Due to these factors, selecting the registers for an operation is a complicated process with many
cases, using control bits from the instruction, from the microcode, and from other sources.Three registers need to be selected for an operation—two source registers and a destination register—and there
are about 17 cases that need to be handled.
Registers are specified with 7-bit control signals that select one of the 30 registers and control
which part of the register is accessed.
With three control signals, each 7 bits wide, and about 17 cases for each, you can see that
the register control logic is large and complicated.
(I wrote more about the 386's registers here.)I'm still reverse engineering the register control logic, so I won't go into details.
Instead, I'll discuss how the register control circuit uses multiplexers, implemented with standard cells.
A multiplexer is a circuit that combines multiple
input signals into a single output by selecting one of the inputs.
A multiplexer can be implemented with logic gates, for instance, by ANDing each input with the
corresponding control line, and then ORing the results together.
However, the 386 uses a different approach—CMOS switches—that avoids a large AND/OR gate.Schematic of a CMOS switch.The schematic above shows how a CMOS switch is constructed from two MOS transistors.
When the two transistors are on, the output is connected to the input, but when the two transistors are
off, the output is isolated.
An NMOS transistor is turned on when its input is high, but a PMOS transistor is turned on when its
input is . Thus, the switch uses two control inputs, one inverted.
The motivation for using two transistors is that an NMOS transistor is better at pulling the output
low, while a PMOS transistor is better at pulling the output high, so combining them yields the best performance.
Unlike a logic gate, the CMOS switch has no amplification, so a signal is weakened as it passes through the switch.
As will be seen below, inverters can be used to amplify the signal.The image below shows how CMOS switches appear under the microscope.
This image is very hard to interpret because the two layers of metal on the 386 are packed together densely, but you
can see that some wires run horizontally and others run vertically.
The bottom layer of metal (called M1) runs vertically in the routing area, as well as providing internal
wiring for a cell.
The top layer of metal (M2) runs horizontally; unlike M1, the M2 wires can cross a cell.
The large circles are vias that connect the M1 and M2 layers, while the small circles are connections
between M1 and polysilicon or M1 and silicon.
The central third of the image is a column of standard cells with two CMOS switches outlined in green.
The cells are bordered by the vertical ground rail and
+5V rail that power the cells. 
The routing areas are on either side of the cells, holding the wiring that connects the cells.Two CMOS switches, highlighted in green. The lower switch is flipped vertically compared to the upper switch.Removing the metal layers reveals the underlying silicon with a layer of polysilicon wiring on top.
The doped silicon regions show up as dark outlines.
I've drawn the polysilicon in green; it forms a transistor (brighter green) when it crosses doped silicon.
The metal ground and power lines are shown in blue and red, respectively, with other metal wiring in purple.
The black dots are vias between layers.
Note how metal wiring (purple) and polysilicon wiring (green) are combined to route signals within
the cell.
Although this standard cell is complicated, the important thing is that it only needs to be designed once.
The standard cells for different functions are all designed to have the same width, so the cells can be arranged in
columns, snapped together like Lego bricks.A diagram showing the silicon for a standard-cell switch. The polysilicon is shown in green. The bottom metal is shown in blue, red, and purple.To summarize, this switch circuit allows the input to be connected to the output or disconnected, controlled by the select signal.
This switch is more complicated than the earlier schematic because it includes two inverters to amplify
the signal.
The data input and the two select lines are connected to the polysilicon (green); the cell is designed so
these connections can be made on either side.
At the top, the input goes through a standard two-transistor inverter.
The lower left has two transistors, combining the NMOS half of an inverter with the NMOS half of the switch.
A similar circuit on the right combines the PMOS part of an inverter and switch.
However, because PMOS transistors are weaker, this part of the circuit is duplicated.A multiplexer is constructed by combining multiple switches, one for each input.
Turning on one switch will select the corresponding input.
For instance, a four-to-one multiplexer has four switches, so it can select one of the four inputs.A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors.The schematic above shows a hypothetical multiplexer with four inputs.
One optimization is that if an input is always 0, the PMOS transistor can be omitted. Likewise,
if an input is always 1, the NMOS transistor can be omitted.
One set of select lines is activated at a time to select the corresponding input.
The pink circuit selects 1,
green selects input A, yellow selects input B, and blue selects 0.
The multiplexers in the 386 are similar, but have more inputs.The diagram below shows how much circuitry is devoted to multiplexers in this block of standard cells.
The green, purple, and red cells correspond to the multiplexers driving the three register control
outputs.
The yellow cells are inverters that generate the inverted control signals for the CMOS switches.
This diagram also shows how the automatic layout of cells results in a layout that appears random.A block of standard-cell logic with multiplexers highlighted. The metal and polysilicon layers were removed for this photo, revealing the silicon transistors.The idea of standard-cell logic is that standardized cells are arranged in columns.
The space between the cells is the "routing channel", holding the wiring that links the cells.
The 386 circuitry follows this layout, except for one single transistor, sitting between two columns
of cells.The "misplaced" transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed.I wrote some software tools to help me analyze the standard cells. Unfortunately, my tools
assumed that all the cells were in columns, so this one wayward transistor caused me considerable inconvenience.The transistor turns out to be a PMOS transistor, pulling a signal high as part of a multiplexer.
But why is this transistor out of place?
My hypothesis is that the transistor is a bug fix.
Regenerating the cell layout was very costly, taking many hours on an IBM mainframe computer.
Presumably, someone found that they could just stick the necessary transistor into an unused spot in the
routing channel, manually add the necessary wiring, and avoid the delay of regenerating all the cells.The simplest CMOS gate is the inverter, with an NMOS transistor to pull the output low and a
PMOS transistor to pull the output high.
The standard cell circuitry that I examined contains over a hundred inverters of various
sizes.
(Performance is improved by using inverters that aren't too small but also aren't
larger than necessary for a particular circuit. Thus, the standard cell library includes inverters of multiple sizes.)The image below shows a medium-sized standard-cell inverter under the microscope.
For this image, I removed the two metal layers with acid to show the underlying polysilicon
(bright green) and silicon (gray).
The quality of this image is
poor—it is difficult to remove the metal without destroying the polysilicon—but the diagram below
should clarify the circuit.
The inverter has two transistors: a PMOS transistor connected to +5 volts to pull the output high when
the input is 0, and an NMOS transistor connected to ground to pull the output low when the input is 1.
(The PMOS transistor needs to be larger because PMOS transistors don't function as well as NMOS transistors due to
silicon physics.)An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below.The polysilicon input line plays a key role: where it crosses the doped silicon, a transistor gate is
formed.
To make the standard cell more flexible, the input to the inverter
can be connected on either the left or the right; in this case, the input
is connected on the right and there is no connection on the left.
The inverter's output can be taken from the polysilicon on the upper left or the right, but in this case, it
is taken from the upper metal layer (not shown).
The power, ground, and output lines are in the lower metal layer, which I have represented by
the thin red, blue, and yellow lines. The black circles are connections between the metal layer and
the underlying silicon.This inverter appears dozens of times in the circuitry.
However, I came across a few inverters that didn't make sense. The problem was
that the inverter's output was connected to the output of a multiplexer.
Since an inverter is either on or off, its value would clobber the output of the multiplexer.
This didn't make any sense.
I double- and triple-checked the wiring to make sure I hadn't messed up.
After more investigation, I found another problem: the input to a "bad" inverter didn't make sense
either. The input consisted of two signals shorted together, which doesn't work.Finally, I realized what was going on. A "bad inverter" has the exact silicon layout of an inverter,
but it wasn't an inverter: it was independent NMOS and PMOS transistors with separate inputs.
Now it all made sense.
With two inputs, the input signals were independent, not shorted together.
And since the transistors were controlled separately, the NMOS transistor could pull the output
low in some circumstances, the PMOS transistor could pull the output high in other circumstances,
or both transistors could be off, allowing the multiplexer's output to be used undisturbed.
In other words, the "inverter" was just two more cases for the multiplexer.The "bad" inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)If you compare the "bad inverter" cell below with the previous cell, they look  the same, but
there are subtle differences.
First, the gates of the two transistors are connected in the real inverter, but disconnected
by a small gap in the transistor pair.
I've indicated this gap in the photo above; it is hard to tell if the gap is real or just an imaging
artifact, so I didn't spot it.
The second difference is that the "fake" inverter has two input connections, one to each transistor,
while the inverter has a single input connection.
Unfortunately, I assumed that the two connections were just a trick to route the signal across
the inverter without requiring an extra wire.
In total, this cell was used 32 times as a real inverter and 9 times
as independent transistors.Standard cell logic and automatic place and route have a long history before the 386,
back to the early 1970s, so this isn't an Intel invention.
Nonetheless, the 386 team deserves the credit for deciding to use this technology at a time when it
was a risky decision.
They needed to develop custom software for their placing and routing needs, so this wasn't a trivial undertaking.
This choice paid off and they completed the 386 ahead of schedule.
The 386 ended up being a huge success for Intel, moving the x86 architecture to 32 bits and defining the dominant computer
architecture for the rest of the 20th century.If you're interested in standard cell logic, I also wrote about standard cell logic in an IBM chip.
I plan to write more about the 386, so

While this works well for many use cases, it creates friction when tools need to present visual information or gather complex user input.For example, consider a data visualization MCP server that returns chart data as JSON. The host application must interpret that data and render it. Handling all kinds of specialized data in this scenario translates to a significant burden for client developers, who would need to build their own logic to render the UI. As more UI requirements come up, like the need to collect multiple related settings from users, the complexity balloons. Alternatively, without UI support, these interactions become awkward exchanges of text prompts and responses.The MCP community has been creative in working around these limitations, but different implementations using varying conventions and architectures make it harder for servers to work consistently across clients. This lack of standardization creates a real risk of ecosystem fragmentation - something we’re working to proactively prevent.The MCP-UI project, created by Ido Salomon and Liad Yosef and maintained by a dedicated community, spearheaded the vision of agentic apps with interactive interfaces. The project developed patterns for delivering rich user interfaces as first-class MCP resources, proving that agentic apps fit naturally within the MCP architecture. The project is backed by a large community and provides rich SDKs, adopted at leading companies and projects such as Postman, Shopify, Hugging Face, Goose, and ElevenLabs.The OpenAI Apps SDK further validated the demand for rich UI experiences within conversational AI interfaces. The SDK enables developers to build rich, interactive applications inside ChatGPT using MCP as its backbone. To ensure interoperability and establish consistent security and usage patterns across the ecosystem, Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP-UI are collaborating to create an official MCP extension for interactive interfaces.MCP Apps Extension specification#We’re proposing a specification for UI resources in MCP, but the implications go further than just a set of schema changes. The MCP Apps Extension is starting to look like an agentic app runtime: a foundation for novel interactions between AI models, users, and applications. The proposal is intentionally lean, starting with core patterns that we plan on expanding over time.UI templates are resources with the  URI scheme, referenced in tool metadata.This approach enables hosts to prefetch and review templates before tool execution, improving both performance and security. It also separates static presentation (the template) from dynamic data (tool results), enabling better caching.Instead of inventing a custom message protocol, UI components communicate with hosts using existing MCP JSON-RPC base protocol over . This means that:UI developers can use the standard @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to build their applicationsAll communication is structured and auditableFuture MCP features automatically work with the UI extensionThe initial extension specification supports only  content, rendered in sandboxed iframes. This provides:Universal browser supportWell-understood security modelScreenshot and preview generation capabilitiesA clear baseline for future extensionsOther content types such as external URLs, remote DOM, and native widgets are explicitly deferred to future iterations.Hosting interactive content from MCP servers requires careful security consideration. The proposal addresses this through multiple layers:: All UI content runs in sandboxed iframes with restricted permissions: Hosts can review HTML content before rendering: All UI-to-host communication goes through loggable JSON-RPC: Hosts can require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool callsThese mitigations create defense in depth against malicious servers while preserving the flexibility developers need.MCP Apps is an optional extension. Existing implementations continue working without changes, and hosts can gradually adopt UI support at their own pace. Servers should provide text-only fallback for all UI-enabled tools and return meaningful content even when UI is unavailable, so they can serve both UI-capable and text-only hosts.The UI Community Working Group has been instrumental in shaping this proposal through extensive feedback and discussion. We have built an early access SDK to demonstrate the patterns and types described in the specification proposal.

It is very good. But rather than give you benchmark numbers, I’m going to show you how far AI has come in three years by asking the AI to demonstrate it.first post on this Substack about OpenAI’s earlier GPT-3 model.wrote I think I got that one right.I could explain the difference between the original ChatGPT and the new AI model from Google, Gemini 3, that launched today. But I don’t have to. Instead, I gave the screenshot above to Gemini 3 with a single prompt:fully interactive, playable Candy-Powered FTL Starship SimulatorIn 2022, AI could describe the engine. In 2025, AI can code the engine, design the interface, and let you pilot the ship yourself.”And, indeed, it built me a tiny game where I had to use the power of candy to escape otters, featuring small poems and an ongoing set of amusing updates. If you’re reading this blog, you probably knew AI could do that. What’s more interesting is what else Gemini 3 can do when you stop thinking of it as a chatbot and start thinking of it as something else entirelyAlong with Gemini 3, Google has launched Antigravity. For programmers, Antigravity should be familiar territory, it is similar to Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, specialized tools that can be given access to your computer and which can autonomously write computer programs with guidance. If you aren’t a programmer, you may dismiss Antigravity and similar tools. I think that is a mistake because the ability to code isn’t just about programming, it’s about being able to do anything that happens on a computer. And that changes what these tools actually are.Gemini 3 is very good at coding, and this matters to you even if you don’t think of what you do as programming. A fundamental perspective powering AI development is that everything you do on a computer is, ultimately, code, and if AI can work with code it can do anything someone with a computer can: build you dashboards, work with websites, create PowerPoint, read your files, and so on. This makes agents that can code general purpose tools. Antigravity embraces this idea, with the concept of an Inbox, a place where I can send AI agents off on assignments and where they can ping me when they need permission or help. deploy them here.It was not that Gemini 3.0 was capable of doing everything correctly without human intervention — agents aren’t there yet. There were no hallucinations I spotted, but there were things I corrected, though those errors were more about individual judgement calls or human-like misunderstandings of my intentions than traditional AI problems. Importantly, I felt that I was in control of the choices AI was making because the AI checked in and its work was visible. It felt much more like managing a teammate than prompting an AI through a chat interface.But Antigravity isn’t the only way Gemini 3 surprised me. The other was in how it handled work that required genuine judgment. As I have mentioned many times on this site, benchmarking AI progress is a mess. Gemini 3 takes a definitive benchmark lead on most stats, (although it may still not be able to beat the $200 GPT-5 Pro Model, but I suspect that might change when Gemini 3’s inevitable Deep Think version comes out). But you will hear one phrase repeated a lot in the AI world - that a model has “PhD level intelligence.”I decided to put that to the test. I gave Gemini 3 access to a directory of old files I had used for research into crowdfunding a decade ago. It was a mishmash of files labelled things like “project_final_seriously_this_time_done.xls” and data in out-of-date statistical formats. I told the AI to “figure out the data and the structure and the initial cleaning from the STATA files and get it ready to do a new analysis to find new things.” And it did, recovering corrupted data and figuring out the complexities of the environment.Then I gave it a typical assignment that you would expect from a second year PhD student, doing minor original research. With no further hints I wrote: “great, now i want you to write an original paper using this data. do deep research on the field, make the paper not just about crowdfunding but about an important theoretical topic of interest in either entrepreneurship or business strategy. conduct a sophisticated analysis, write it up as if for a journal.” I gave it no suggestions beyond that and yet the AI considered the data, generated original hypotheses, tested them statistically, and gave me formatted output in the form of a document. The most fascinating part was that I did not give it any hints about what to research, it walked the tricky tightrope of figuring out what might be an interesting topic and how to execute it with the data it had - one of the hardest things to teach. After a couple of vague commands (“build it out more, make it better”) I got a 14 page paper.Aside from this, I was impressed that the AI came up with its own measure, a way of measuring how unique a crowdfunding idea was by using natural language processing tools to compare its description mathematically to other descriptions. It wrote the code, executed it and checked the results.So is this a PhD-level intelligence? In some ways, yes, if you define a PhD level intelligence as doing the work of a competent grad student at a research university. But it also had some of the weaknesses of a grad student. The idea was good, as were many elements of the execution, but there were also problems: some of its statistical methods needed more work, some of its approaches were not optimal, some of its theorizing went too far given the evidence, and so on. Again, we have moved past hallucinations and errors to more subtle, and often human-like, concerns. Interestingly, when I gave it suggestions with a lot of leeway, the way I would a student: (“make sure that you cover the crowdfunding research more to establish methodology, etc.”) it improved tremendously, so maybe more guidance would be all that Gemini needed. We are not there yet, but “PhD intelligence” no longer seems that far away.Gemini 3 is a very good thinking and doing partner that is available to billions of people around the world. It is also a sign of many things: the fact that we have not yet seen a significant slowdown in AI’s continued development, the rise of agentic models, the need to figure out better ways to manage smart AIs, and more. It shows how far AI has come.Three years ago, we were impressed that a machine could write a poem about otters. Less than 1,000 days later, I am debating statistical methodology with an agent that built its own research environment. The era of the chatbot is turning into the era of the digital coworker. To be very clear, Gemini 3 isn’t perfect, and it still needs a manager who can guide and check it. But it suggests that “human in the loop” is evolving from “human who fixes AI mistakes” to “human who directs AI work.” And that may be the biggest change since the release of ChatGPT.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta buried &apos;causal&apos; evidence of social media harm, US court filings allege</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-buried-causal-evidence-social-media-harm-us-court-filings-allege-2025-11-23/</link><author>pseudolus</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 01:09:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does OpenAI expect a Government Bailout?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHiZ-7jI0Ew</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cHiZ-7jI0Ew?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:53:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔒 Get 20% off DeleteMe by going to https://joindeleteme.com/BOYLE and use code BOYLE to protect your privacy! 🙌🏻

My neighbor has the same outages. Xfinity won’t fix it.I bought Xfinity internet in June 2024. Immediately, my connection started dropping. Multiple times a day. Every single day. After troubleshooting every piece of equipment I had and questioning my sanity my neighbor complained about the same thing which led me to understand this was not my equipment.I set up an uptime monitor and found that these outages happen 6-7 times per day for 125 seconds.Over 17 months of my service term that’s approximately 3,387 outage incidents totaling 117+ hours of cumulative downtime.This outage pattern has recurred thousands of times. It is consistent, predictable, and it follows an automated schedule.My neighbor has the same problem. Different house. Different line from a different junction box. Same 125-second outages happening at the same times of day.Same CMTS-MAC (00:90:f0:32:11:00)Both logs show :33 and :59 minute markers (overlapping)Different modem manufacturers (proves it’s not equipment-specific)Different log formats show the EXACT SAME PATTERNBoth modems are responding to the same R-PHY node crash/restart, just at different layers of the network stack. The ~30-minute lag is expected because upstream errors take time to cascade through the downstream systems.I called support. Multiple times. They blamed my WiFi (I’m hardwired). They blamed my modem (an Xfinity Approved MB8611). They blamed my router (I tested with multiple devices). They sent a subcontracted technician. Then another subcontracted technician. Then a subcontracted crew. The crew ran a new coax line and grounded it to a water pipe that turns into PVC when it enters the ground (this doesn’t ground anything). Then they sent an Xfinity technician to look at the line.The problem never changed. The only thing that changed is my download speed dropped from advertised 1200Mbps to <500Mbps.I escalated to retention. They offered me nothing. I provided detailed technical documentation showing the exact pattern of the outages, the minute markers they occur at, the exact duration every single time. They didn’t understand it. They couldn’t escalate it.I was transferred to technical support. The person did not care and put me on speaker phone with so much background noise I couldn’t hear myself think. I imagine he was rolling his eyes while trying his utmost to care less.My Neighbor’s Attempts to Fix ItHe called Xfinity about his TV cutting out repeatedly. The technician told him his UPS grounding his coax cable was causing the problem. So he ungrounded the cable, pocketed the spare cable, and my neighbor kept having the same issues.Just in the last 72 hours I have documented 20 consecutive outages using OPNSense’s built in gateway uptime monitor. Here’s what they show:Every single outage lasted 124.8 ± 1.3 seconds. That’s not random hardware failure. That’s a timeout value hardcoded into something in Xfinity’s infrastructure.The outages cluster at specific minute markers. 35% start at minute :44. 35% start at minute :29. This is scheduled automation. This is likely a cron job or automated task running at those exact times every hour.The outages peak at specific hours. Most happen between noon and 1 PM. Others cluster in early morning around 2-3 AM. This is not random.This is an infrastructure problem on Xfinity’s network. Not on my end. Not on my neighbor’s end. Upstream. Somewhere on their equipment something is failing for exactly 125 seconds multiple times per day.I have the data. I have the patterns. I have another customer (my neighbor) on a different line experiencing the exact same thing.Xfinity has all this information. They know about the problem. They just won’t investigate it.Support can’t understand technical data. They follow scripts. When I attempted to explain monitoring logs they had no framework for discussing it. They blamed my equipment because that’s what they’re trained to do.Nobody has authority to escalate. Retention transferred me to tech support. Tech support couldn’t care nor help. They dug up my yard and placed a new line which did nothing to solve the problem. Nobody would actually order an investigation into the upstream infrastructure.There’s no pressure to fix it. Xfinity is the only gigabit provider in this area. No competition. No alternatives. I can’t leave. So they don’t have to care.A 2-minute outage every few hours is “tolerable.” It’s annoying enough to frustrate customers but not enough to make them quit (since they have nowhere else to go). It’s cheap to ignore compared to actually investigating and fixing it.There’s Also a Security ProblemAbout half of the Xfinity junction boxes in my neighborhood are unlocked or broken. Anyone can walk up and disconnect whomever they want.If your home security system is on Xfinity with no wireless backup, someone can just walk to the street and physically disconnect your internet, rob your house, and your security system won’t notify you.I’ve done everything I can do as a customer:Documented the problem professionallyEscalated through all available channelsProvided technical evidenceBeen ignored at every levelThe problem is real. My neighbor confirms it. Everyone downstream of whatever is broken on their infrastructure probably has it too.I can’t fix this. Only Xfinity can. And they won’t.So I’m publishing this hoping someone with actual authority, perhaps someone at a regulatory agency, someone at a news outlet, someone who has power over Xfinity sees this and decides to actually investigate.Because I’m out of options. My neighbors are out of options. And Xfinity’s counting on us staying out of options. Because this is the reality of my neighborhood (source):If you’re in Sacramento County and have Xfinity internet, check two things:1. Walk to your junction box. Is it locked? If not, you have a physical security problem.2. Look at where your cable grounds. Does it go to your electrical panel? Or to a water pipe? If it’s a water pipe or PVC, that’s wrong.3. Have you noticed your connection drop briefly multiple times a day? Same times of day? If you see a pattern, document it. You might have the same problem.If you want to report this:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NTSB report: Decryption of images from the Titan submersible camera [pdf] (2024)</title><link>https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Document/docBLOB?ID=18741602&amp;FileExtension=pdf&amp;FileName=Underwater%20Camera%20-%20Specialist%27s%20Factual%20Report-Rel.pdf</link><author>bmurray7jhu</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:35:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RISC-V Testing Lapse Resulted In Wrong MIPS RISC-V Vendor ID Landing In Linux 6.18</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/MIPS-RISC-V-Vendor-ID-Linux-618</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 22:24:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An interesting anecdote from this week's batch of RISC-V fixes for the Linux 6.18 kernel exposed that the MIPS RISC-V/JEDEC vendor ID was wrong for code merged at the start of the kernel cycle.

Those who were given smartphones at an earlier age were associated with worse mental health outcomes for every year of smartphone ownership before the age of 13.Early smartphone ownership was associated with feelings of lower self-image and lower self-worth in both girls and boys. Girls reported lower emotional resilience and lower confidence, while boys reported feeling less calm, less stable and less empathetic."The younger the child gets a smartphone, the more exposure to all this impacts them psychologically and shapes the way they think and view the world," Tara Thiagarajan, one of the study's authors, told ABC News in an emailed statement.About 48% of young women who had smartphones by 5 or 6 years old reported having severe suicidal thoughts, compared to 28% of females who had smartphones by 13 or older.In young men, 31% of those who had smartphones by 5 or 6 years old reported having severe suicidal thoughts and 20% of males who had smartphones by 13 or older reported having severe suicidal thoughts.Study authors attributed the differences between young women's and young men's mental health symptoms to social media usage. Other factors that seemed to impact mental health outcomes were cyberbullying, poor sleep and poor family relationships.The study's authors recommended restricting smartphone and social media access for kids under 13, promoting digital literacy education and corporate accountability."Ideally, children should not have a smartphone until age 14, and when they do get a smartphone, parents should take the time to discuss with their children how to interact on the Internet and explain the consequences of doing various things," Thiagarajan added."The longer we can push off allowing our kids to be on social media, we are learning, the better," Narula said. "I think lots of families are getting creative … landlines …. flip phones for kids [are] maybe an option so that they can have access to communicating without all the other things that come with smartphones."The study's findings come amid an effort led by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, author of "Anxious Generation," to limit kids' smartphone use due to the impact on their mental health. Haidt has proposed setting nationwide "norms" or guidelines, including not giving children a smartphone before high school, no social media before age 16 and establishing schools as phone-free zones.Pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert also recommended that parents demonstrate to children how to use smartphones responsibly."Children watch everything you do -- and that doesn't stop until they leave your house," Burgert told ABC News via email. "Connect authentically and meaningfully for a few minutes every day, and show your children that the humans we live with are more important and worthy of our attention than our phones."The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends families follow the 5 C's of media use, including teaching kids and teens how to be safe online, since content and advertisements may be targeting an older audience. - Consider your child and their personality. What media are they drawn to and how do they react to it? - Consider the content of the media your child consumes. Encourage them to consider good media sources. - Help your child learn how to manage their emotions, including without the help of media. - Consider what your family would like to spend more quality time doing, besides consuming media. - Discuss media with children early and often and encourage learning digital literacy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built a wizard to turn ideas into AI coding agent-ready specs</title><link>https://vibescaffold.dev/</link><author>straydusk</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 21:02:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(input) { architecture =  SystemDesign(input); architecture.compile();}]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Build the habit of writing meaningful commit messages</title><link>https://github.com/arpxspace/smartcommit</link><author>Aplikethewatch</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:54:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Too often I find myself being lazy with commit messages.

Before the first instruction of  is fetched, a complex, cryptographic ballet has already concluded within the Application Processor (AP). This section dissects the immutable hardware logic that establishes the initial link in the Chain of Trust.1.1 The Reset Vector & Boot ROM (SecureROM)The Apple Silicon boot process begins in a state of absolute trust, anchored by the Boot ROM (often colloquially referred to as SecureROM). This code is mask-programmed into the silicon during fabrication. It is immutable, unpatchable, and serves as the hardware root of trust for the entire platform.1.1.1 Execution at Reset: Analyzing the Reset Vector ()Upon Power-On Reset (POR), the cores of the M-series SoC (and A-series) initialize in the highest privilege state implemented by the microarchitecture. In the Armv8/v9 architecture, this role is architecturally associated with  and its reset vector register family . On Apple Silicon, public reverse engineering strongly suggests that Apple does  expose a persistent, software-visible EL3 monitor in the style of classical TrustZone. Instead, the Application Processor (AP) Boot ROM executes in an implementation-defined reset context that has strictly higher privilege than the runtime EL2/EL1 kernel environment and is the only code allowed to touch certain secure configuration registers.For the purposes of this discussion, the important property is not the exact architectural EL label, but that the Boot ROM runs in a one-shot, highest-privilege reset context that:owns the reset vector () and initial exception state, andcan program security-critical registers that are later hidden from or read-only to EL2/EL1.The execution flow begins at the address defined in the Reset Vector Base Address Register (one of the  registers, depending on the concrete implementation). Reverse engineering of recent Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) indicates the memory map places the Boot ROM at a high base address, typically observed around .The Initial Instruction Stream:The very first instructions executed by the silicon are responsible for establishing a sane C execution environment from a raw hardware state. Analysis of the entry point in similar Apple SoCs reveals a standard initialization sequence: The  bits are set to mask all interrupts (IRQ, FIQ, SError, Debug). The Boot ROM operates in a strictly polled mode; interrupts are nondeterministic and introduce attack surface. The instruction and data caches are invalidated to prevent cold-boot attacks or stale data usage. The Stack Pointer for the reset context (architecturally , but on Apple Silicon effectively the highest-privilege stack pointer) is initialized to point to a dedicated region of on-chip SRAM. DRAM is  initialized at this stage. The Boot ROM runs entirely within the constraints of the SoC’s internal SRAM. The System Control Register for the reset context ( at the highest implemented level) is programmed to enable the MMU, mapping the Boot ROM text as Read-Only/Executable and the SRAM stack/heap as Read-Write/No-Execute. Apple’s high-privilege reset context is ephemeral. There is no persistent EL3 monitor analogous to Qualcomm’s QSEE. Once the Boot ROM has initialized hardware, validated and decrypted the next stage, and “demoted” the core into the runtime EL2/EL1 regime, the reset context is no longer reachable. Subsequent firmware (LLB, iBoot, XNU) can observe the effects of its configuration but cannot re-enter that privilege level or read back the Boot ROM contents directly.1.1.2 The GID Key (Group ID): Hardware-entangled DecryptionThe Boot ROM’s primary objective is to load the Low-Level Bootloader (LLB). However, the LLB stored on the boot medium is not a raw binary; it is wrapped in an Image4 () container, and its payload () is both encrypted and, on production devices, .At the heart of this process is the .The GID Key is a 256-bit AES key fused into the silicon during manufacturing. It is shared across processors of the same class (e.g., all M3 Pro chips share a GID, distinct from M3 Max), and it never leaves the confines of the on-die crypto hardware.KBAG Unwrapping: GID as a Wrapping KeyImage4 payloads do not store the LLB ciphertext encrypted “directly under GID.” Instead, they contain an embedded : a small structure that holds per-image AES keys and IVs encrypted under the GID (and, where applicable, UID) keys.Manifest & Payload Parsing:
The Boot ROM parses the Image4 container, separates the  (Manifest) from the  (Payload), and locates the KBAG for the LLB within .KBAG Decryption (GID Slot):
The KBAG consists of one or more wrapped key records (e.g., development vs. production keys). To unwrap the appropriate record, the Boot ROM:Writes the KBAG ciphertext (the wrapped IV+key material) into the AES engine’s input FIFO.Programs the AES configuration register to use the  as the decryption source (a “use GID” control bit or mode selector).Triggers the engine. The hardware AES block internally reads the GID key from fuses, decrypts the KBAG fragment, and emits the plaintext IV and AES key for the LLB.The GID value itself is never exposed to software; only the result of the KBAG unwrap is visible.LLB Payload Decryption (Target Key):
With the per-image AES key and IV recovered from the KBAG, the Boot ROM then decrypts the LLB payload:It configures the AES engine (or, on some generations, uses the ARMv8 AES instructions) with the  obtained from the KBAG.It streams the LLB ciphertext through this AES context into SRAM, yielding the plaintext LLB image.
After decryption, the AES hardware clears any internal registers holding the GID-derived material. The Boot ROM code has no mechanism to read back the GID key and no direct path to expose the target key outside the immediate decryption context.This two-stage scheme (GID → KBAG → LLB) is what makes the system : the cryptographic key that ultimately decrypts the bootloader exists only as the output of a GID-protected unwrap on  class of silicon.Even if an attacker gains arbitrary code execution inside the Boot ROM (as in -class vulnerabilities on earlier A-series devices), they still cannot extract the raw GID key and cannot perform offline decryption of production firmware:The GID key is never mapped into general-purpose registers or memory.The only decryption primitive available is “unwrap KBAG under GID,” running  the AES peripheral.Firmware images must be decrypted , with the AES engine acting as a constrained decryption oracle at best, and only for keys/payloads consistent with the KBAG format accepted by the ROM.1.1.3 The Public Key Accelerator (PKA): Hardware-Enforced VerificationDecryption provides confidentiality, but not integrity. To prevent the execution of malicious firmware, the Boot ROM enforces strict code signing using the Public Key Accelerator (PKA).The PKA is a dedicated hardware block optimized for asymmetric cryptography (RSA and ECC). The verification flow is as follows: The Apple Root CA public key is embedded directly within the immutable Boot ROM code. This serves as the anchor for the chain of trust. The Boot ROM parses the Image4 (img4) container of the LLB. It extracts the Image4 Manifest (IM4M), which contains the payload's signature and the certificate chain used to sign it. The Boot ROM validates the certificate chain found in the manifest against the Root CA embedded in the ROM. If the chain is invalid or does not lead back to the hardware anchor, the boot halts (the device typically enters DFU/Recovery mode). The Boot ROM offloads the signature verification to the PKA. It passes the hash of the payload (typically SHA-2 family) and the RSA/ECC signature. The PKA performs the mathematical verification. Architectural inference and reverse engineering suggest it returns a boolean result to a status register, although this specific implementation detail is not explicitly defined in public Apple documentation.Fault Injection Hardening:
Analysis of recent Apple Boot ROMs suggests the implementation of glitch-resistant logic around the PKA check. Rather than a simple  (Branch if Equal) instruction following the PKA result—which could be bypassed via voltage glitching—reverse engineering indicates the code often employs redundant checks, loop invariants, or specific register values that must be populated by the PKA hardware itself to allow the boot flow to proceed.1.1.4 RE Focus: Dev vs. Prod Fused SiliconFor reverse engineering and exploit development, distinguishing  from  silicon is critical. The Boot ROM and security subsystem change behavior based on fuse fields that encode the  of the chip.A central knob here is Apple’s  field (“Chip Production / Firmware Mode”), burned into fuses and exposed in various debug logs and DFU responses.Across multiple generations, public Boot ROM banners and tooling logs show a consistent pattern:
Used for  or internal security domains:Enable richer debug visibility.Allow additional boot modes and demotion paths.Often relax some signature enforcement or allow alternate signing roots for internal firmware.
Standard  configuration for consumer devices:Full signature enforcement for all boot stages.Debug interfaces (JTAG/SWD) and invasive trace disabled or tightly restricted.The exact semantics of intermediary values (e.g., ) and the precise bit-level encoding are SoC- and generation-specific, but the broad distinction above is stable across published ROM dumps and DFU tooling.This is the configuration for retail hardware: Disabled or heavily locked. External debug probes cannot halt the core at reset in any supported way. The GID key is set to the production group value, shared only across chips of the same class, and never accessible via software. The Boot ROM enforces the full Apple Root CA chain and Image4 constraints. Unsupported or revoked OS builds fail before DRAM initialization, dropping the device into DFU.Development (CPFM ≈ 0x0 / 0x1):Dev-fused devices, including security research units and internal engineering hardware, typically relax some of these constraints: The  /  debug signals are asserted. Hardware debuggers (Lauterbach, Astris, etc.) can halt the core immediately after reset and single-step Boot ROM code. Dev-fused chips can usually enter “demoted” modes where unsigned or custom-signed firmware images are bootable. The exact mechanisms (special DFU commands, provisioning profiles, or special Image4 manifests) are implementation details, but the high-level effect is that certain signature and version checks are bypassed or altered for internal workflows. Dev silicon often uses a distinct GID key (or set of keys) from production. This means:Firmware encrypted for Prod cannot be decrypted on Dev, and vice versa.Dev images are cryptographically bound to dev-fused hardware, preventing accidental cross-leakage into production units.Identifying Silicon State in Practice:From the outside, the security domain can be inferred via DFU and other low-level interfaces:
USB DFU responses (e.g., from , , or equivalent tooling) expose fields such as , , and CPFM-like indicators. On many platforms:Values where CPFM-like bits are  correspond to production devices.Values where CPFM-like bits are  or  correspond to dev-fused hardware.
Reverse-engineering tools often apply heuristic masks to these fields to classify devices. For example, certain high bits set in  or specific ranges in  are empirically associated with production vs. development, but the exact encodings vary by SoC and should be treated as version-specific heuristics rather than universal rules.The “Un-dumpable” Region:Regardless of dev or prod state, once the Boot ROM prepares to jump to the next stage (LLB), it typically performs a lockdown sequence:Writes to the memory controller or system registers to unmap its own address range (e.g., around ) from the normal physical address space.Ensures that any subsequent attempt by LLB or the kernel to read that region either raises a bus error or returns zeros.This is why practical Boot ROM dumps require a vulnerability  the Boot ROM execution window (e.g., -style exploits or carefully timed glitching) rather than a simple read from a later boot stage. On production (CPFM ≈ 0x3) devices this window is tightly constrained; on dev-fused hardware, JTAG/SWD access and relaxed policy make that window significantly easier to instrument but do not fundamentally change the “self-erasing” behavior.1.2 Proprietary ISA Extensions (arm64e+)While the M-series cores implement the Armv8-A architecture with a comprehensive set of optional extensions (e.g., , ), Apple has aggressively extended the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with proprietary logic. For the reverse engineer, standard Arm documentation is insufficient. Understanding the security posture of macOS Tahoe requires mastering these custom extensions, as they form the hardware enforcement layer for the new kernel isolation model.1.2.1 Pointer Authentication (PAC): The Cryptographic Control FlowApple’s implementation of Armv8.3-PAuth is the most pervasive security mitigation in the XNU kernel. It repurposes the unused high-order bits above the configured virtual address size (the "top" bits of a 64-bit pointer) to store a cryptographic signature, or Pointer Authentication Code (PAC).
The hardware maintains five distinct 128-bit keys in system registers. On macOS with VHE (Virtualization Host Extensions) enabled, the kernel accesses these keys via the  register aliases, which the hardware redirects to the EL2 bank of the key registers: /  (Instruction): Signs code pointers (function pointers, return addresses). Signs data pointers. Crucial for protecting C++ vtables in IOKit (). Signs arbitrary data blobs, effectively a hardware-accelerated MAC.The  Failure Mechanism (Canonical Non-Valid):
For the reverse engineer analyzing crash dumps, understanding the failure mode is critical. When an  instruction (e.g., ) is executed on a corrupted or forged pointer, the CPU does  immediately raise an exception.Instead, the hardware corrupts the pointer in a deterministic way to ensure it causes a translation fault upon dereference. The CPU recalculates the PAC. If the calculated PAC does not match the bits in the pointer, the CPU writes an error pattern into the PAC field, flipping specific high-order bits. The pointer becomes a "canonical non-address": the PAC field is overwritten with an error pattern so that any use of the pointer leads to an architectural fault. The subsequent  or  triggers a Data Abort or Prefetch Abort. Empirically, on many M-series SoCs, a PAC authentication failure often manifests as a pointer where the upper byte is partially set (e.g.,  or ). If you see a crash involving such a pointer, you are likely looking at a PAC failure rather than a standard NULL dereference or heap corruption.1.2.2 Branch Target Identification (BTI): The Landing PadsOften deployed in tandem with PAC (-mbranch-protection=standard), BTI mitigates Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP). It enforces a state machine on indirect branches. The Page Table Entries (PTE) now include a Guarded Page () bit. This is a "hint" instruction (NOP on older silicon). It acts as a valid landing pad. When the CPU executes an indirect branch (, ) targeting a Guarded Page, the very next instruction  be a  instruction of the correct type ( for call,  for jump,  for both).If the target is not a  instruction, the CPU raises a . In XNU, observations suggest this often manifests as a  (Illegal Instruction) with a specific subcode, distinguishing it from standard undefined opcode exceptions. For exploit development, this necessitates finding gadgets that not only perform the desired operation but are also preceded by a valid landing pad.1.2.3  The Guarded Execution Feature (GXF)This is the most significant architectural divergence in the Apple Silicon era. Standard Arm defines a vertical privilege stack (EL0 → EL1 → EL2). Apple has introduced a parallel execution domain, conceptually a  (distinct from Arm TrustZone), accessed via .GXF allows the processor to switch between the "Normal World" (where macOS runs) and the "Secure World" (where Exclaves run). These worlds share the same physical silicon but possess vastly different hardware permissions and system register views.
Guarded Levels (GL) do not merely mirror standard Exception Levels in a parallel context; GL2 maps directly to the hardware Exception Level 2 (EL2), effectively repurposing the architectural level for the monitor. The mapping for macOS Tahoe is as follows: Userland processes (Apps, Daemons). The XNU Kernel. On M4 systems employing the Tahoe architecture, the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) occupies the hardware EL2 (mapped to GL2). Consequently, the XNU kernel operates at GL1 (Hardware EL1) as a virtualized guest, rather than executing at EL2. (secure user workloads) and a privileged Conclave hosting the Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM). This is where policy logic, privacy indicators, and Passkey logic reside.The Secure Kernel (ExclaveOS). An L4-inspired microkernel responsible for scheduling and IPC within the secure world.The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM). The ultimate hardware root of trust, mirroring the privilege of a hypervisor but strictly for security enforcement.
Transitions between worlds are not handled by standard  calls. Apple added custom instructions to the ISA: (Opcode ): Synchronous entry into the Secure World. It behaves like a hypercall, atomically switching the hardware context (SPRR state, stack pointer, and system registers) from ELx to GLx. Returns from the Secure World to the Normal World.1.2.4  Shadow Permission Remapping Registers (SPRR)To enforce isolation between the Normal World (XNU) and the Secure World (Exclaves), Apple replaced the older APRR (Access Permission Remapping Registers) on newer silicon (A15/M2+) with the more robust SPRR (Shadow Permission Remapping Registers).In standard Arm MMUs, the Page Table Entry (PTE) bits define permissions directly. In Apple Silicon with SPRR enabled, the PTE's  bits and NX bits (, ) are repurposed as a  into a hardware permission table. The PTE specifies a permission index (e.g., Index 5). The hardware checks the current execution mode (EL2, GL1, or GL2). It looks up Index 5 in the  register specific to that mode.The Security Implication:
This allows for "View-Based" memory protection.A particular SPRR index (for example, index 5) is configured so that in  it resolves to .The same index resolves to  in .This is how the SPTM protects page tables. The physical pages containing the translation tables are marked with a specific SPRR index. The hardware configuration for EL2 (Kernel) maps that index to Read-Only. Even if an attacker has a kernel-level arbitrary write primitive, the MMU will reject the write to the page table because the SPRR configuration for EL2 forbids it. The only way to write to that page is to execute  to switch to GL2, where the SPRR configuration permits the write.If the Application Processor (AP) is the brain of the device, the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) is its conscience. It is not merely a coprocessor; it is a fully independent computer-on-a-chip, sharing the same die but architecturally severed from the AP. It runs its own operating system (), based on an Apple-customized L4 microkernel, manages its own peripherals, and holds the keys to the kingdom (UID/GID). In the macOS Tahoe generation, the SEP effectively acts as the root of authority for biometric authentication decisions and for OS-bound key material used in attestation and Data Protection.2.1 SEP Initialization & BootThe SEP boot process is designed to be resilient against a fully compromised Application Processor. From the moment power is applied, the SEP operates under the threat model that the AP is hostile.2.1.1 The SEPROM: SRAM Execution and the Memory Protection Engine (MPE)Like the AP, the SEP begins execution from an immutable on-die Boot ROM, the .The Hardware Environment:
The SEP core (historically an ARMv7-A "Kingfisher" core on A7–A9, though the specific microarchitecture of M-series SEP cores is undocumented) initializes in a highly constrained environment. Execution begins in the SEPROM using a small on-die SRAM for stack and early state. However, the  is too large to fit entirely in SRAM. To utilize the device's main DRAM securely, the SEP relies on the Memory Protection Engine (MPE). Before the SEP accesses external DRAM, the Boot ROM initializes the MPE, ensuring all subsequent memory transactions are encrypted and authenticated. This isolation prevents early-boot DMA attacks from the AP or Thunderbolt peripherals.The Memory Protection Engine (MPE):
The MPE sits inline between the SEP core and the memory controller. It creates a cryptographic window into physical memory that is opaque to the rest of the SoC. On system startup, the SEP Boot ROM programs the MPE with a random, ephemeral AES key. This key exists only in the MPE hardware registers and is never exposed to software (even ). On M-series silicon, the MPE manages distinct ephemeral keys for the SEP and the Secure Neural Engine (SNE), ensuring isolation even between secure subsystems. Data written by the SEP to DRAM is encrypted transparently using AES in XEX (XOR-Encrypt-XOR) mode. The MPE calculates a CMAC tag for every block of memory (cache line granularity). This tag is stored alongside the encrypted data. If you attempt to dump the physical memory range assigned to the SEP from the AP (kernel mode), you will see high-entropy noise. Furthermore, any attempt to modify a single bit of this memory via the AP will invalidate the CMAC tag. The next time the SEP reads that line, the MPE will detect the forgery and trigger a hardware panic, locking down the Enclave until a full system reset.2.1.2 The Boot Monitor: Hardware Enforcement of OS-Bound KeysOn modern silicon (A13/M1 and later), Apple introduced the Secure Enclave Boot Monitor to mitigate the risk of Boot ROM exploits (like ) compromising the chain of trust for key derivation.In older architectures, the SEPROM would verify the  signature and then jump to it. If the SEPROM was exploited, the attacker could jump to a malicious payload while retaining access to the hardware UID key. The Boot Monitor closes this gap by enforcing System Coprocessor Integrity Protection (SCIP). The AP (iBoot) loads the  payload into a region of physical memory. The AP signals the SEP via a hardware mailbox register. The SEPROM parses the Image4 container. It verifies the signature against the SEP-specific Apple Root CA public key embedded within the immutable SEPROM. Crucially, the SEPROM  simply jump to the loaded image. The SCIP hardware prevents execution of mutable memory. The SEPROM invokes the Boot Monitor hardware block.
The Monitor  the SEP core to a known clean state.The Monitor calculates a cryptographic hash of the loaded  memory range.The Monitor updates the SCIP registers to permit execution of that specific range.The Boot ROM and Boot Monitor jointly produce a measurement of the loaded  and lock it into a dedicated register used by the Public Key Accelerator (PKA).
This finalized hash is the critical component. When the  later requests keys (e.g., to decrypt user data), the hardware Key Derivation Function (KDF) mixes the hardware UID with this locked hash.$$ K_{derived} = KDF(UID, Hash_{sepOS}) $$If an attacker modifies a single byte of the  (even with a Boot ROM exploit), the Boot Monitor calculates a different hash. Consequently, the KDF derives different OS-bound keys, so any data protected by those keys (e.g., passcode- and SKP-bound Data Protection keys) remains cryptographically inaccessible under the modified . This is "Bound Security"—the data is bound not just to the device, but to a specific, signed software version.2.1.3 Anti-Replay Mechanisms: The Integrity TreeA classic attack vector against secure enclaves is the : capturing a snapshot of the encrypted RAM (e.g., when the passcode retry counter is 0) and restoring it later after the counter has incremented.To prevent this, the SEP implements a hardware-enforced  (Merkle Tree). The root node of the integrity tree is stored in  within the Secure Enclave complex. This memory is physically distinct from the main DRAM and cannot be addressed by the AP. The protected memory region (where  data and the Secure Storage Manager reside) is divided into blocks. Each block's hash is stored in a parent node, recursively up to the root. When the SEP writes to protected memory (e.g., incrementing a failed attempt counter), the MPE updates the data, recalculates the hashes up the tree, and atomically updates the root hash in the on-chip SRAM. On every read, the MPE verifies the path from the data block up to the SRAM root.If an attacker replays an old DRAM state, the hash of the replayed block will not match the current root hash stored in the internal SRAM. The MPE detects the mismatch (Anti-Replay Violation) and halts the SEP. This mechanism ensures that the SEP has a strictly monotonic view of time and state, rendering snapshot fuzzing and counter rollbacks impossible.2.2 SEP Runtime ArchitectureOnce the  is bootstrapped and verified, the Secure Enclave transitions into its runtime state. At this point, it functions as a fully autonomous operating system running an Apple-customized variant of the L4 microkernel (historically derived from L4-embedded/Darbat). For the reverse engineer, understanding the runtime architecture is crucial for analyzing how the SEP communicates with the hostile "Rich Execution Environment" (the AP running XNU) and how it persists sensitive state.2.2.1 The Mailbox Interface: Analyzing the IPC TransportCommunication between the Application Processor (AP) and the SEP is strictly asynchronous and interrupt-driven. Unlike the tight coupling of the SPTM (which uses synchronous instruction traps), the SEP interaction is mediated by a hardware mechanism known as the , which relies on the proprietary Apple Interrupt Controller (AIC) to manage signaling.The Physical Transport: Registers and Shared Memory
There is no shared virtual memory space; the two processors exchange messages via a combination of Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) registers and physical memory buffers.The Control Mailbox (MMIO):
The primary control channel consists of dedicated hardware registers within the SEP's configuration space (typically mapped at  on A-series, with evolving offsets on M-series). The AP writes a message to the  register, which triggers an IRQ on the SEP. The SEP writes a reply to the  register, which triggers an IRQ on the AP. On Apple Silicon (M1+), reverse engineering of the  driver indicates a shift toward using shared memory ring buffers for the control path to handle higher throughput, managed by the AIC's hardware event lines.The Doorbell (Apple Interrupt Controller):
To signal a message, the sender must trigger an exception on the receiver. The kernel writes to a specific AIC "Set" register. This asserts a hardware IRQ line wired to the SEP's core. When the SEP replies, it asserts an IRQ line routed to the AP's AIC. The kernel's interrupt handler (within ) acknowledges this by writing to the AIC "Clear" register.
The data payload passed through the control registers follows a strict, serialized format (often referred to as the  format). Analysis of the  /  stack reveals a compact 64-bit structure:struct sep_msg {
    uint8_t endpoint;  // Destination service (e.g., 0x10)
    uint8_t tag;       // Transaction ID for async correlation
    uint8_t opcode;    // Message type / Command
    uint8_t param;     // Immediate parameter
    uint32_t data;     // Payload or pointer to OOL buffer
};
 Routes the message to a specific task within  (e.g., the Secure Key Store).Out-of-Line (OOL) Buffers: For payloads larger than 32 bits (such as biometric templates or firmware updates), the  field contains a physical address. The AP allocates a physical page, pins it, and passes the address to the SEP. The SEP maps this page into its address space using its own IOMMU (often implemented via  on M-series chips).RE Focus: Fuzzing the Boundary
The mailbox is the primary attack surface for the SEP. Vulnerabilities here (parsing malformed messages) can lead to code execution within the Enclave. The  kernel dispatches messages to user-mode L4 tasks based on the Endpoint ID. Fuzzing specific endpoints (especially legacy or debug endpoints left enabled in production) is a standard methodology.Shared Memory Hazards (TOCTOU): While the mailbox registers handle control flow, bulk data is passed via shared memory. A classic attack vector involves the AP modifying the data in the shared buffer  the SEP has validated the header/signature but  it processes the body (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use).The SEP has no general-purpose NAND flash of its own. It must rely on the Application Processor’s storage stack to persist long-lived secrets (passcode state, biometric templates, token material). However, it cannot  the AP or its filesystem to store this data without tampering.To solve this, Apple pairs the SEP with a , often referred to in firmware and kexts as  (eXtended Anti-Replay Technology).At a high level, xART behaves as a dedicated, tamper-resistant non-volatile store that is  attached exclusively to the SEP:It has its own non-volatile memory and cryptographic logic.It is only addressable from within the SEP’s trust domain over a dedicated, authenticated channel.The AP and XNU have no direct protocol to read or write its contents; all access is mediated by .You can think of xART as a small, secure NVRAM bank whose sole purpose is to hold anti-replay metadata and counters that anchor SEP-managed state.Physical / Logical Separation:At the implementation level, the Secure Storage Component may be a discrete die or a dedicated block within a larger package, but architecturally it presents as a separate secure store accessed only by the SEP.The AP sees none of its registers or address space; there are no MMIO ranges that the kernel can map to talk directly to xART.SEP-Centric View of Storage:The SEP treats AP-managed NAND (the main SSD / NVMe) as an untrusted block device.All SEP data structures stored there (keybags, counters, templates, tickets) are encrypted and authenticated using keys derived from the UID/GID and xART’s state.The xART component holds the small, high-value bits: monotonic counters, per-volume or per-domain nonces, and commitment hashes for larger encrypted blobs stored on the AP’s filesystem.The Anti-Replay Guarantee:When the SEP writes persistent state—for example, updating the failed passcode attempt counter or credential state—it performs a two-phase commit:Write to Untrusted Storage (AP):The SEP encrypts the payload (e.g., a keybag or metadata record) with keys derived from the UID and appropriate class keys.It sends the ciphertext to the AP via the mailbox protocol.The AP writes this to its filesystem (e.g., a file under ), but the contents are opaque to it.Commit to xART (Secure Storage Component):In parallel, the SEP computes a cryptographic digest (e.g., a hash or MAC) over the new payload and the associated monotonic counter or nonce.It writes this digest and the updated counter/nonce to xART.xART becomes the authoritative record of “what the latest version of this object should look like” and “how many times it has been updated.”The SEP requests the ciphertext from the AP.It recomputes the digest and compares it against the value stored in xART for that object.If the digests and counters match, the SEP accepts and decrypts the payload.If the AP has replayed an old copy (e.g., with a lower counter or different hash), the mismatch is detected and the SEP treats it as an —typically halting access to that data or, in severe cases, triggering a lockout.
The SEP’s view of sensitive state (e.g., passcode retry counters, escrow records) is strictly monotonic. An attacker cannot reset or roll back these counters by snapshotting and restoring AP-visible storage, because xART’s internal counters would not match.
From the AP’s perspective, xART is a black box. It sees only that some SEP operation failed or succeeded; it never observes the internal counters, keys, or hashes that xART maintains.
SEP-managed data is effectively bound to:The specific SEP instance (via UID).The xART anti-replay state (counters / nonces).The software measurement (for SKP-like mechanisms described later).For reverse engineering, the important consequences are:Dumping or modifying the files that back SEP state on the AP is insufficient to reset security-sensitive conditions (e.g., passcode retry counters, keybag versions). Without aligning xART’s internal state, any replay will be detected and rejected.There is no direct AP-visible interface to xART; all interesting protocol surface is in: endpoint handlers that manipulate anti-replay state.The  and related kexts and daemons that proxy higher-level requests (FileVault, Keychain, biometric state) into SEP commands.Exploits that attempt to tamper with SEP persistence must target:The integrity of SEP’s logic around xART updates, orThe boundary between SEP and AP (e.g., TOCTOU races on the untrusted ciphertext), not the xART hardware itself.2.2.3  Reverse Engineering the  L4 Syscall TableFor the advanced reverse engineer, the holy grail is understanding the  kernel itself. Since it is based on L4, it relies heavily on synchronous IPC for system calls.Identifying the Syscall Handler:
In the disassembled  binary (decrypted via Boot ROM exploit), the exception vector table is the starting point. The  handler dispatches requests based on the immediate value or a register (typically  or ).
The  is modular, consisting of the kernel and several user-mode "apps" or "tasks." Analysis of firmware dumps reveals the internal naming convention: The root task and kernel. The backend for , managing Data Protection and Keychain items. (Secure Biometric Sensor Driver): The backend for , handling the processing of fingerprint and face data. Manages communication with the NFC Secure Element for Apple Pay. A directory service mapping symbolic names to endpoints.By tracing the IPC messages dispatched from the Mailbox handler, you can map which L4 task handles which service. For example, messages routed to the endpoint associated with  will contain the proprietary command structures for biometric enrollment and matching. Analyzing the message parsing logic within that specific task reveals the attack surface for biometric bypasses. Standard tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra require custom loaders for  binaries. The memory layout is non-standard, and the binary format (Mach-O) often has stripped headers or non-standard segment protections that must be manually reconstructed based on the SCIP configuration found in the Boot Monitor logic.3.0 The Chain of Trust: Firmware & BootloadersWith the hardware root of trust established and the Secure Enclave operating as a parallel authority, the Application Processor begins the process of bootstrapping the mutable software stack. This phase is governed by the  serialization format and a strict chain of cryptographic handover.3.1 Low-Level Bootloader (LLB)On platforms that implement an LLB stage (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs and older A-series SoCs), the Low-Level Bootloader (LLB) is the first piece of mutable code executed by the Application Processor. Loaded by the Boot ROM from the boot partition of the internal flash (NAND, or NOR SPI on some development hardware), it executes initially out of on-die SRAM before DRAM has been brought online. Its primary directive is architectural: it must bridge the gap between the raw silicon state and the feature-rich environment required by iBoot.3.1.1 Parsing the Image4 () ContainerTo the reverse engineer, "firmware" on Apple Silicon is synonymous with . LLB is not a raw binary; it is encapsulated in an Image4 container, a format based on ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). Understanding this structure is prerequisite to any firmware analysis.A complete Image4 object consists of an  and an , with an optional  object used in restore flows. The actual executable code (the LLB binary). The payload is encrypted under a per-image AES key. On production devices, this per-image key is wrapped using the SoC’s  and stored in the  tag within the payload. At boot, the hardware AES engine unwraps the KBAG under the GID key to recover the IV and payload key, then decrypts the payload. This means the payload is opaque to external analysis unless decrypted on-device (or via a GID oracle). Once decrypted, the payload is typically compressed (LZSS or LZFSE). A 4-character code (e.g., , ) identifying the component. The signature and constraints, commonly known as the . An RSA or ECDSA signature over the SHA-384 hash of the payload. A set of entitlements and constraints (tags) that dictate  and  this payload can run. The manifest includes the certificate chain leading back to the Apple Root CA. The Boot ROM holds the corresponding root public key (or its hash) in immutable hardware and verifies the chain using the Public Key Accelerator (PKA). (Optional) Contains hardware-specific personalization data used during the restore process, such as the unique nonce generated by the SEP.
When the Boot ROM loads LLB (and when LLB subsequently loads iBoot), it performs the following  routine:Parse the ASN.1 structure to separate  and .Hash the  (ciphertext).Locate the corresponding hash in the  (under the specific tag, e.g., ).Verify the  signature using the PKA.If valid, the hardware unwraps the payload key from the KBAG using the GID Key, loads it into the AES engine, and decrypts the  ciphertext.3.1.2 DRAM Training and Memory Controller ConfigurationBefore external LPDDR4X/LPDDR5 Unified Memory can be used, the memory controller and PHY must be trained. Early boot code (Boot ROM and/or LLB) runs initially from on-die SRAM until DRAM training has converged. The physical characteristics of RAM—signal timing, voltage margins, and skew—vary slightly between every physical device due to manufacturing tolerances.Reading SPD/Calibration Data: The boot code reads calibration data from the device tree or dedicated EEPROM areas. It configures the Physical Layer (PHY) interface of the memory controller. The code executes a complex algorithm that writes patterns to DRAM and reads them back, adjusting delay lines (DLLs) and drive strengths until the signal is stable. Once training is complete, the MCU is brought online. The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is then reconfigured to map the vast expanse of DRAM into the address space.
If you are attempting to exploit the Boot ROM or early LLB, you are constrained to SRAM. You cannot load large payloads or use heap spraying techniques that require gigabytes of memory until  the bootloader has successfully trained the DRAM. This creates a "choke point" for early-boot exploits.3.1.3 Verifying the Exclusive Chip ID (ECID) and Board IDApple utilizes a mechanism called  (or Taming) to prevent firmware replay attacks. You cannot simply take a valid, signed LLB from one iPhone and run it on another, nor can you downgrade to an older, vulnerable LLB version.This enforcement happens inside the Image4 parser logic within LLB (checking the next stage) and the Boot ROM (checking LLB).
The  manifest contains specific tags that bind the signature to the hardware: A unique per-SoC identifier fused into the chip and exposed as an integer value used for personalization. Identifies the PCB model (e.g.,  for a specific iPhone logic board). Identifies the SoC model (e.g.,  for M1). for Production,  for Development.
During boot, the executing code reads the actual values from the hardware fuses and compares them against the values present in the signed .If Hardware.ECID != Manifest.ECID, the boot halts.If Hardware.BORD != Manifest.BORD, the boot halts.This mechanism, combined with the  (a random value generated by the SEP during updates and baked into the ), ensures that the firmware is: Signed by Apple. Valid only for . Valid only for this specific boot/update cycle (preventing downgrades). In the "Tahoe" architecture, reverse engineering suggests this verification logic appears to use redundant checks and bitwise operations that resist simple instruction skipping (e.g., glitching a  instruction).3.2 iBoot (Stage 2 Bootloader)Once LLB has initialized the DRAM and verified the next stage, it hands off execution to . While LLB is a hardware-focused shim, iBoot is a sophisticated, compact operating system in its own right. It features a cooperative task scheduler (rather than a simple single-threaded loop) that manages concurrent subsystems including a full USB stack, a display driver (for the Apple logo), and a filesystem driver (APFS/HFS+). In the Tahoe architecture, iBoot’s role has expanded beyond merely bootstrapping the XNU kernel; it now serves as the orchestrator of the platform's security domains, responsible for loading and isolating the hardware-enforced monitors before the kernel is permitted to execute.3.2.1 The Apple Device Tree (ADT)The hardware configuration of an Apple Silicon device is not discoverable via standard buses like PCI enumeration alone. Instead, iBoot relies on the —a hierarchical binary data structure (conceptually similar to OpenFirmware or Linux Device Trees) that describes the SoC's topology.
The raw ADT is either embedded within the iBoot binary or loaded as a separate  payload. It contains nodes describing CPUs, memory maps, interrupt controllers (AIC), and peripherals. Unlike Linux systems which often use a "Flattened Device Tree" (FDT), Apple utilizes its own proprietary binary format for the ADT, which XNU consumes directly via the  APIs.Runtime Population ():
Before jumping to the kernel, iBoot populates the  node of the ADT with critical runtime parameters. A high-entropy random value (inferred to be derived from the TRNG). The kernel uses this to randomize its memory slide. A critical array of structures defining physical memory regions. iBoot marks regions used by the Boot ROM, LLB, and itself as reserved, ensuring the kernel does not overwrite them. The command-line arguments passed to the kernel (e.g., , ). On production devices, these are strictly filtered based on the  flags in LocalPolicy; only specific flags are allowed unless the device is in a specific research or demoted state.3.2.2  Loading the Security MonitorsIn pre-Tahoe architectures (iOS 14 / macOS 11), iBoot would simply load the kernelcache and jump to it. In the Tahoe era (A15/M2+), iBoot must construct the Guarded Execution Environment before the kernel can exist.Allocation and Reservation:
iBoot parses the device tree to identify physical memory ranges reserved for the new monitors. It carves these out of the available DRAM: Reserved for the Secure Page Table Monitor. Reserved for the Trusted Execution Monitor.
iBoot locates the specific Image4 payloads, which are co-packaged with the kernelcache (referenced in the OS firmware manifest):Ap,SecurePageTableMonitor: The GL2 binary.Ap,TrustedExecutionMonitor: The GL1 binary.It decrypts and verifies these payloads just like any other firmware component. However, instead of loading them into standard memory, it loads them into the reserved physical regions identified above.Locking SPRR Regions (Conceptual View):
This is the critical security pivot. Before handing off control, iBoot establishes the initial Shadow Permission Remapping Registers (SPRR) state to enforce isolation. While the SPTM performs its own fine-grained configuration upon initialization, the architectural guarantee provided by iBoot is:The  view is configured to have Read/Write/Execute access to its own memory region.The  view is configured to have access to its region.Crucially, the  view is configured to mark the SPTM and TXM regions as .This ensures that when the processor eventually drops to EL1 (GL0) to run XNU, the kernel is physically incapable of reading or modifying the monitor code, even though it resides in the same physical DRAM.3.2.3 LocalPolicy & BAA: The Shift to Local SigningFor macOS, Apple introduced a mechanism to allow users to boot older OS versions or custom kernels (Permissive Security) without breaking the hardware chain of trust. This is managed via .
The Boot ROM and LLB enforce strict signature checks using manifests issued by Apple's global signing server (TSS). These checks are performed offline using embedded root keys. If you want to boot a custom kernel, you cannot obtain a valid signature from Apple's TSS. A policy file stored on the Data Volume (in the  volume). It specifies the security mode (Full, Reduced, Permissive) and the hash of the custom kernel collection.Owner Identity Key (OIK): When a user authorizes a downgrade or custom boot (via Recovery Mode authentication), they are effectively authorizing the use of a device-specific  generated within the Secure Enclave. This key is certified once by Apple's Basic Attestation Authority (BAA). The LocalPolicy is signed by the SEP using this OIK. iBoot fetches the LocalPolicy. It asks the SEP to verify the signature against the OIK. If the SEP confirms the policy is valid (and matches the user's intent), iBoot proceeds to load the custom kernel hash specified in the policy (enabled via the  bit), effectively "blessing" it for this boot cycle.This allows "Permissive Security" to exist while keeping the Boot ROM and LLB strictly locked down to the hardware root of trust.3.2.4  Decrypting iBoot Payloads via the AES MMIO InterfaceTo analyze iBoot, one must decrypt it. Since the GID key is fused into the silicon and physically disconnected from the CPU's register file, it cannot be extracted via software. Reverse engineers must instead turn the device into a  by manipulating the dedicated AES hardware peripheral.
The Image4 payload () is encrypted with a random, per-file symmetric key (the target key). This target key is wrapped (encrypted) with the GID key and stored in the  header as a . To decrypt the firmware, one must unwrap this kbag.The Hardware Distinction (ISA vs. MMIO):
It is critical to distinguish between the  (instructions like , ) and the . Operates on keys loaded into standard NEON/SIMD registers (-). Useful for TLS or disk encryption where the key is known to the OS. A memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) block, typically located at a base offset like  (on M1/T8103) or similar  ranges on newer SoCs. This peripheral has exclusive hardware access to the GID key fuses.
Using a Boot ROM exploit (like  on A-series) or a specialized iBoot exploit, researchers execute a payload that drives this MMIO interface directly: Reset the AES peripheral via the  register to clear internal state. Write to the configuration register to select the  as the decryption source. This sets an internal mux; the key itself is never exposed to the bus. Write the  (IV + Ciphertext) into the  FIFO registers. Trigger the engine. The hardware pulls the GID key from the fuses, performs the AES-256-CBC unwrap, and pushes the result to the output buffer. Read the unwrapped target key (typically formatted as ) from the  register.Hypothesized Countermeasures:
Modern Apple Silicon (A12+/M1+) implements countermeasures against this oracle usage. Reverse engineering suggests the AES engine may enforce a state machine that requires the output of a GID decryption to be immediately DMA'd to executable memory and jumped to, rather than read back into a general-purpose register. Bypassing this theoretically requires  (voltage glitching) to corrupt the state machine or precise timing attacks to race the hardware's "sanitize on read" logic, allowing the extraction of the plaintext key before the hardware scrubs it.4.0 The Security Monitor Layer (GL1/GL2): The Exclave ArchitectureIn the "Tahoe" architecture, the XNU kernel has been demoted. It no longer possesses the ultimate authority to define the virtual memory layout of the system. That power has been migrated to a hardware-enforced monitor running in a proprietary execution state known as the  (specifically, the Guarded Execution Feature or GXF). This section dissects the mechanics of this new layer, which effectively functions as a silicon-enforced hypervisor for the kernel itself.4.1 The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) - GL2The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) operates at . It is the highest privilege  component on the Application Processor, sitting above both the XNU Kernel (EL2) and the Secure Kernel (GL1). The SPTM is the sole entity permitted to write to the physical pages that constitute the translation tables (TTBR0/TTBR1) for the managed domains of both the Normal and Secure worlds.4.1.1 The  and  Instructions: Context SwitchingTransitions into the SPTM utilize the proprietary  instruction, which performs a synchronous, atomic context switch.
To invoke the SPTM, the kernel populates specific registers and executes the opcode. (Little Endian). The primary control register. It holds the , a 64-bit value encoding the  (e.g., XNU, TXM, SK), the , and the  (function index). The parameters for the call (e.g., physical addresses, permission flags).  is often reserved for the thread stack pointer when relaying calls to the TXM. The 5-bit immediate encoded in the  instruction itself serves as an entry index, selecting the specific GXF entry stub (recorded in ).
Upon execution of : The hardware traps to GL2. The hardware swaps the active Shadow Permission Remapping Register configuration. The memory regions containing the SPTM code and data—previously invisible to the kernel—become Read/Write/Execute. The Stack Pointer () is switched to the  register, pointing to a dedicated secure stack within the SPTM's private memory. Execution jumps to the vector defined in  (or equivalent GL2 vector base).
The SPTM returns control to the kernel using  (). This restores the EL2 SPRR configuration and the kernel's stack pointer. Crucially, on the return path, the SPTM and TXM scrub their per-thread state and shared buffers before executing , ensuring that sensitive GL-only data is not left in registers or shared pages exposed to the kernel.4.1.2 The Frame Table (FTE): Tracking Physical RealityTo enforce security, the SPTM cannot rely on the kernel's data structures (like ), as they are mutable by a compromised kernel. Instead, the SPTM maintains its own "God View" of physical memory called the .The Frame Table is a linear array of Frame Table Entries (FTE), located in SPTM-private memory. There is one FTE for every 16KB page of physical RAM (matching the kernel's translation granule).FTE Structure and Domains:
The FTE tracks the state of every physical page, enforcing strict ownership by  (). While the internal enum values evolve, the conceptual types include: Generic kernel heap/stack. Immutable kernel code. A page containing translation entries (TTEs). Memory owned by the Secure World. (SPTM Domain): Internal monitor structures.
The SPTM enforces that a physical page can only be mapped into a virtual address space if the mapping permissions are compatible with the page's Type and Domain. For example, a page marked  cannot be mapped as Executable. A page marked  cannot be mapped as Writable by the kernel.4.1.3 The Dispatch Table: Reverse Engineering the SelectorsThe interface between XNU and the SPTM is a strict, register-based API. However, unlike the stable syscall numbers of the BSD layer, the  are not guaranteed to remain static across macOS versions. Apple frequently rotates these IDs to frustrate static analysis tools.: The  (Domain + Table + Endpoint).: Arguments (Physical Addresses, Permission Bitmasks, ASIDs).Heuristic Identification:
Since relying on static IDs is brittle, reverse engineers must fingerprint the  of the handler functions within the Ap,SecurePageTableMonitor binary to identify the primitives.sptm_retype(ppn, old_type, new_type): Look for a function that accepts a Physical Page Number (PPN), reads the corresponding Frame Table Entry (FTE), and performs a . The SPTM must zero-fill () or cache-invalidate the page before transitioning it from  to  to prevent the kernel from initializing a page table with pre-computed malicious entries.assert(refcount == 0); memset(pa, 0, PAGE_SIZE); fte->type = new_type;sptm_map(asid, va, ppn, perms): Look for a function that walks the translation tables (reading physical memory) and performs a  against the FTE. It will contain logic that explicitly compares the requested  (e.g., Write) against the  (e.g., ).if (fte->type == XNU_TEXT && (perms & WRITE)) panic(); write_tte(...); Look for the  sequence. For SPTM-controlled mappings, TLB invalidation is performed inside GL2 as part of the unmap routine. XNU cannot directly update those page tables and must invoke SPTM to perform any changes, including the corresponding TLB maintenance ( or similar).sptm_map_iommu(dart_id, context_id, dva, ppn, perms): Look for writes to MMIO regions associated with DART controllers, rather than standard RAM. This function validates that the  is not a protected kernel page before mapping it into a device's IOVA space.
Automated analysis scripts should not rely on . Instead, they should symbolically execute the  handler in the SPTM binary, identifying the dispatch table jump via , and then classify the target functions based on the presence of  (cache zero), , or FTE array access patterns.4.1.4  Analyzing Panic Strings and the State MachineThe SPTM is designed to be . Unlike standard kernel APIs that return , the SPTM treats invalid requests as evidence of kernel compromise.
If XNU sends a malformed request (e.g., trying to retype a page that is still mapped), the SPTM treats this as a fatal security violation. Instead of returning an error code that a compromised XNU could potentially suppress, the SPTM directly initiates the system panic or halt sequence."received fatal error for a selector from TXM" or "invalid state transition". These strings are gold for reverse engineers. They confirm that the SPTM enforces a strict Finite State Machine (FSM) for memory pages.Mapping the State Machine:
By analyzing the panic logic and the allowed transition bitmaps, we can deduce the allowed transitions: →  (Allocation) →  (Retype for MMU use - requires sanitization) →  (Teardown - requires unmapping all entries) →  (KEXT loading - One-way transition!)Any attempt to deviate from this graph (e.g., trying to turn  directly into ) results in an immediate halt. This prevents "Page Table Spraying" and other heap manipulation techniques used to gain kernel execution.4.2 The Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) – GL0If the SPTM is the brawn—enforcing the physics of memory mapping—the Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) is the brains. Operating as a privileged Conclave at , the TXM is the supreme arbiter of system policy. It represents the architectural decoupling of “mechanism” from “policy.” While the SPTM handles  a page is mapped, the TXM decides  it is allowed to be mapped executable under a given policy.4.2.1 Decoupling AMFI: Moving Core Code-Signature VerificationHistorically, the Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI) kernel extension was the primary enforcement point for code signing. While AMFI still exists to handle complex userland policy checks, in the Tahoe architecture the core cryptographic verification logic for platform and protected code has been lifted out of the kernel and placed into the TXM. TXM’s primary currency of trust is the Code Directory Hash (CDHash).The Verification Flow (conceptual): The kernel (XNU) loads a binary into memory (typed as ). It parses the  load command and calculates the CDHash (typically SHA-256 over the Code Directory). XNU issues a call into the Secure World. The Secure Kernel (GL1) routes this to the TXM (GL0). The kernel passes the CDHash and the physical address range that will back the executable mapping. The TXM consults its internal : CDHashes for immutable OS binaries (kernel collections, dyld shared cache, system daemons shipped in Cryptexes).Loadable / Dynamic Trust Caches: CDHashes for binaries that have been verified previously (third-party apps, JIT regions, auxiliary trust caches). On a , the system enters a “cold path”. The kernel, often assisted by  and , provides the CMS signature blob and certificate chain for the image. TXM performs the cryptographic verification against the relevant Apple root (or Developer ID root) inside the guarded world. On success, the CDHash is inserted into an appropriate trust cache. Once the CDHash is validated according to platform policy, TXM updates its internal state so that the specific physical pages associated with that CDHash are marked as “permitted for execution” when requested with appropriate permissions. When XNU later asks the SPTM to map those pages as Executable (), the SPTM consults TXM (or the trust-cache state driven by TXM). If the pages are not in a state that policy allows to become executable, the SPTM denies the Execute permission, even if EL2 code tries to set it in the PTE.Platform distinction (iOS-class vs macOS):The exact  enforced by TXM/SPTM is platform-dependent:On iOS / iPadOS / watchOS / visionOS, TXM + SPTM implement a hard invariant: only code that is both correctly signed and policy-approved is allowed to become executable. AMFI’s view of “signed or not” is no longer sufficient on its own; the SPTM must agree.On , the platform is explicitly designed to allow arbitrary and ad-hoc user code to run. In that environment:TXM still verifies and tracks  (kernel collections, system frameworks, hardened system daemons) and other code that participates in the system integrity story (e.g. components running with special entitlements or under hardened runtime).SPTM still mediates executable mappings and protects the integrity of page tables and immutable kernel/monitor regions.However, the global “no unsigned code ever executes” property is  applied to general userland on macOS. The set of mappings that SPTM/TXM treat as “must be verified” is narrower and aligned with Apple’s documented policy distinction between macOS and fully locked-down platforms.On , patching the kernel to ignore AMFI errors is no longer a sufficient route to arbitrary unsigned code execution: the SPTM/TXM stack must still bless the mapping. Attempts to create executable mappings for code that TXM has not accepted will fail at the SPTM boundary.On , a kernel compromise can still influence which user binaries run (for example, by weakening or bypassing Gatekeeper and AMFI checks for user processes), and ad-hoc binaries remain architecturally admissible. The SPTM/TXM stack primarily constrains:the integrity of page tables and KIP/KTRR-like regions,the mappings of kernel collections and other protected code, andthe ability of a compromised kernel to subvert those invariants.In all cases, SPTM continues to arbitrate frame typing and protected mappings above EL2. TXM’s policy decisions define which code is  for protection and execution under a given mode; SPTM enforces the resulting invariants in the page-table and DART hardware.4.2.2 The Trust Cache: Static vs. LoadableTo avoid the performance penalty of cryptographic verification on every page fault, the TXM manages the —a database of known-good CDHashes.
This is loaded by iBoot and passed to the TXM during the Secure World initialization. It contains the hashes of every binary in the OS (now encapsulated in the immutable ). This cache resides in Secure World memory and is strictly Read-Only.
These handle third-party applications, JIT regions, and auxiliary updates. When a user launches an app, the TXM verifies the signature once and adds the CDHash to a loadable cache. The kernel queries the Trust Cache via a specific  selector. These caches are mutable structures managed by the TXM. A logic bug in the TXM's management of this cache (e.g., a race condition during entry removal or a hash collision attack) is a high-value target for persistence.4.2.3 Developer Mode Enforcement and Downgrade ProtectionThe TXM is also the guardian of the device's security posture, specifically .In previous iterations, enabling debugging capabilities was often a matter of setting  variables or  (like ). In Tahoe, these states are managed by the TXM.
Enabling Developer Mode requires a reboot and explicit user authorization (Secure Intent via physical buttons). The TXM persists this state (likely via the Secure Enclave's secure storage).
The TXM enforces that the system cannot transition from a "Production" state to a "Developer" state without a full reboot and authentication ceremony. This prevents a kernel-level attacker from dynamically relaxing security policies to load unsigned modules.Furthermore, the  (signed by the SEP) encodes whether the system is in Full, Reduced, or Permissive Security. Early-boot components (LLB/iBoot) will refuse to start macOS without a valid LocalPolicy, preventing silent downgrades of security policy. At runtime, the TXM consults this configuration when deciding which code-signing and trust-cache policies to enforce.5.0 XNU Kernel Initialization: Entering GL1The handoff from iBoot to the XNU kernel marks the transition from a single-threaded bootloader to a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operating system. However, in the Tahoe architecture, this is no longer a handover of absolute power. In the Tahoe architecture on M4 silicon, the XNU kernel executes at  (Hardware EL1), while the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) occupies  (Hardware EL2). Consequently, the kernel enters not as a master, but as a guest under the SPTM's supervision.The entry point is defined in . At this precise moment, the system state is fragile: the MMU is operating under a minimal bootstrap mapping provided by iBoot (or disabled entirely depending on the specific SoC generation), interrupts are masked ( bits set), and the stack pointer is essentially arbitrary. The kernel's first objective is to orient itself within physical memory, calculate the KASLR slide, and establish the virtual memory structures required to turn on the lights.5.1 The  routine and KASLRThe  symbol is the architectural entry point. Unlike x86_64, where the kernel might handle its own decompression and relocation, the Apple Silicon kernel is loaded as a raw Mach-O executable (within the  container) directly into physical memory by iBoot.The Register State at Entry:: Indicates EL2 (on standard macOS Tahoe configurations).: Physical address of the  structure (version 2).: Physical address of the Device Tree base (if not inside ).: 0 (Reserved/Empirically observed).: 0 (Reserved/Empirically observed).5.1.1 Deriving the Kernel Slide: The Decoupled Address SpaceKernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) on Apple Silicon is a cooperative effort between iBoot and XNU. iBoot generates a high-entropy value from the TRNG, populates the  property in the Device Tree, and physically relocates the kernel text in DRAM to match this slide.
Upon entry at , the kernel immediately parses the  structure pointed to by . This structure acts as the handover manifest, containing:: The  virtual base address where the kernel is mapped (i.e., the static base plus the slide).: The actual physical load address in DRAM.
The kernel calculates its own slide by comparing the runtime virtual base provided by iBoot against its compile-time static base:$$ \texttt{vm\_kernel\_slide} = \texttt{boot\_args.virtBase} - \texttt{STATIC\_KERNEL\_BASE} $$The Tahoe Constraint: Address Space Decoupling:
In the Tahoe architecture, the system operates under a paradigm of . The SPTM (GL2) and the Kernel (EL2) reside in the same physical DRAM but operate in distinct translation regimes. The kernel runs under  (or  with VHE), with a virtual layout randomized by . The SPTM runs under the  translation regime with its own independent set of translation table base registers.
This separation is critical. A kernel-level memory leak (e.g., an  revealing a kernel pointer) allows an attacker to calculate . In previous architectures, if the monitor (PPL) was mapped at a fixed offset relative to the kernel, a kernel leak would instantly reveal the monitor's location.In Tahoe, knowing  yields  about the virtual address of the SPTM. The SPTM's virtual mapping is established by iBoot in the GL2 context before the kernel executes. While the kernel is aware of the SPTM's  pages (marked as "Reserved" in the memory map), it is architecturally blind to the SPTM's  location.RE Focus: Finding the Slide:
For a reverse engineer with a kernel panic log or a JTAG connection, identifying these slides requires inspecting distinct registers: Inspect  (or  if VHE is active). The translation table base points to the physical location of the kernel's L1 table. The high bits of the PC (Program Counter) at the exception vector reveal the virtual slide. This is invisible from EL2. To find it, one must inspect the GL2-specific TTBRs via JTAG while the core is halted in the GL2 context. The  global variable in XNU is one of the first initialized. In a raw memory dump, locating the  struct (often at the start of a physical page aligned to 16KB) will reveal the  directly.5.1.2 Initializing the MMU:  and the SPTM HandshakeBefore the kernel can execute C code safely, it must enable the Memory Management Unit (MMU). On standard ARMv8, this involves populating translation tables and writing to  and , then setting .On Tahoe, this process is fundamentally altered because the kernel cannot write to its own page tables.
How does the kernel build its initial page tables if it requires the SPTM to map pages, but the SPTM requires the kernel to make hypercalls?The Solution: The Bootstrap Tables:
iBoot installs a minimal set of  before handing off control. These tables typically contain identity mappings for the PC and stack, allowing the kernel to execute the initialization code required to bring up the SPTM interface. The kernel configures the Translation Control Register ().
 Defines the size of the virtual address space (typically 48-bit on macOS). Granule size (16KB is standard for Apple Silicon). Intermediate Physical Address Size (matches the SoC capability, e.g., 40 bits). Typically configured to allow the top byte (bits 63-56) to carry metadata (such as PAC signatures or tags) without affecting address translation.The SPTM Handshake (The First ):
Once  is configured, the kernel must transition from the iBoot-provided bootstrap tables to its own managed tables. The kernel allocates physical pages for the new L1/L2/L3 translation tables from the  pool. The kernel zeroes these pages. The kernel executes  (Selector  - ) to convert these pages from  to . The kernel executes  (Selector  - ) to populate the entries, replicating the kernel text and static data mappings. Finally, the kernel programs the appropriate  (EL1 or EL2 depending on configuration) to point to the new L1 table. The SPTM constrains the actual effect via SPRR/GXF.
The final step of  is writing to the System Control Register (). Set to 1. Set to 1.In Tahoe, writes to  are mediated by GL2/SPTM (via GXF’s control over system registers). GL2 enforces that configurations keep  set, preventing EL2 from creating writable-executable mappings even if compromised. If the kernel attempts to disable , the SPTM rejects the configuration and panics the device.Once the MMU is active and the kernel is running on its own page tables (managed by SPTM), the  routine branches to , beginning the high-level initialization of the BSD subsystem and IOKit.5.2 Hardware Security Enforcements (The "Kill Switch" Registers)As the kernel initialization sequence progresses through , it reaches a critical inflection point. The memory management structures are initialized, and the kernel is about to transition from a setup phase to a runtime phase. To prevent a compromised runtime kernel from modifying its own logic, the initialization routine must engage the hardware "Kill Switches."In the Tahoe architecture, this protection is layered:  provides the physical baseline,  defines the boot-time immutable regions, and the  virtualizes and extends these concepts to enforce dynamic immutability.5.2.1 KTRR (Kernel Text Read-Only Region): The Physical LockKernel Text Read-Only Region (KTRR) is Apple’s hardware solution to the "W^X" (Write XOR Execute) problem at the physical memory controller level. While the MMU (via page tables) controls virtual access permissions, page tables are mutable data structures. KTRR enforces read-only permissions for a physical range corresponding to kernel text, below the level of page tables. Even if an attacker can mutate PTEs, writes into the KTRR physical region are blocked or faulted.
KTRR is controlled via a set of proprietary system registers, typically accessible via  instructions. (): Defines the physical start address of the protected range. (): Defines the physical end address. (): The kill switch. Writing  to the lock bit enables the protection.The Tahoe Evolution (Virtualization of KTRR):
On M3/M4 chips running the SPTM, the kernel's interaction with KTRR changes. It is confirmed that the SPTM virtualizes these registers; writes from the kernel trap to the SPTM at EL2, which strictly validates and rejects unauthorized modifications. When XNU executes the legacy instructions to write to  in , the hardware traps these accesses. The SPTM validates that the kernel is attempting to cover the correct physical range and enforces its own policy, effectively mocking the success of the operation to the kernel while ensuring the hardware is locked down.RE Focus: The KTRR Slide Alignment
Because KTRR operates on physical ranges with large granularity (e.g., 1MB or L2 cache line boundaries), the KASLR slide is forced to align to this granularity. If you are brute-forcing the KASLR slide, knowing the KTRR alignment constraint significantly reduces the entropy search space.5.2.2 Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) and SPTM SealingKTRR protects the static kernel binary (). However, modern macOS relies heavily on the Boot Kernel Collection (BKC) and Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AKC)—large caches of drivers and extensions loaded during boot.
Apple documentation refers to Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) as a hardware feature where the memory controller defines a protected region into which iBoot loads the kernel and kernel extensions, then denies writes after boot. This serves as the static anchor for the BKC.SPTM Dynamic Sealing ():
The SPTM generalizes this concept to support dynamic loading. Unlike static KTRR/KIP regions, the SPTM maintains a  where pages can be typed. During , the kernel links and relocates extensions. The kernel issues a  call (Selector  or ) to "seal" the region. The SPTM updates the Frame Table Entries (FTE) for the physical pages backing the drivers, transitioning them from  (Writable) to  (Executable/Read-Only).
The security invariant enforced here is that memory typed as  is  writable by EL2. If the kernel attempts to write to a sealed page, the  configuration for EL2 triggers a permission fault. This effectively turns the kernel extensions into ROM, mitigating rootkits that historically operated by patching IOKit vtables in memory.5.2.3 The System Control Register () LockdownThe final "Kill Switch" is the configuration of the ARM processor itself. The  register controls the MMU, caches, and alignment checks. Bit 19. When set, any memory region mapped as Writable is implicitly treated as Non-Executable ().The Trap-and-Emulate Policy:
In a standard ARM system, EL2 can modify  at will. In the Tahoe architecture, writes to  are mediated by GL2/SPTM via GXF’s control over system registers. The effective policy under normal operation is that : GL2/SPTM will not accept configurations that clear  to create writable–executable regions. If the kernel attempts to program  with  cleared, the requested configuration is rejected by the monitor and, in current implementations, this manifests as a system panic rather than a silent relaxation of protections. This ensures that the fundamental security properties of the execution environment (in particular W^X) cannot be disabled, even by a compromised kernel.5.3 Exclaves: The Microkernel within the MonolithThe introduction of  in the Tahoe architecture represents the most profound structural change to the Apple OS ecosystem since the transition from Mac OS 9 to OS X. It is an admission that the monolithic kernel architecture (XNU) has become too large, too complex, and too mutable to serve as the ultimate Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for high-value assets.Exclaves introduce a  running side-by-side with the monolithic XNU kernel on the same Application Processor cores. Unlike the Secure Enclave (which is a separate coprocessor), Exclaves harness the full performance of the M-series cores while maintaining cryptographic isolation enforced by the SPTM.5.3.1 The L4 Influence: Domains, Conclaves, and IPCThe architecture of the Exclave system is heavily indebted to the  family. It prioritizes minimalism, capability-based security, and strict isolation.The Hierarchy of Isolation:The Secure Kernel (): A tiny, formally verifiable kernel that manages scheduling and IPC within the secure world. It runs at . The highest level of separation. The "Insecure Domain" hosts XNU and userland (EL2/EL0). The "Secure Domain" hosts Exclave workloads. Within the Secure Domain (GL0), workloads are siloed into . A Conclave is a lightweight container consisting of an address space, a set of capabilities (handles to resources), and threads.Memory Management via SPTM:
The isolation is enforced by the SPTM's Frame Table. Physical pages assigned to an Exclave are typed in the FTE (likely as  or ). The kernel sees these physical pages as "reserved" in the device tree. Any attempt by XNU to map these pages via  will result in a panic, as the SPTM forbids mapping Exclave-owned pages into the .5.3.2  The  Mechanism and For the reverse engineer, the critical question is: How does the Kernel talk to an Exclave? They share no virtual memory, run in different hardware contexts, and the SPTM actively prevents XNU from mapping Exclave physical pages. The bridge is a mechanism internally referred to by researchers as , facilitated by a component named .
Apple has introduced a new Interface Definition Language (IDL) called . It replaces the legacy Mach Interface Generator (MIG) for secure world communication. Tightbeam is strongly typed and buffer-centric. The serialization logic is visible in /usr/lib/libTightbeam.dylib. appears both as an XNU-side component and as related services in the secure world, bridging Mach ports to Exclave endpoints.The Downcall (XNU → Exclave):
When XNU needs a service, it cannot call the function directly. serializes the request using Tightbeam into a shared memory ring buffer. The kernel executes a specific instruction to trigger the world switch. This is a  instruction targeting a specific Dispatch ID reserved for the Secure Kernel. The hardware (mediated by SPTM) saves the EL2 state, switches the SPRR configuration to the Exclave view, and jumps to the  entry point (GL1).The Upcall (Exclave → XNU):
Exclaves rely on XNU for file system I/O or networking.The Exclave writes a request to the outbound ring buffer.It triggers an interrupt or executes a  yield. receives the notification, reads the request, performs the operation via standard VFS calls, and returns the result via a Downcall.Memory Loaning (The "DART" Window):
While control messages go through ring buffers, large data transfers occur via .  pins a userland page and passes its physical address to the Exclave via Tightbeam. The Exclave requests the SPTM to map this specific PPN into its address space. This "Loaned Memory" mechanism is a prime target for TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) attacks, as the ownership transitions are complex and mediated by the SPTM state machine.5.3.3 Use Case: Secure Control of Privacy Indicators and PasskeysThe "Killer App" for Exclaves in macOS Tahoe is the hardware-enforced privacy indicator (the green/orange dots).Reverse engineering of current macOS Tahoe builds strongly suggests that these indicators are implemented using an Exclave-controlled overlay path along the following lines: The physical framebuffer region corresponding to the status bar indicators is, in current implementations,  in the XNU domain. It appears to be owned exclusively by a specific  (GL0), so that only secure-world code can directly address the pixels used for the indicators. The Display Coprocessor's IOMMU (DART) is configured under SPTM control such that the main display pipe used by XNU and WindowServer cannot write to the indicator pixels. Only a secure overlay pipe, controlled by the Exclave domain, is allowed to source scanout data for that region. Under this design, XNU cannot map the physical memory backing the secure overlay, and it cannot reconfigure the relevant DART contexts without going through SPTM policy. As a result, a compromised kernel is effectively unable to erase or suppress the indicator once the secure pipeline has decided it should be visible.
Similarly, passkey operations are increasingly implemented inside Exclave-backed services. The key material for Passkeys is generated and stored in hardware-isolated domains (SEP plus, on newer platforms, Exclave-backed services), with XNU only ever handling opaque identifiers or tokens rather than raw private keys. Even if malware injects code into the  daemon or the kernel, it cannot extract the private key material, because it resides in a memory domain that the Normal World cannot directly address.6.0 The Mach Subsystem: The Nervous SystemWhile the SPTM and Exclaves represent the new fortress walls of the Apple Silicon architecture, the  subsystem remains the internal nervous system that coordinates activity within the XNU kernel. Originating from the NeXTSTEP era, Mach provides the fundamental primitives for Inter-Process Communication (IPC), thread scheduling, and virtual memory management.For the reverse engineer, Mach is the primary vector for local privilege escalation (LPE). Despite decades of hardening, the complexity of state management in Mach messaging remains a fertile ground for logic bugs, race conditions, and reference counting errors. In the Tahoe era, Mach has been retrofitted with heavy PAC enforcement to protect its object graph.6.1 Mach Ports & IPC PrimitivesAt the conceptual level, Mach is an object-oriented kernel. The fundamental unit of addressing is the . To a userland process, a port is merely a 32-bit integer handle (). To the kernel, it is a complex, reference-counted data structure () that acts as a unidirectional communication channel.6.1.1 Port Rights: Receive, Send, Send-Once, and Dead NamesThe security model of Mach is capability-based. Possessing a port name is meaningless without the associated . The kernel tracks these rights in the process's IPC space. The ownership right. Only one task can hold the Receive right for a specific port at any given time. This task is the destination for messages sent to the port.
 The  struct contains a pointer () to the  of the task holding this right. The ability to queue messages into the port. Multiple tasks can hold send rights to the same port. This is the standard "client" handle.MACH_PORT_RIGHT_SEND_ONCE: A "fire-and-forget" right that vanishes after a single message is sent. This is critical for the Request/Reply pattern (RPC). When a client sends a message, it typically includes a  right to its own reply port. The server uses this to send exactly one reply, preventing the server from spamming the client later.MACH_PORT_RIGHT_DEAD_NAME: If the task holding the Receive right dies or destroys the port, all outstanding Send rights in other tasks are instantly transmuted into Dead Names. Any attempt to send a message to a dead name returns .RE Focus: The  Structure and PAC:
In previous generations, a common exploit technique involved "Fake Ports"—spraying the heap with crafted data that looked like an  struct and then tricking the kernel into using it.In the arm64e/Tahoe architecture, the  structure is heavily fortified: The base header of the port. A pointer to the underlying kernel object (e.g., a task, a thread, or a user-client). This pointer is PAC-signed. A 64-bit context value, also PAC-signed.If an attacker attempts to forge a port, they must generate a valid signature for the  pointer. Without the  (Data Key A), the kernel will panic upon  execution during message delivery.6.1.2 The IPC Space () and the Global Name ServerEvery task (process) in macOS has an associated  (). This structure acts as the translation layer between userland integer handles () and kernel objects (, , etc.).The Translation Table ():
Each IPC space is backed by a dynamically sized array of  (), commonly referred to as the  / .
The userland handle (e.g. ) encodes:A  into the , andHigh-order generation bits used to detect stale handles.
Each entry contains (simplified):: A pointer to the underlying  or . On arm64e/Tahoe, this pointer is protected with pointer authentication (PAC) so that corruption of the raw bits does not yield a usable kernel pointer.: A bitfield encoding:Rights (send, receive, send-once, etc.).The generation count for that slot.Additional flags (e.g. dead-name state).The Lookup Process ():
When a thread executes  to send to some :The kernel retrieves the current task’s IPC space:ipc_space_t space = current_task()->itk_space;It decodes the  to obtain the index and generation and indexes into .Generation matches the high bits of the name?Required right present (e.g.  for a send).On arm64e, it authenticates the  pointer using the appropriate kernel PAC key and context.If all checks succeed, it obtains the  and proceeds with message delivery.This indirection is what allows the kernel to revoke or recycle ports while making stale userland handles harmless: the generation mismatch will cause lookups to fail instead of returning the wrong object.
Mach itself does  implement a string-based global namespace in the kernel. The kernel only knows about ports and rights; it does not know what  means.The mapping from string service names →  is implemented entirely in userland by the , which on macOS is .
The kernel does maintain a small set of “special ports” on host and task objects. Relevant here:: A send right representing the host ().: The privileged host port (see Section 6.2).: The task’s handle to the bootstrap server (typically a port managed by  for that task’s domain).bootstrap_look_up(bootstrap_port, "com.apple.foo", &service_port);
or uses the XPC equivalent, it is really sending a Mach message to whatever port is stored in its  slot.  receives that message and resolves  into a Mach port according to its internal job graph and policy.6.1.3 Copy-on-Write (CoW) optimizations in Out-of-Line (OOL) message passingMach messages are not limited to small scalars. They can transfer massive amounts of data using  descriptors. This mechanism relies on Virtual Memory (VM) tricks rather than data copying, making it highly efficient but historically dangerous. Includes a mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t in the message, pointing to a buffer in its address space (e.g., 100MB of data). The kernel does  copy the 100MB. Instead, it walks the sender's VM map. The kernel marks the physical pages backing that buffer as  in the sender's map. The kernel maps those  into the receiver's address space, also as . If either the sender or receiver tries to write to the buffer, the MMU triggers a fault. The kernel catches this, allocates a new physical page, copies the data, and updates the mapping for the writer. This preserves the illusion of a copy.The Tahoe/SPTM Intersection:
In the Tahoe architecture, this VM manipulation is complicated by the SPTM. When the kernel marks the pages as CoW (Read-Only), it cannot simply update the PTEs. It must issue a  call ( or ) to the SPTM to downgrade the permissions of the physical pages in the sender's address space. This complexity introduces a race window. If the kernel logic fails to correctly lock the VM map object before requesting the SPTM update, or if the SPTM state machine has a logic flaw regarding shared pages (), it might be possible to modify the physical page  the message has been "sent" but before the receiver reads it. This is known as a  or Physically-Backed-Virtually-Disjoint attack.
Analyze  and  in the XNU source (or binary). Look for how  structures are flagged with  and how these flags translate into SPTM calls. The interaction between Mach IPC (which assumes it controls VM) and the SPTM (which actually controls VM) is the friction point where new bugs will likely emerge.In the lexicon of XNU exploitation, the  () has historically been synonymous with “Game Over.” It is  the kernel task port itself; rather, it is a privileged Mach port on the global  () that unlocks host-level operations and special ports. In older exploitation chains,  was often the stepping stone to obtain a send right to  (TFP0) via interfaces such as  or .6.2.1 The “God Mode” Handle: Generation and RestrictionThe  port is backed by the kernel’s global  (). Unlike a task port, which maps to a , the  port is a privileged view of the host object that unlocks host-level operations (for example, access to special ports and certain system configuration controls).During early bootstrap in , XNU initializes the host subsystem:
Allocates and initializes the  structure.
Calls  (or equivalent helpers) to create the Mach port for the host.
Associates the  pointer with the port’s  / context fields.The  (or related kobject pointer) is stored as a PAC-signed kernel pointer, using one of the kernel’s data-pointer keys with the port address (or similar) as context.This prevents simple “write some other kernel address into ” attacks, even given a raw kernel read/write primitive: tampered pointers will not authenticate when used.The system is conservative about who gets . Typical holders are:
Owns the receive right for the host-privileged port.Privileged daemons (for example, , ):
Obtain send rights to  via host_get_host_priv_port() or the special-port mechanism, so they can:manage special ports (, ), andperform host-level operations on behalf of the rest of the system.The exact set of daemons that receive  can vary by OS release, but it is a very small, explicitly entitled group.The “TFP0” chain in TahoeHistorically, a common pattern was:host_get_host_priv_port(mach_host_self(), &host_priv);
task_for_pid(mach_task_self(), 0, &kernel_task_port);
On modern macOS / Tahoe, several layers weaken this chain: and SIP:
Even if a caller presents ,  is gated by System Integrity Protection (SIP) and related policy hooks. With SIP enabled, conversion to  is denied for untrusted callers.Immutable kernel regions via KIP/SPTM:
Even if an attacker somehow:bypasses SIP/task conversion checks, andobtains a  port,the system’s integrity protections still constrain what that port can do safely:code pages in the Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) region are loaded and marked read-only by iBoot/SPTM,page tables and “data-const” regions are protected by SPTM frame typing,attempts to use  /  to modify such protected regions can trigger integrity violations and system panic rather than giving persistent arbitrary code execution.In effect, on Tahoe-era systems,  is a high-leverage control primitive and a prerequisite for a number of powerful operations, but it is no longer, by itself, a trivial “write-anywhere in kernel text” primitive once KIP/SPTM and SIP are taken into account.6.2.2 Task Special Ports: The Privileged DirectoryWhile  itself is restricted, it is also the gateway into a table of  that act as privileged entry points for various subsystems. These ports are accessed via  and .Internally, the  structure maintains an array such as:ipc_port_t special[HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_PORT + 1];
where specific indices are reserved for particular subsystems.Critical special ports (by name)A non-exhaustive set of important host special ports:
Port used by the kernel to talk to the automounter () to initiate filesystem mounts.
Control port for the sandbox subsystem ( / ). Possession of this port gives a daemon the ability to receive sandbox configuration and policy messages.
Port used for communicating with the kernel extension manager ( / ). Historically has been involved in flows that could be abused to force loading of kexts; on Tahoe, these flows are constrained by driver signing, KCs, and TXM/LocalPolicy.
Port used to talk to the Apple Mobile File Integrity daemon () for code-signing validation requests.The actual numeric IDs (indices into ) for these ports are defined in headers like  and are  simple small integers like 1 or 7; they are offsets from HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_KERNEL_PORT. For most reverse-engineering and exploitation work, the symbolic names and behaviors matter more than the concrete index values.RE Focus: The  trapA classic post-exploitation idea is:Overwrite a host special port (e.g. the KEXTD port) with a port you control, so you can intercept kernel upcalls intended for that subsystem.If an attacker can get  and then call:host_set_special_port(host_priv,
                      HOST_KEXTD_PORT,
                      attacker_port);
the kernel will now send all “kextd” notifications to  instead.Mitigations in modern macOS include:Entitlement and policy gating: is restricted:It requires a host-privileged port.It is further gated by entitlements and code-signing checks; in practice, only  and a very small number of highly privileged system daemons are allowed to call it successfully.Confused-deputy / race hardening:
Attackers therefore look for:Bugs that allow racing or bypassing entitlement checks.Confused-deputy situations where a daemon that  have the entitlement can be coerced into calling  with an attacker-controlled port name.From a reversing perspective, mapping which daemons hold both  and the relevant private entitlements is a critical part of understanding the real attack surface around .6.2.3  Fuzzing Mach Message Parsing (MIG)Since  exposes a wide attack surface via the Mach IPC interface, it is a primary target for fuzzing. The kernel handles these messages using the Mach Interface Generator (MIG).The  Routine:
When a message is sent to , the kernel's IPC dispatcher calls . This is an auto-generated function that deserializes the Mach message and dispatches it to the implementation (e.g., ).Vulnerability Classes in MIG: MIG relies on the message header to define the size and type of arguments. If the userland client sends a malformed message (e.g., claiming a descriptor is OOL memory when it is actually inline data), the kernel's unmarshaling logic might misinterpret the data, leading to heap corruption.Reference Counting Leaks: If a MIG routine returns an error (e.g., )  it has incremented the reference count on a port or VM object but  it consumes it, the object leaks. In the kernel, this can lead to a refcount overflow (though 64-bit refcounts make this hard) or a Use-After-Free if the cleanup logic is flawed. As discussed in Section 6.1.3, if the message includes Out-of-Line memory, the kernel maps it Copy-on-Write. If the MIG handler verifies the content of the memory and then uses it later, the userland process might be able to race the kernel and modify the physical page (via a side-channel or SPTM state confusion) between the check and the use.
In the Tahoe kernel, MIG-generated code has been hardened with . The dispatch tables used by  are signed. The  structure (representing the message in flight) is heavily protected to prevent modification of the message contents after validation but before processing.However, logic bugs in the  of the host calls (the C functions called by MIG) remain reachable. For example,  allows manipulating CPU sets. If the logic fails to account for a processor being in a low-power state or being managed by an Exclave, it could trigger an inconsistent state in the scheduler.7.0 IOKit & Driver ArchitectureWhile the Mach subsystem provides the primitives for IPC and scheduling,  provides the object-oriented framework for device drivers. Historically, IOKit has been the "soft underbelly" of the XNU kernel. Written in a restricted subset of C++, it relies heavily on virtual function dispatch, complex inheritance hierarchies, and manual reference counting (/).In the Tahoe architecture, IOKit has undergone a radical hardening process. The transition to Apple Silicon has allowed Apple to enforce strict Control Flow Integrity (CFI) on C++ objects using PAC, while Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) enforces the immutability of the driver code itself, with the  protecting the page tables that describe those regions.The initialization of IOKit is the bridge between the static hardware description provided by iBoot (the Device Tree) and the dynamic, runtime object graph that constitutes the macOS driver environment.7.1.1 The IORegistry: Populating the Device Tree into C++ ObjectsWhen the kernel boots, the hardware topology is described by the Flattened Device Tree (FDT). Unlike previous architectures where the FDT pointer might have been passed in a raw register, in the current XNU ABI, the FDT pointer is stored in the  field of the  structure, which is passed in  to the kernel entry point . IOKit's first major task is to hydrate this binary blob into a live graph of  objects.
The bootstrap process is driven by the  class (specifically  on Apple Silicon). The kernel parses the FDT. For every node in the tree (e.g., , , ), it instantiates an . These objects are attached to the  plane of the Registry. This plane represents the physical topology as reported by iBoot. Properties from the FDT (like , , ) are converted into , , or  objects and attached to the registry entries.Matching and Driver Loading:
Once the Registry is populated, IOKit begins the  phase (). IOKit iterates over the registry entries. It compares the  property (e.g., ) against the  dictionary defined in the  of every loaded driver.The Probe/Start Lifecycle: When a match is found, the driver's C++ class is instantiated.
: The driver verifies the hardware is actually present (rarely used on SoCs where hardware is static).: The driver initializes the hardware, maps MMIO regions, and registers interrupts.RE Focus: The "Missing" Hardware:
On Tahoe systems, empirical observation reveals gaps in the IORegistry compared to the raw Device Tree. The SPTM and TXM reserve specific hardware blocks (e.g., the Secure Storage controller or specific GPIO banks for privacy LEDs). While not explicitly documented as an SPTM feature, reverse engineering suggests that during the unflattening process, nodes corresponding to physical ranges reserved by the SPTM are omitted from the . This effectively makes secure hardware invisible to the OS, preventing the kernel from even attempting to map the MMIO registers for these protected blocks.7.1.2 Boot, System, and Auxiliary Kernel CollectionsGone are the days of loading individual  bundles directly from /System/Library/Extensions at boot. To optimize startup and enforce stronger integrity guarantees, macOS now uses .Boot Kernel Collection (BKC)The  is a large, prelinked Mach-O, delivered as an Image4 payload (commonly labeled ):All “essential” drivers required to:Initialize low-level hardware.Mount the root filesystem.Bring up enough of the graphics/console stack to start userland and show the boot UI.
All included kexts are prelinked against the kernel:Symbol resolution is performed at build-time.No relocations or link-edit work is needed in the early boot path.
The BKC is loaded by iBoot into a region managed by Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) and the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM):The physical pages backing BKC code are tracked and locked down before XNU runs.Page-table entries mapping these frames are subject to SPTM policy: kernel attempts to make them writable or executable in unexpected ways can be blocked or cause a panic.This makes kernel text and core boot drivers effectively immutable from EL1, even if an attacker gains .System Kernel Collection (SystemKC)The  holds additional Apple-provided drivers that are not strictly required to mount root or start :Examples include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, audio, and other device drivers.Like the BKC, SystemKC contents are:Signed by Apple and loaded from the immutable System volume.Covered by the same KIP/SPTM enforcement model once mapped.Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AuxKC)The  is the “expansion slot”:Apple-signed kexts that are treated as auxiliary (e.g. optional features, development-only drivers). (userland) is responsible for assembling and signing an Auxiliary KC based on currently-installed third-party drivers.It then asks the kernel to load this collection at runtime once the system is up enough to trust userland decisions.Verification and sealing:The kernel verifies the AuxKC’s signature.On Tahoe-era systems, this verification is tied into TXM / LocalPolicy:Policy must allow third-party kexts in the current boot configuration.The AuxKC’s provenance and contents must satisfy platform rules.Once accepted, the pages for the AuxKC are mapped and then “sealed”:Their mappings transition to code-like protections under SPTM.After sealing, they are enforced similarly to BKC/SystemKC code (immutable from the kernel’s own point of view).For reverse engineering and exploitation:Have stable offsets relative to the kernel slide once you know the collection layout.Live in regions that are protected early and rarely change at runtime.Are loaded later and can have randomized placement.Traverse kernel data structures (, KC descriptors) at runtime to find their base addresses.Account for the fact that their text regions are still covered by SPTM after sealing, even though they arrived late.7.1.3  PAC-signing of C++ Vtables () and The  class is the root of the IOKit inheritance hierarchy. In C++, dynamic dispatch is handled via —arrays of function pointers. Historically, attackers would overwrite the vtable pointer in an object to point to a fake vtable controlled by the attacker (vtable hijacking).In the arm64e architecture, Apple has fundamentally altered the C++ ABI for kernel code to mitigate this.The Signed Vtable Pointer:
In a standard C++ object, the first 8 bytes are the pointer to the vtable. In XNU on arm64e, this pointer is . The salt is 0. Implementations consistently use a zero context (salt=0) for the object's vtable pointer () to support standard C++ semantics like  and . This allows objects to be moved in memory without needing to resign the . Address-based diversity is applied to the function pointers  the vtable, not to the  itself.
$$ \texttt{SignedPtr} = \texttt{PAC}(\texttt{VtableAddr}, \texttt{Key=APDA}, \texttt{Context}=0) $$The Signed Vtable Entries:
The function pointers  the vtable are signed using the  (Instruction Key A). The salt incorporates the entry's storage address and a hash of the mangled method name. This prevents moving entries between vtables.
When the kernel calls a virtual function (e.g., ), the compiler emits a specialized instruction sequence:LDR     x0, [x20]       ; Load the object pointer
LDR     x16, [x0]       ; Load the signed vtable pointer
AUTDA   x16, xzr        ; Authenticate Data Key A, Context = 0 (per docs)
LDR     x10, [x16, #0x18] ; Load the target function pointer from the vtable
BLRAA   x10, x16        ; Branch with Link, Authenticating Key A, Context = Vtable Address
Note the two-stage authentication: Authenticates that the vtable pointer is valid. If the pointer was overwritten,  becomes a canonical non-valid pointer. The function pointers  the vtable are also signed. The  instruction authenticates the function pointer (using the vtable address as context) and branches.
This creates a chain of trust:The Object trusts the Vtable Pointer (via ).The Vtable trusts the Function Pointers (via ).KIP/SPTM trusts the Vtable Memory (via code immutability).For a reverse engineer, this means that patching a vtable in memory is impossible (KIP/SPTM), and forging an object requires the ability to sign pointers with the —a capability that requires a "Signing Oracle" gadget, which BTI aims to eliminate.The introduction of DriverKit represents a strategic retreat for the XNU kernel. For decades, the kernel’s attack surface was effectively the sum of the core kernel plus every third-party driver loaded into the address space. A vulnerability in a Wacom tablet driver or a USB-to-Serial adapter was functionally identical to a vulnerability in the scheduler: both yielded  code execution.DriverKit bifurcates this model by moving hardware drivers into userland, executing as System Extensions (). While they look and feel like drivers to the developer (using a C++ subset similar to Embedded C++), architecturally they are unprivileged processes. In the Tahoe architecture, this isolation is not merely a sandbox; it is a hardware-enforced chasm guarded by the TXM and SPTM.7.2.1 Moving drivers to userland:  and Entitlement ChecksA  is an ordinary userland process (usually running as root but confined by a dedicated sandbox and entitlements). It has no direct access to the kernel’s task port and can only exercise kernel functionality via  interfaces that the kernel explicitly exposes.
When a  is matched and loaded (managed by ), the kernel instantiates a shadow object known as . This kernel-side object acts as the proxy for the userland driver. When the kernel needs to call a function in the driver (e.g., ), it calls a method on . serializes the arguments into a specialized Mach message format (distinct from standard MIG). The message is sent to the  process. The DriverKit runtime (linked into the ) deserializes the message and invokes the implementation of the  subclass in userland.The  Interface:
Conversely, when the  needs to talk to the kernel (e.g., to register an interrupt handler or map memory), it cannot call kernel APIs directly. It uses . The  can only invoke a specific subset of kernel functionality exposed via  traps. These traps are heavily scrutinized. Interrupts are no longer handled via ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) in the driver. Instead, the kernel handles the physical IRQ, masks it, and dispatches an  event to the  via a Mach notification. This eliminates the entire class of vulnerabilities related to interrupt context safety and spinlock deadlocks in third-party code.Entitlements as the Gatekeeper (TXM Enforcement):
In Tahoe, the ability of a  to bind to specific hardware is governed by . A  cannot simply  any MMIO region. It must possess specific entitlements (e.g., com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb) to access specific device families. When  launches a , the system verifies its signature and entitlements against LocalPolicy and trust caches. On SPTM/TXM-equipped systems, these checks are enforced below XNU, so a compromised  cannot bypass them. If the TXM returns a failure, the kernel refuses to establish the  link, and the driver fails to start.RE Focus: The  Metaclass:
Reverse engineering a  requires understanding the  infrastructure in userland. The  binary contains  information that describes the RPC interface. By parsing the  sections, one can reconstruct the vtables and the mapping between the kernel-side dispatch IDs and the userland C++ methods.7.2.2 Memory Mapping Constraints and IOMMU (DART) ProtectionThe most dangerous capability of a driver is Direct Memory Access (DMA). A malicious or buggy driver could program a peripheral (like a GPU or Network Card) to write data to physical address  (or wherever the kernel text resides), bypassing CPU-enforced protections like KTRR.To mitigate this, Apple Silicon employs a pervasive IOMMU architecture known as DART (Device Address Resolution Table).
Every DMA-capable peripheral on the SoC sits behind a DART. The device does not see Physical Addresses (PA); it sees I/O Virtual Addresses (IOVA). The DART translates IOVA → PA, enforcing permissions (Read/Write) at the page level. When a  allocates a buffer for DMA, it creates an . The  calls IOMemoryDescriptor::CreateMapping. This triggers a call into the kernel. The kernel allocates physical pages () and pins them. The kernel programs the DART associated with the specific hardware device controlled by the . It maps the physical pages to an IOVA range visible to that device.The Tahoe/SPTM Enforcement:
In the Tahoe architecture, the kernel is no longer trusted to program the DARTs directly. If the kernel could write to DART registers, it could map the kernel's own text segment as writable to the GPU, then tell the GPU to overwrite it (a DMA attack). The physical pages containing the DART translation tables (or the MMIO registers controlling the DART) are typed as  or a specific hardware-protected type in the Frame Table.The  Selector: When the kernel needs to map a buffer for a , it issues a  call to the SPTM. The SPTM verifies that the physical pages being mapped are  by the  (or are valid shared memory). It strictly forbids mapping any page typed , , or  into a DART. The SPTM performs the write to the DART hardware.MMIO Mapping Restrictions:
Similarly, when a  needs to control hardware registers (MMIO), it requests a mapping.The kernel cannot simply map physical device memory into the 's address space. The SPTM only honors MMIO mapping requests that target ranges it recognizes as device registers for the given driver or device; ranges associated with secure components (SEP, KTRR controller) are excluded.This ensures that a USB driver can  map the USB controller's registers, and cannot map the registers for the Secure Enclave Mailbox or the KTRR controller.
Exploiting a  to gain kernel privileges is exponentially harder in Tahoe. Even if you gain code execution in the  (Userland), you cannot issue arbitrary syscalls (sandbox), you cannot map kernel memory (VM isolation), and you cannot use the hardware device to perform DMA attacks against the kernel (SPTM-enforced DART). The attacker is contained within a hardware-enforced cage, limited to the specific capabilities of that one peripheral.7.3 The Graphics Stack (AGX)If the XNU kernel is the central nervous system, the  stack is a secondary, alien brain grafted onto the SoC. On M-series silicon, the GPU is not merely a peripheral; it is a massive, autonomous compute cluster running its own proprietary operating system, managing its own memory translation, and executing a command stream that is almost entirely opaque to the main OS.For the reverse engineer, AGX represents the largest and most complex attack surface in the kernel. The driver () is enormous, the firmware is encrypted (until load), and the hardware interface is undocumented. In the Tahoe architecture, Apple has moved to aggressively sandbox this beast, wrapping the GPU's memory access in strict DART (Device Address Resolution Table) policies enforced by the SPTM to prevent DMA-based kernel compromises.7.3.1 RTKit: The Proprietary RTOS running on the GPU Coprocessor (ASC)The GPU does not execute driver commands directly. Instead, the M-series SoC includes a dedicated Apple Silicon Coprocessor (ASC)—typically a hardened ARMv8-R or Cortex-M class core—that manages the GPU hardware. This coprocessor runs , Apple’s proprietary Real-Time Operating System.
The kernel driver does not contain the logic to drive the GPU hardware registers directly. Instead, upon initialization (), it loads a firmware payload from a firmware bundle on disk or embedded in the kext. The firmware is a standard Mach-O binary, often multi-architecture. It contains  and  segments just like a userland program. Reverse engineering the firmware reveals a microkernel architecture. It has a scheduler, an IPC mechanism, and a set of "Endpoints" (services).
Communication between the XNU kernel () and the ASC () occurs via a shared memory mailbox protocol. The AP writes to a specific MMIO register to ring the doorbell of the ASC. The message payload is placed in a shared memory ring buffer. The protocol is endpoint-based. Reverse engineering identifies specific service IDs running on the ASC, such as:
 Power Management (Voltage/Clock gating). Graphics Rendering (Command submission). Compute (GPGPU/Metal).RE Focus: The  State Machine:
The  contains extensive logging strings and state tracking for RTKit. By analyzing the  class in the kext, one can reconstruct the message structures. When the GPU hangs, RTKit writes a "Coredump" to a shared buffer. The kernel captures this. Analyzing these logs reveals the internal memory layout of the ASC and the state of the GPU pipeline at the time of the crash. Historically, vulnerabilities existed where the kernel could send malformed IPC messages to the ASC, causing memory corruption  the GPU firmware. While this doesn't directly yield Kernel R/W, compromising the ASC allows an attacker to use the GPU as a confused deputy for DMA attacks (see 7.3.3).While  handles rendering,  (IOMFB) handles the display controller (DCP). This driver is responsible for the "Swap Chain"—taking the rendered frames and scanning them out to the display panel.The Unified Memory Architecture (UMA):
On Apple Silicon, the Framebuffer is just a region of system DRAM.  (userland) renders into an . The physical pages backing this surface are passed to IOMFB, which programs the Display Coprocessor (DCP) to read from them.The Security Criticality:
IOMFB is a high-value target because it handles complex shared memory structures () mapped into both the kernel and userland (). The  method and external methods of IOMobileFramebufferUserClient have historically been riddled with race conditions and bounds-checking errors.Tahoe and the "Secure Overlay":
In the Tahoe architecture, IOMFB's control over the display is no longer absolute. To support the Hardware Privacy Indicators (Green/Orange dots), reverse engineering suggests the display pipeline has been bifurcated. Managed by IOMFB/WindowServer. Draws the desktop/apps. Managed by an . Draws the privacy indicators.
The compositing of these two pipes happens in the display hardware, not in memory.The Exclave owns a small, reserved framebuffer region.The Display Controller overlays this region on top of the standard framebuffer . Because the Secure Pipe's framebuffer memory is owned by the Exclave (and protected by the SPTM), neither the kernel nor the GPU can write to it. This guarantees that if the camera is on, the green dot  be visible, even if the kernel is compromised.7.3.3 DART: The IOMMU Wall and DMA ContainmentThe GPU is effectively a DMA engine with the capability to read and write vast swathes of system memory. Without restriction, a compromised GPU firmware (or a malicious shader exploiting a GPU hardware bug) could overwrite kernel text or page tables.To prevent this, the AGX hardware—and indeed every DMA-capable peripheral on the Apple Silicon SoC—sits behind a strict IOMMU known as the DART (Device Address Resolution Table).DART Architecture and Stream IDs (SIDs):
The DART translates Device Virtual Addresses (DVA) used by the peripheral into  in DRAM. However, the translation is not monolithic; it is segmented by the source of the traffic. Every transaction on the SoC's Network-on-Chip (NoC) carries a hardware-generated Stream ID identifying the initiator (e.g., GPU Firmware, Vertex Fetcher, Display Controller). The DART maintains multiple translation contexts (similar to distinct  roots). The DART hardware is configured to map specific SIDs to specific Context Banks. This allows isolation between different workloads on the same peripheral (e.g., isolating  rendering commands from a background compute shader).The Tahoe Enforcement (SPTM):
In pre-Tahoe systems, the kernel ( or ) managed the DART page tables and the SID configuration registers directly. This meant a kernel attacker could disable DART, remap SIDs to privileged contexts, or map kernel memory into the GPU's address space to bypass KTRR.In Tahoe, DART management is privileged to the SPTM. The physical pages containing the DART translation tables (L1/L2 TTEs) and the MMIO registers controlling SID configuration are typed as  (or a specific IOMMU_TABLE type) in the Frame Table. When  needs to map a user's  for GPU access:
It issues a  call (Selector ).It passes the DART ID, the Context ID, the DVA, and the PA. The SPTM verifies:
The PA is valid  (not Kernel Text, not Page Tables).The DART ID corresponds to the GPU. Crucially, the SPTM enforces the immutable binding between SIDs and Contexts. It ensures that the kernel cannot reconfigure the DART to allow an untrusted SID (e.g., the Neural Engine) to write to a Context Bank reserved for the Secure Enclave or Display Pipe. The SPTM writes the DART PTE.RE Focus: The "GART" Attack Surface:
Despite SPTM protection, the logic  the mapping still resides in the kernel. Can the kernel trick the SPTM into mapping the same physical page to two different DART contexts with different permissions? Does the SPTM correctly flush the DART TLB () immediately after unmapping? If not, the GPU might retain access to a page that has been freed and reallocated to the kernel, leading to a Use-After-Free via DMA. The DART configuration registers (e.g., , , and SID match registers) are trapped by the hardware to GL2. Attempting to write to the DART control base address from EL1 should trigger a synchronous exception. Reverse engineering the  class in IOKit will reveal the specific  trampolines used to bridge these operations.8.0 Userland Bootstrap: The Birth of PID 1The initialization of the XNU kernel culminates in mounting the root filesystem (the Signed System Volume) and creating the first userland process. In traditional UNIX systems, this is  (PID 1). On macOS, this role is fulfilled by . is not just a SysV-style init. It is:The  that manages the lifecycle of daemons and agents.The , providing the string-to-port name service for most of userland.A central  for IPC visibility and service availability.In the Tahoe architecture,  is also the first long-lived user process to run under the full scrutiny of the Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) and associated integrity mechanisms. Its successful launch marks the handoff from the measured, firmware-controlled boot world to the userland environment.8.1 : The Mach Port BrokerThe transition from kernel mode to user mode is effectively one-way for the thread that becomes PID 1: once it crosses into userland, it never returns to the kernel in its original identity.After early initialization in  (mounting root, bringing up the BSD subsystem), the kernel:Spawns a special kernel thread (often referred to conceptually as the ).Uses  to:Allocate  (PID 1) and its backing .Load the  Mach-O binary into that task via . becomes the root of the userland process tree.All subsequent processes are, ultimately, descendants of PID 1.’s management of Mach ports and bootstrap namespaces becomes the primary mechanism by which services discover each other and enforce IPC-based policy.8.1.1 Transition from Kernel to Userland: The First The kernel routine  (in ) orchestrates the end of early boot:
It ensures the Signed System Volume is mounted and ready.PID 1 construction ( / ):
The kernel:Creates  as PID 1 by cloning from the kernel’s internal template process, with special flags ().Allocates the corresponding  and thread structures. – kernel-side  of :
Instead of a user process calling execve("/sbin/launchd", ...), the kernel:Loads the Mach-O for  (backed in modern systems by the OS Cryptex, even though the path appears as ).Constructs the initial user address space:Sets up the initial user thread state (PC, stack, registers) as if an  had just succeeded.Trust and integrity checks (conceptual model):
On Tahoe systems:The code signature and CDHash of  are validated against the Static Trust Cache and platform policy.TXM/SPTM participate in ensuring that:Only a measured, signed  binary becomes PID 1.Its text pages are mapped in a way that respects kernel integrity protection (no ad-hoc remapping to writable/executable later without violating SPTM policy).The exact firmware call sequence is implementation detail, but the net effect is: if  is not exactly the expected, signed binary, the system does not proceed into userland.As part of bringing up the userland environment:The system needs a trusted process that can:Talk to host-level interfaces (, etc.).Manage systemwide services and kext/kc configuration. is that process. During or shortly after PID 1 construction:The kernel ensures that  can obtain the  () by:Providing a host send right via initial special ports, orAllowing  to call host_get_host_priv_port() successfully.Subsequent privileged daemons (e.g. ) obtain their own host-level capabilities via -mediated configuration or direct  calls, subject to entitlements. is therefore the first userland holder of host-level control needed to configure the rest of the system, but it is not necessarily the only holder for the entire lifetime of the OS.8.1.2 Initializing the Bootstrap Port (Subset of the Name Service)Mach does not provide any built-in string-based name service. Name→port mappings are implemented in userland by the bootstrap server, which on macOS is .Bootstrap port assignmentEvery task in XNU has a special port slot, . For PID 1:When  is created, the kernel associates a bootstrap server port with ’s .For child processes spawned by , this slot is:Inherited from the parent, orReplaced with a more restricted bootstrap port representing a subset namespace (e.g. per-user or per-session domain).From userland’s perspective: in the  APIs (and the default XPC bootstrap connection) is whatever send right is stored in .Namespace hierarchy (domains)Modern  organizes the bootstrap namespace into , which correspond roughly to what  exposes as specifiers: – The system-wide daemon domain (LaunchDaemons, root services). – Per-UID domains for LaunchAgents. – GUI domains for interactive sessions per user. or  – Per-login/per-ASID domains for specific authenticated sessions.Its own subset of registered service names.Its own set of policies controlling access and visibility.All of these domains ultimately terminate in the same PID-1  process, but they appear as distinct bootstrap ports and namespaces from the point of view of tasks.The bootstrap port in practiceWhen a daemon is launched, it typically:Receives a bootstrap port (for its domain) in its .bootstrap_check_in(bootstrap_port,
                   "com.apple.locationd",
                   &service_port);
 receives this message on the appropriate domain’s bootstrap port and:Verifies, via the audit token, that the caller is the process associated with the job for .Transfers the receive right for the pre-allocated service port into the daemon’s IPC space.Use  or xpc_connection_create_mach_service() on  bootstrap port. resolves the name in the caller’s domain and either:Returns a send right to the service port, orFails with an error if the service does not exist or is not visible in that domain.Implements the lazy, on-demand launch of services.Enforces which names exist and are reachable in each domain, with  as the central broker.8.1.3 Parsing  and the Binary Protocol for XPC Service Lookups’s configuration is driven by property lists () describing jobs, located under:/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/System/Library/LaunchAgentsPer-user equivalents under At startup (and when configuration changes),  parses these plists once and compiles them into an internal data structure representing:Jobs (labels, binaries, arguments, environments).Their target domain (system/user/gui/login).Policy metadata (KeepAlive, RunAtLoad, sockets, etc.).The  dictionaryA typical job might include:<key>MachServices</key>

In the macOS ecosystem,  is not merely a library loader; it is a privileged extension of the kernel’s execution model, responsible for:Loading the main executable and its dependent images.Enforcing  policies.Applying Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).On arm64e, integrating with Pointer Authentication (PAC).On Apple Silicon and in the Tahoe architecture,  has been heavily reworked. Legacy rebasing mechanisms have been replaced with  to enable page-in linking, and ’s decisions are tightly coupled with the kernel’s memory management, which itself is constrained by the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM).8.2.1 Mapping the Dyld Shared Cache (DSC)The  is a defining feature of the macOS userland memory layout. It is a massive, pre-linked binary (often >4 GiB) that merges the text and data segments of most system frameworks (, , , etc.).To optimize memory and TLB usage, the kernel reserves a  in every process:On arm64, this region typically begins at a high canonical address (e.g., around  in current releases).The DSC is mapped into this region, and the backing physical pages are shared across all processes.To satisfy  and fine-grained data protection, the DSC is split into multiple mappings:
Immutable code and constant data that must never be written at runtime.
Read-only data that can be pre-relocated at build time and never changes at runtime (e.g., constant pointers, vtables).
Data that must diverge per process (e.g., Objective-C class realization state, global variables).The Tahoe/SPTM Constraint:On Tahoe systems, the mapping of the DSC is mediated by SPTM:
The DSC binaries and associated metadata reside in the , typically under:/System/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/dyld/

When XNU initializes the shared region, it installs page tables for the DSC segments in each process’s address space. On SPTM-enabled systems:Each PTE change for DSC pages is vetted by SPTM.The physical frames backing  are associated with a “immutable code” state; once mapped, they are not permitted to transition to writable mappings under EL1 control alone.Immutable Code under a Compromised Kernel:
Because SPTM operates at a higher privilege level than the kernel:Arbitrary EL1 writes cannot simply flip the DSC  pages to .Any attempt to create new executable mappings for code that has not been validated by TXM can be blocked by SPTM when the Execute bit is requested.Practically, this means traditional techniques that patch system libraries in-place from a kernel exploit are structurally constrained. Attackers must rely on indirection (e.g., hooks via , PLT-style trampolines, or userland injecting new, separately validated images) rather than overwriting shared-cache code directly.8.2.2  Code Signature Validation () and the Call to TXM is the primary enforcer of  for userland. The OS policy is:A process can only execute code that has been validated by the platform’s code-signing machinery, and for hardened processes, only from binaries signed by Apple or by the same Team ID as the main executable.When  loads a Mach-O image, either during initial process launch or via , the high-level flow is:
The file is mapped into the address space with appropriate protections (typically at least readable, but not yet executable).Signature Registration via : calls:struct fsignatures fs;
fcntl(fd, F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN, &fs);
The  structure informs the kernel where the code-signature blob (CMS) resides in the file and requests that this file be authorized for executable mappings.On older architectures, the kernel (plus AMFI) parsed and validated the CMS blob in EL1. On Tahoe systems, validation is mediated by TXM, and enforcement by SPTM.Conceptual Kernel → TXM Flow:
The kernel identifies the physical frames that contain:The Mach-O Code Directory.The CMS code-signature blob.Secure Monitor Invocation:
The kernel issues a secure call into TXM (e.g., via a -style transition), passing:References to those frames.Metadata for the code-signing request (team identifier, flags, platform binary vs third-party, etc.).
Inside TXM:The CMS blob is parsed and the signature chain is validated against:The  (for platform binaries shipped with the OS/Cryptexes), orApple’s CA hierarchy (for third-party code).Policy constraints are applied (e.g., hardened runtime flags, entitlements, revocation status).Verdict and SPTM Tagging:
TXM returns a verdict to the kernel. If the code is accepted:SPTM is updated with metadata that associates the relevant CDHash and physical frames with a “blessed for execution” state.Page-Fault-Time Enforcement:
When the process later executes into that image:The first access to a given code page triggers a page fault.The kernel attempts to install an executable PTE for that frame.SPTM intercepts the attempt and checks:Whether the frame was previously “blessed” by TXM for this CDHash.If the check fails, the mapping is refused and the process is terminated (e.g., with SIGKILL | Code Signature Invalid).The exact internal data structures and opcodes used between kernel, TXM, and SPTM are firmware implementation details. From the perspective of , the observable behaviour is that  can succeed or fail, and that executing unblessed code results in immediate termination, independent of kernel cooperation.
When a process dies immediately after  or after loading a plugin/framework, and  reports code-signature errors, the proximate userland symptom is often a failed fcntl(F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN) or an immediate crash on first execution into the library. The authoritative reason (revoked certificate, missing trust-cache entry, policy violation) lives in TXM/SPTM logs and kernel log events, which may be partially redacted on production builds.8.2.3 ASLR in Userland: Chained Fixups and the Death of Modern  (dyld 4.x and later) on Apple Silicon has effectively deprecated the legacy  rebasing/binding opcodes in favour of  (). This transition is not just a performance optimization; it is a fundamental change to how relocation metadata is encoded, tightly integrating ASLR and, on arm64e, PAC.Limitations of Legacy Rebasing:The previous model stored relocation metadata as a stream of opcodes (, ) that described where in  to add the ASLR slide and how to bind imports. At launch,  walked these opcode streams and:Touched every page that contained a relocatable pointer.Dirtying pages that might never be read, impacting both memory footprint and cache behaviour.Chained Fixups: On-Disk Representation:In the chained fixup model, on-disk “pointers” in the  segments are actually . For each image: points to a dyld_chained_fixups_header.This header references a dyld_chained_starts_in_image structure, which contains:Per-segment start tables (dyld_chained_starts_in_segment), andFor each participating segment, an array giving the offset of the first fixup in each 16 KiB page (or  if the page has none).At each fixup location, the file contains a 64-bit encoded value such as dyld_chained_ptr_64_rebase or :The  delta (in 4-byte units) to the next fixup in the same page.The  (either an offset into  for rebasing or an ordinal into the import table for binding).For arm64e, authentication flags and diversity bits.A  value of  terminates the chain for that page.Page-In Linking (Lazy Fixups):With chained fixups,  no longer performs a global sweep at launch:
The image is mapped into memory with its  and  segments, but most  pages have not yet been faulted in.First Access / Page Fault:
When the process first reads or writes through a pointer in  that resides on a page with chained fixups:A page fault is triggered.The kernel or a user-mode handler notes that this page has pending fixups.
The fixup logic:Consults the per-page start offset from dyld_chained_starts_in_image.Walks the chain by following  deltas until the chain terminates.
For each encoded “pointer”:The  is interpreted as:A  offset to be combined with the ASLR slide (for rebasing), orAn import ordinal resolved to a symbol address (for binding).On arm64e, the final pointer is authenticated:PAC( Base + Offset, Key, Context/Discriminator ) is computed using process-specific PAC keys.The 64-bit metadata word on the page is overwritten with the final, signed, slid pointer.
The page is now dirty (because the encoded metadata was overwritten), but only the pages that are actually accessed incur this cost.PAC Integration ():On arm64e, fixup entries use formats like  and DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_ARM64E_AUTH_*:Key selection (instruction/data key). computes PAC for each pointer at fixup time:The pointer is valid only under the current process’s PAC keys.Attempts to transplant the pointer into another process or mutate the context bits will cause PAC failures at use.ASLR and PAC are therefore coupled at the moment a page is faulted in and its fixups applied.Reverse-Engineering Implications:For reverse engineers, chained fixups fundamentally alter the static picture of binaries:Raw on-disk  segments no longer contain meaningful absolute pointers; they contain encoded metadata words.Naive disassembly or CFG reconstruction that ignores chained fixups will see “garbage” addresses and broken callgraphs.Correct analysis requires simulating ’s fixup engine to compute the final pointers.Parse  and the associated structs.Walk chains on a per-page basis.Optionally write a “de-chained” view of the file for analysis. and related tooling can emit a fixed-up view of Mach-O binaries extracted from DSCs.Apple’s  (and its open-source analogues) can extract and apply fixups to DSC residents.Recent versions of IDA Pro and Ghidra detect  and apply fixups within the analysis database, even though the on-disk file remains in its chained form.8.3 Cryptexes (Cryptographic Extensions)The introduction of the Signed System Volume (SSV) in macOS Big Sur solved the problem of persistence: by anchoring the root filesystem in a cryptographic hash verified by iBoot, Apple ensured that the core OS partition is immutable. However, this immutability created an operational problem: patching a single high-level component (for example,  or WebKit) would require resealing and redistributing the entire SSV.To resolve the tension between  and , Apple introduced  (Cryptographic Extensions). A Cryptex is a cryptographically sealed, versioned filesystem image that can be mounted and “grafted” into the system hierarchy at boot or runtime. In the Tahoe architecture, Cryptexes are the primary mechanism for the  design, decoupling the kernel/BSD and low-level system from rapidly evolving userland components.8.3.1 The “Split OS” Architecture: In modern macOS, the logical root filesystem () is effectively a skeleton:it contains the sealed snapshot of the kernel and core boot artifacts on the SSV, andit carries just enough structure to support bootstrapping.The bulk of high-level userland—, , system frameworks, many daemons—resides in the .A Cryptex is distributed as an :
A disk image (typically APFS) containing a filesystem hierarchy.
A signed metadata blob that binds the payload to Apple’s root keys. For some Cryptexes, the manifest can be  (tied to ECID, board, and security domain), preventing naive replay of mismatched OS components onto other devices.Cryptexes are not mounted via a user-visible  call. They are integrated into the system by early boot code and the APFS driver:
While iBoot verifies and loads the Boot Kernel Collection (which uses Cryptex architecture), the Userland “OS Cryptex” (containing dyld and frameworks) is typically located, verified, and mounted by the Kernel and Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) during the kernel bootstrapping phase, rather than directly by iBoot.
Inside the Cryptex, a binary trust cache (for example, ) lists CDHashes for all executable content in that Cryptex.
Before the filesystem is grafted, this trust cache is provided to TXM. TXM verifies its signature and, on success, merges the hashes into the platform’s Static Trust Cache for that boot.APFS grafting / firmlinks:
The APFS driver performs a graft operation that logically attaches the Cryptex under:and uses  or equivalent redirections so that paths like:/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/...
are transparently resolved into the OS Cryptex, even though the SSV copy of  and  is skeletal.From a reverse-engineering perspective, the “real” binaries of interest (current , system frameworks, many daemons) live under . Paths under  or  may be firmlinked views pointing back into this Cryptex.8.3.2 Rapid Security Response (RSR): Patching via Overlay CryptexesThe Cryptex mechanism enables Rapid Security Response (RSR): security updates that patch critical userland components residing in the OS Cryptex (e.g., WebKit, dyld) without requiring a full OS update or resealing of the SSV. Updating the kernel itself (Boot Kernel Collection) via RSR is architecturally constrained and typically requires a full OS update, as RSRs function as overlays on the userland filesystem.An RSR is delivered as an additional Cryptex:it usually contains only the components that changed (for example, updated dyld shared caches or WebKit frameworks),it ships with its own Image4 manifest and trust cache, validated similarly to the base OS Cryptex.
The  daemon orchestrates download, local verification, and placement of the new Cryptex image (typically onto the Preboot volume), and updates boot policy so early boot components know it exists.Verification and trust cache update:
During boot, the RSR Cryptex’s manifest is verified. Its embedded trust cache is ingested by TXM so that binaries from the RSR are eligible for execution.Overlaying the OS Cryptex:
The kernel overlays the RSR Cryptex on top of the base OS Cryptex using a union-style strategy:if a path exists in the RSR Cryptex, that version takes precedence;otherwise, the VFS falls back to the underlying base OS Cryptex content.The effective runtime view is:SSV  +  OS Cryptex  +  (optional) RSR Cryptex overlay
with VFS and firmlink logic ensuring a coherent  and  layout.Reversibility and Failure HandlingRSRs are designed to be reversible:
Boot policy ensures the system is either fully in “base OS” state or in “base OS + specific RSR overlay” state. Partial application is not supported.
If repeated boots under a given RSR Cryptex fail (for example, due to a regression), the boot chain can mark that RSR as inactive and revert to the base OS Cryptex on subsequent boots, without modifying the SSV.Security and RE Implications
Because Cryptexes and their trust caches are verified via Image4 and TXM, replaying older Cryptexes or RSRs is constrained by the same personalization and policy rules as the base OS.
RSRs live outside the SSV (typically on Preboot), but they remain in the verified boot chain via their manifests and trust caches.
To understand an RSR, you extract the RSR Cryptex image from the update payload, mount it, and diff its contents against the base OS Cryptex. The semantic delta is “what the RSR changed.” The live system view is the union of SSV + base OS Cryptex + any active RSR overlays, subject to SPTM/TXM integrity constraints.9.0 The Security Daemon HierarchyWhile the kernel and the hardware monitors (SPTM/TXM) enforce the immutable laws of the system physics (memory protections, page table integrity, executable mappings), the complex, mutable business logic of macOS security is delegated to a hierarchy of userland daemons. These daemons operate with high privileges, often holding special ports or entitlements that allow them to influence kernel policy. For the reverse engineer, these daemons represent the “Policy Engine” of the OS—and historically, the most fertile ground for logic bugs and sandbox escapes.9.1  (Apple Mobile File Integrity Daemon)The Apple Mobile File Integrity Daemon () is the userland arbiter of code execution policy. While the  enforces code-execution policy and manages trust caches for platform binaries in the guarded world, it lacks the context to evaluate the complex web of third-party provisioning profiles, developer certificates, notarization state, and MDM constraints.In the Tahoe architecture,  functions as the Policy Decision Point (PDP) for non-platform code, while the kernel and TXM act as the Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) that ultimately decide whether pages become executable.9.1.1 The Interaction between , the Kernel (MACF), and  does not poll for binaries; it is driven by the kernel via the Mandatory Access Control Framework (MACF) hooks in the AMFI/AppleMobileFileIntegrity path. is a critical system daemon launched by  early in the boot process. Because  is responsible for verifying signatures, it presents a bootstrap paradox:  is a platform binary shipped as part of the system OS (delivered via the Signed System Volume and associated cryptexes). Its  is included in the  that iBoot hands to the kernel during early boot. When  spawns , the kernel’s AMFI path consults TXM against the static trust cache. The CDHash is present, so the secure-world policy engine blesses the mapping immediately. No userland upcall is required for  itself.From this point onward,  becomes part of the trusted computing base: it is the userland process that encodes code-execution  for everything that is  already covered by immutable trust caches.The Verification Upcall (The “Slow Path”)When a user launches a third-party application (for example, /Applications/Calculator.app), the flow traverses the boundary between kernel and userland multiple times.The kernel executes . Along the AMFI path, the MACF hook mpo_vnode_check_signature in  is triggered. This hook is the choke point where the system decides whether the binary’s code signature is acceptable.The kernel (via AMFI) queries TXM in the guarded world (conceptually via an internal “GENTER”-style call). TXM consults the  and the .For a newly launched, third-party app whose CDHash has never been seen before, this lookup fails: there is no matching entry in either cache.On a trust-cache miss, the kernel must delegate policy to userland. It constructs a Mach message targeting the  (host special port 18), which is bound to .A send right to a  for the executable.Metadata describing offsets and sizes (location of the code signature blob, file length, etc.).The CDHash or code directory parameters needed for verification.Exact field layouts vary by OS release, but the kernel avoids trusting raw string paths where possible and instead relies on fileports and offsets. receives the MACH IPC and performs the heavy lifting:Parses the  / code signature blob from the file.Validates the certificate chain via  (Mobile Installation Service) and often IPC to .Extracts  and, if present, an embedded  ().Applies policy derived from Developer Mode, MDM profiles, and local configuration. responds to the kernel with a MIG reply corresponding to the  routine. For the kernel, this effectively collapses to:A status code (success, profile mismatch, expired certificate, etc.).Derived flags (e.g. whether  is permitted).Optionally, additional hints for AMFI.At this stage, the kernel updates the process’s  (Code Signing Flags), including bits such as  and , based on ’s verdict.If  approves the binary, the kernel performs a second secure-world interaction: the CDHash and relevant metadata are added to the  managed under TXM’s control. Future launches of the same, unchanged binary can now be satisfied entirely in TXM and AMFI without repeating the upcall. In Tahoe, the architecture is such that TXM remains the final authority on . Even if the kernel or  were compromised, adding a CDHash to the dynamic trust cache requires passing TXM’s guardrails.  supplies the  decision (“this developer identity / profile is acceptable here”), while TXM ensures that the code bytes actually match the identity being whitelisted.RE Focus: The MIG InterfaceThe communication interface is defined in the (reverse-engineered) MIG definition usually referred to as . The key routine is often named . for the caller (kernel), , offset and size parameters for the code signature, and flags controlling the verification mode. Historically, malformed Mach messages to ’s service port produced classic parsing bugs. Modern macOS hardens this by:
Validating the  to ensure calls originate from , not arbitrary userland.Tightening the MIG server and argument validation paths.Relying increasingly on fileports rather than untrusted string paths.For reverse engineers, the MIG stubs and their error-handling paths remain prime targets for logic bugs and subtle policy bypasses.9.1.2 Validating Code Directories (CDHash), Entitlements, and Provisioning ProfilesThe core logic of  resides in its ability to connect a binary’s  to a valid  and, when applicable, a . This mechanism enforces both the iOS-style “Walled Garden” and the macOS notarization regime.The Validation Logic (MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo) links against , which exports the symbol MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo. This function encapsulates most of the signature and profile evaluation: reads the  load command, locates the , and computes the  by hashing the slots specified by the Code Directory (typically a truncated SHA-256 or SHA-1, depending on platform and epoch).It parses the embedded entitlements plist from the signature blob. These entitlements express requested capabilities (e.g. com.apple.security.network.client, com.apple.security.get-task-allow, private IOKit entitlements).Profile Correlation (Developer-Signed Binaries)When the binary is signed by a non-Apple certificate:It looks for an embedded provisioning profile ().It verifies the  signature of the profile, ensuring it is issued by Apple.It compares the entitlements in the binary against the  dictionary in the profile, enforcing that the binary does not claim more than the profile grants.For development profiles, it verifies that the device’s identifier (UDID / platform identifier) is present in the  array (or matches the profile’s “All Devices” semantics, depending on platform). Certain entitlements (for example, com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox, low-level IOKit and CSR overrides) are “restricted” and only grantable when the signature chain terminates in specific Apple internal CAs or special program certificates. enforces this hierarchy by refusing binaries whose entitlements exceed what the provisioning profile and certificate chain permit.The “Union” of Trust: Notarization and GatekeeperOn macOS, this signature evaluation interacts with the  system, primarily implemented in :At download or first execution,  and  evaluate notarization tickets (stapled to the binary or stored under ) and decide whether the binary is admissible under current policy.Once a binary is admitted, subsequent executions still traverse AMFI/:
 ensures that the running code’s signature and entitlements still match what was originally notarized.It can treat notarized binaries as belonging to a higher trust tier compared to purely ad-hoc signatures (for example, relaxing some heuristics or additional scanning).The effective trust decision is thus the intersection of:Static trust caches and TXM policy (platform code).Gatekeeper / notarization (admission control for untrusted downloads). (per-execution verification and entitlement policy).RE Focus:  Reversing is heavily stripped and obfuscated, but it has a simple, observable contract:MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo returns an integer status, where  indicates success and non-zero error codes map to specific failures (profile expired, certificate invalid, entitlements mismatch, etc.). logs detailed failure reasons via  and friends. Many of these logs are visible only with specific boot arguments or developer configurations (for example, AMFI developer mode toggles).Instrumenting the call sites and enumerating non-zero return codes is often the most efficient way to understand why a given binary is being killed or stripped of capabilities.9.1.3 Exception Handling: How  and Debugging Entitlements are ProcessedOne of ’s most security-sensitive roles is gating access to process debugging. The ability to attach a debugger () is effectively a full compromise of the target process.The  EntitlementIn a standard production configuration, a process cannot be debugged unless either:The system is in a special developer or recovery mode, The target process possesses the com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement and other policy conditions are satisfied. When an app is built and run from Xcode, the build system signs it with a development certificate and injects , allowing / to obtain a task port. The App Store distribution pipeline strips  before submission; resulting binaries are non-debuggable under normal policy.During , the kernel extracts entitlements and passes them (directly or indirectly) into the AMFI/ path: validates that  appears in both:
The entitlements blob in the code signature.The entitlements and capabilities granted by the provisioning profile / certificate chain. indicates that  may be set in the process’s . Subsequent  checks can succeed (subject to further checks like caller UID, SIP bits, and TCC state).Invalid or Over-Privileged: can cause the entitlement to be ignored or the entire signature to be rejected, leading to kill-on-launch or a process without debug permissions.When  or  calls :The kernel checks the target’s  (including ) and applies additional policy (root privileges, SIP bits such as , and TCC automations).If the flags and policy allow it, the caller receives a send right to the target’s task port; otherwise, the call fails (e.g.  / ).Developer Mode (The Tahoe Shift)In the Tahoe architecture, the presence of  and a development certificate is no longer sufficient by itself. Debuggability is additionally gated by :Developer Mode state is maintained by  and enforced via SPTM/TXM. The AMFI/ path consults this state (via private interfaces and entitlements) when evaluating signatures.If Developer Mode is :Binaries signed solely with development certificates are generally treated as untrusted for execution and debugging on end-user systems.Even if the provisioning profile is otherwise valid,  and associated policy may refuse to honour , resulting in  that do not permit .This prevents the trivial side-loading of a “debuggable” app to inspect memory on a locked-down device; enabling Developer Mode requires an explicit, TXM-mediated ceremony that materially lowers the device’s security posture.Unrestricted Debugging, SIP, and AMFIOn macOS, System Integrity Protection (SIP) and  are distinct but interacting mechanisms: SIP is configured via  and boot arguments, setting bits such as  (relaxing debugging restrictions), CSR_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FS, and others.AMFI / : On internal or development builds, AMFI can be disabled or relaxed via boot-args (e.g. ), effectively causing the kernel to bypass code-signing enforcement.Setting debug CSR bits like  allowed broader debugging of system processes, but  by itself disable AMFI’s signature checks.Disabling AMFI () is what effectively causes the kernel to treat code signatures as trivially acceptable.SIP state is one of the inputs into , with TXM enforcing the resulting policy at the page-table and executable-mapping level.AMFI and  still perform signature and entitlement checks, but some CSR bits continue to relax specific restrictions (for example, attaching a debugger to processes that would otherwise be non-debuggable).Fully “everything is valid” behaviour is reserved for tightly controlled developer or internal configurations and is not reachable on production systems without both SIP and AMFI being simultaneously subverted.9.2  & The Seatbelt PolicyIf  is the bouncer checking identities at the door, the  subsystem (marketed as App Sandbox) is the straightjacket applied once code is inside. Originating from TrustedBSD, the macOS sandbox is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanism that restricts a process’s access to resources—files, sockets, Mach ports, IOKit drivers—regardless of the user’s UID.In the Tahoe architecture, the sandbox has evolved from a predominantly path-based filter into a semantic, metadata-driven enforcement layer, tightly coupled with the kernel’s VFS and process credential machinery and integrated with new  primitives.Sandbox profiles are expressed in SBPL (Sandbox Policy Language), a Scheme-like (LISP) dialect. The kernel does  interpret SBPL directly. Instead, policy is compiled into a compact bytecode format that the kernel executes.The SBPL compiler lives primarily in  (and its libsystem glue), not in .Depending on the process, different profiles are selected: The system applies a generic  profile that implements the standard app sandbox. Daemons specify their profile name in their  (for example, ), which is resolved to an SBPL specification. In modern macOS, many core policies are consolidated into a  bundled with  / the Boot Kernel Collection. Individual SBPL files for system services still exist, but the trend is toward more policy being pre-compiled into the kernel cache to reduce runtime parsing and external configuration surface.The Compiler ( / )When a process initializes the sandbox (for example, via sandbox_init_with_parameters):The call enters  in the process address space. parses the SBPL (often using an embedded TinyScheme derivative).It resolves variable expansions such as , , and environment-dependent paths.It compiles the SBPL rules into a proprietary  representation. is not on this critical path. Its primary role is to receive violation reports and log denied operations; it is not the SBPL compiler.The compiled blob is a serialized decision machine: Operations such as “match path”, “match pattern”, “check entitlement”, “allow”, “deny”, and conditional branching. Rules are arranged into decision trees or tries keyed by operation class and path prefix (for example, file operations grouped under , ).This bytecode is opaque to userland: it is handed to the kernel via the  / sandbox-specific syscalls, where  attaches it to the process’s MAC label.RE Focus: Reversing the Binary BlobThe kernel receives the compiled profile via a MACF-specific syscall (e.g.  with ): The blob can be captured by:
Hooking  /  inside .Hooking  /  at the userland boundary.Extracting the label attached to the process in the kernel ( → sandbox label). Tools such as  (Sandbox Scrutinizer) or custom disassemblers lift the bytecode back into an SBPL-like intermediate representation. In Tahoe, the kernel performs sanity checks on the bytecode (bounds checks, instruction validity, loop constraints) before attaching it to a process. This reduces the risk that a malformed profile can hang or crash kernel threads.9.2.2 The Sandbox Kernel Extension: Hooking Syscalls via the MAC FrameworkThe enforcement engine is , which hooks into the XNU kernel via the Mandatory Access Control Framework (MACF).XNU is instrumented with a large set of  hooks placed at security-critical bottlenecks:, , , etc., mac_mach_port_check_receive., mac_iokit_check_get_property. registers a  via a  structure whose function pointers implement these hooks.A sandboxed process issues a syscall, for example:open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);The kernel executes . MACF dispatches this call to all registered policies, including .Looks up the process’s .Retrieves the , which includes a pointer to the compiled profile bytecode.Normalizes arguments (operation kind, path, vnode type, etc.) into a canonical form.The sandbox engine executes the profile bytecode: Operation (for example, ), resource (path ), additional attributes (file type, vnode flags). Traverses the pre-compiled decision tree, checking path prefixes, patterns, and entitlements.Caching (Performance Critical Path)Evaluating bytecode on every syscall would be prohibitively expensive, so  maintains caches:Per-vnode caches: Attach allow/deny decisions to vnode labels once a decision has been made.Per-process caches: Cache repeated deny decisions for patterns known to be disallowed.Subsequent accesses to the same file or resource often bypass the full bytecode interpreter and reuse cached verdicts. Bugs in cache invalidation (for example, renames, mount points, or attribute changes that fail to invalidate cached decisions) can lead to enforcement bypasses where the sandbox decision no longer reflects reality.The Tahoe / SPTM IntersectionWhile sandbox policy is defined in software, the integrity of the enforcement hooks is backed by hardware:The  structures and many related function pointer tables reside in  segments (/) in the Boot Kernel Collection. enforce invariants on the kernel’s page tables, preventing EL1 code from remapping those const segments as writable, even under a kernel write primitive.This has two consequences:Classical rootkits that “unhook” sandbox enforcement by overwriting function pointers in  are blocked at the page-table level: the attempted store either faults or writes to a non-effective alias.The sandbox policy can still be subverted through more subtle means (policy loading, profile compilation, credential forgery), but transparent pointer overwrites of core hooks are no longer a viable attack on Tahoe-class hardware.9.2.3 Containerization: Data Vaults and Group ContainersIn the Tahoe era, Apple has moved beyond simple path-based rules (fragile and prone to symlink and mountpoint attacks) toward semantic containerization of data.Data Vaults are used to protect the most sensitive data at rest—for example, Messages, Photos, and certain system databases. A Data Vault is typically a directory or volume flagged with specific VFS attributes (for example, the “datavault” flag and associated extended attributes).Access decisions are made in MAC hooks  classic Discretionary Access Control (DAC). Even  (UID 0) cannot trivially  or  a Data Vault.Access is granted only if the calling process holds specific, private entitlements (for example, com.apple.private.security.storage.AppDataVault or service-specific variants). Running as  with  is no longer sufficient. Data Vault checks are keyed off entitlements and sandbox state, not UID. Kernel symbols such as rootless_check_datavault_flag and related helpers encode these checks. Reversing them reveals:How Data Vault flags are stored in the vnode and mount structures.Which entitlements are accepted for a given vault class.To support IPC and data sharing between apps and their extensions (for example, a Widget and its host app), the sandbox introduces .The  Entitlement: Declares group IDs such as . These IDs define shared container namespaces. The system daemon  manages the lifecycle and filesystem layout of these group directories (typically under ~/Library/Group Containers/).When compiling the app’s sandbox profile,  inspects entitlements.For each  identifier, it injects rules that allow controlled read/write access to ${HOME}/Library/Group Containers/<group-id>.This binds filesystem access directly to the cryptographic identity of the executable: only code signed with a matching App Group entitlement can enter that directory.For the reverse engineer, group containers provide a clear mapping from entitlements → filesystem layout; group container IDs found in entitlements can be used to locate shared state and attack surfaces.9.3  (Transparency, Consent, and Control)If  validates code identity and /Seatbelt constrain code reach,  governs the most volatile part of the security model: .The Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) subsystem is effectively a “User Intent Oracle”. It governs access to privacy-sensitive sensors (Camera, Microphone), personal data (Contacts, Calendars, Photos), and privileged capabilities (Full Disk Access, Screen Recording). In the Tahoe architecture,  has evolved from a simple “prompt and remember” component into a complex attribution engine that must defend against consent hijacking and attribution spoofing.9.3.1 The TCC Database: Schema, Integrity, and SIPTCC persists user consent state in SQLite databases. There is a split between system-wide and per-user state:/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db — root-owned, stores system-wide decisions such as Full Disk Access.~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db — user-owned, stores per-user decisions such as Camera/Microphone access.The core table is . For reverse engineering, key columns include: Identifies the privilege (e.g. kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles, , ). The bundle identifier or absolute path of the client. Indicates whether  is interpreted as a bundle ID () or path (). Encodes the decision (e.g.  = Denied,  = Unknown / Prompt,  = Allowed,  = Limited). A compiled Code Signing Requirement (CSReq) used to bind the decision to a particular identity, not just a path string.Additional columns (timestamps, indirect attribution fields, categories) vary by OS release, but these fields form the stable core.The  Blob: Cryptographic AnchorTCC does  trust filesystem paths alone. Instead:When a request arrives,  obtains the process’s code signing information (via  or similar APIs).It evaluates whether the  satisfies the stored  expression from the database row:(Current_Code_Signature) satisfies (Stored_CSReq)
If the check fails (for example, the app was re-signed with a different certificate), existing permissions do not apply, and a new prompt may be triggered or access denied.This prevents an attacker from overwriting /Applications/TrustedApp.app with malware and inheriting its camera or disk permissions.Although the TCC databases are ordinary SQLite files, access to them is tightly controlled: The system TCC database is protected by SIP; direct modifications are blocked for all but a handful of Apple-signed components with special entitlements (including  itself). On newer macOS versions, the directory containing TCC databases can be part of a , requiring specific entitlements just to traverse or open the directory and files.Exclusive Control by : maintains long-lived connections and can hold locks on the database.Attempts to modify the file on disk directly (for example, via  under a disabled SIP configuration) often lead to integrity check failures, after which  may restore the database from a backup or recover via WAL semantics.RE Focus: The  FallacyThe  command-line utility behaves as a client of TCC, not a raw database editor:It communicates with  via XPC to request resets or clears.It does not write to  directly.Observing XPC traffic between  and  yields the supported operations and their internal names.Direct tampering with  is fragile and often counterproductive; intercepting or simulating ’s own XPC interfaces is more robust.9.3.2 The Attribution Chain: Determining  Is AskingThe hardest problem TCC solves is . When an action flows through multiple processes, which one should be considered the “client” for consent purposes?A GUI app that launches a helper tool to touch the camera.A terminal running a shell script that launches  or a Python interpreter.A background agent performing work on behalf of a signed, user-facing app.When a message arrives at  (for example, over  or ):The Mach message carries an  in its trailer. extracts PID, UID, GID, and audit attributes from this token.It uses the kernel’s code-signing interfaces (,  flags) to resolve the token to an actual, signed binary on disk.The audit token is provided by the kernel and cannot be forged by userland, making it the primary identity anchor.The “Responsible Process” ProblemAttribution is not always identical to the immediate caller:For  running , the  entity for a network or disk access may be considered , not .For automation or helper tools, a background daemon might act on behalf of a user-facing app.To handle this, TCC models an : and Relationship TrackingLaunch services, XPC, and higher-level frameworks can mark another process as the “responsible” one (for example, via launch configuration or XPC flags). verifies that the relationship between caller and responsible process is legitimate (parent–child, session, or entitlement-based).Access Object ConstructionInternally,  constructs a conceptual : The process issuing the request (the immediate caller). The process that will actually interact with the resource (often equal to the subject). The process that should be presented to the user in UI and used as the key in the database.If the caller has a private entitlement such as com.apple.private.tcc.allow for the requested service, access is granted without user interaction.Otherwise, TCC looks for an existing row in  for the attributor and service (using  matching).If no row exists,  triggers a user prompt.TCC prompts are not drawn by the requesting client: delegates UI to system agents such as  / .Prompts are shown in elevated WindowServer layers that the client cannot fully control or overlay, mitigating clickjacking and fake consent dialogs.9.3.3 RE Focus: XPC Attacks against TCC Endpoint ValidationFrom a vulnerability research perspective,  is a high-value target. Gaining the ability to impersonate a trusted client (such as ) can yield Full Disk Access or other sensitive capabilities.Attack Vector 1: XPC Injection into Trusted ClientsMany TCC-permitted apps are extensible:They load bundles or plugins via .They may allow scripting or untrusted content with code execution.If an attacker injects code into such a process:That code runs  the trusted PID.TCC continues to see the trusted app’s identity and grants access based on its existing permissions. and  (enforced by AMFI and  in cooperation with TXM) prevent loading unsigned or unentitled libraries into hardened processes.However, any app with com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation or similar entitlements remains a potential carrier for this class of attack.Attack Vector 2: Fake Attributors and XPC Payload SpoofingEarlier macOS versions were more trusting of client-supplied metadata in XPC messages:Some TCC code paths accepted an explicit “target token” or attribution fields from the client’s XPC dictionary.Attackers could attempt to supply a forged  that pointed to a more privileged app.Modern TCC has hardened this:For most services,  ignores user-provided tokens in XPC payloads.It trusts only the kernel-supplied audit token from the Mach message trailer and reconstructs attribution from kernel state and entitlement checks.Attack Vector 3: Semantic Confusion via Automation (AppleEvents, , etc.)An attacker can attempt to coerce a privileged app into performing an action:For example, using AppleEvents or the  command to cause  or another privileged app to run a script or open a sensitive file.If the privileged app is the attributor in TCC’s view, its permissions are leveraged by the attacker’s payload. such as  gate which apps can send AppleEvents to which targets. tracks automation relationships and often requires separate consent for one app to control another.The Tahoe Impact: Hardware-Anchored IdentityOn Apple Silicon with Tahoe-class hardware:TCC depends on code-signing identity and hardened runtime flags obtained from the kernel.Those, in turn, are anchored in TXM and SPTM:TXM controls executable mappings and trust caches.SPTM enforces that the kernel’s view of code identity cannot be arbitrarily rewritten via page-table manipulation.A kernel attacker who sets  bits in process credentials without correspondingly convincing TXM risks creating a state where pages will not be executable or are killed on use.TCC’s reliance on code identity is therefore backed by a hardware root of trust: subtly altering TCC decisions still requires either:Subverting ’s logic (via XPC or parsing bugs), orSubverting the TXM/SPTM path that defines which CDHashes are trustworthy.Even under kernel compromise, forging the identity of a high-value system binary that TCC trusts is significantly more complex than on pre-SPTM systems; the identity must be consistent from the userland view, the kernel’s credentials, and the secure-world trust caches.10.0 User Session, Authentication & Data ProtectionThe transition from the system bootstrap phase to the interactive user session represents a critical boundary crossing. Up to this point, the system has operated primarily in the  domain, managed by the root  context. The instantiation of a user session requires the creation of a new security context—the —and the decryption of user-specific cryptographic material anchored in the Secure Enclave.In the Tahoe architecture, this process is no longer a simple comparison of a password hash against a file. It is a hardware-mediated ceremony involving:Evaluation of the user’s credentials via  and the  store.Unlocking of a SEP-protected per-user secret that underpins the  / FileVault authorization model.Derivation or unwrapping of the  inside the SEP.Establishment of a local Kerberos identity (via the Local KDC / LKDC) for those services that participate in single sign-on, with the initial credentials ultimately rooted in secrets that are only accessible after the SEP has accepted the login.Biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID, Optic ID) do not replace the password; they conditionally authorize the Secure Enclave to perform cryptographic operations—such as unwrapping key material—that would otherwise require manual secret entry.10.1  & The graphical login experience is orchestrated by two primary userland components: – Manages the session lifecycle and login UI, coordinates shield windows, and drives the state machine for login / logout / fast user switching. – Provides the abstraction layer for authentication and identity services, loading plugins to speak to local, LDAP, and Active Directory nodes.Both components have lineage back to NeXTSTEP, but their internals have been aggressively refactored to support the hardware-backed security model of Apple Silicon and the Tahoe boot chain.10.1.1 The Audit Session ID (ASID) and Kernel TrackingIn XNU, the concept of a “User” in the sense of a  is tracked via the . This is distinct from the UNIX UID/GID: – Identify principals in the traditional POSIX sense. – Identifies a specific authenticated session (e.g. physical console login, fast user switch slot, SSH login, screen sharing session).Every process in the system carries an  which encodes, among other fields, the ASID of the session under which it is running.When  successfully authenticates a user, it does not simply . It calls into the BSM audit stack via the  syscall (typically through  wrappers): The syscall populates the  state, from which  values are derived for that process. Children inherit their parent’s ASID in much the same way they inherit UID/GID. Changing an ASID after it has been established is tightly controlled. In practice, only a small set of privileged components (e.g. , ) can create or reassign audit sessions, and they do so under private entitlements discovered via reverse engineering rather than public API.For almost all processes, the ASID behaves as a write-once attribute: it is set when the session is created and then propagated down the process tree.ASID as a Console Ownership signalThe ASID acts as a primary signal for “Console Ownership” in several subsystems:
Access-control decisions for sensors such as Camera and Microphone are made in the context of an audit token. When a process requests, for example, Camera access,  evaluates whether the request comes from the ASID associated with the active graphical console. Foreground sessions see prompts; non-console sessions (e.g. SSH) are generally denied or handled differently.
Only processes that belong to the active console ASID are permitted to establish the full, interactive connection to the WindowServer required to draw on the screen. Other ASIDs may be confined to offscreen rendering, remote sessions, or be blocked entirely.This makes the ASID a crucial anchor for reasoning about which processes are “actually in front of the user” in the Tahoe user-session model.RE Focus:  and launchd domainsHistorically, the transition from the  context (running as root) to the user context involved a setuid helper binary, , which mediated the handoff of credentials and environment to a per-user  process. That design existed in earlier OS X releases.Modern macOS (including Tahoe) uses a hierarchical model:There is a system  process (PID 1) for the entire system.Additionally, modern macOS spawns separate, per-user  processes to manage user-specific sessions and agents. manages multiple  in its bootstrap namespace:A  for LaunchDaemons. keyed by UID (e.g. ). keyed by ASID (e.g.  or ).GUI domains (e.g. ) that correspond to interactive consoles.On successful authentication,  now:Uses private XPC/session APIs (e.g.  and related calls, as observed via reverse engineering) to facilitate the creation of a  which manages:A  for the authenticated UID.A  keyed by the newly established ASID.Binds that login domain to the new Audit Session:New user processes launched for the session are started under this per-user .Their  values reflect both the user’s UID and the new ASID.The  becomes the  of the user’s process tree for that session (services, agents, apps).While ultimately bootstrapped by the system, these processes are managed by the distinct per-user  entity rather than existing solely as domains inside the global PID 1 .For reverse engineers, the key observation points are:Tracking how  transitions from “no session” to “new ASID + new login domain”.Enumerating  jobs in the relevant  and  namespaces to reconstruct the user’s process lattice for a given ASID.10.1.2 : The Shield Window and Session State (at /System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/MacOS/loginwindow) is the session leader for the console. It:Draws the login UI and lock screen.Negotiates authentication with  and Kerberos components.Manages fast user switching and logout.Maintains the “Shield Window” that sits above all userland UI during sensitive phases.The Shield Window (anti-overlay)To prevent “fake login” and clickjacking attacks in which a malicious application draws a visually perfect imitation of the login screen to steal credentials,  uses a privileged connection to  (the WindowServer framework): The login UI is drawn at or near , a reserved Z-order used by the system for modalities like login, lock, and screen dimming overlays. While the Shield Window is active, the WindowServer routes all keyboard and pointer events exclusively to . Background applications may still be composited but do not receive input, even if their windows visually overlap or mimic the login UI. The Shield Window is tied to the active console ASID, so remote or background sessions cannot legitimately persist a shield that captures events intended for the physical user.For RE work, confirming input exclusivity via event taps is a good sanity check that the shielded state is active. implements a substantial state machine driven by: Legacy IPC paths that still orchestrate parts of the login / logout choreography and client notifications.Darwin Notifications / XPC: Modern notification mechanisms for coordinating with , , and system services.
While officially deprecated, the underlying code paths remain. They are surrounded by modern sandboxing and hardened runtime checks, but they still provide observable transitions around session start / end.Session state persistence:Resume / Transparent App Lifecycle (TAL): participates in the “Resume” feature (re-opening windows after reboot or logout). State is persisted across:Per-host preferences such as ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*.plist.Per-application saved state under ~/Library/Saved Application State/.These artifacts are protected by the user’s Data Protection keys and provide a rich post-mortem surface for reconstructing session evolution.10.1.3 : The Authentication Broker is the daemon responsible for answering the question: “Are these credentials valid for this identity?” It is a modular daemon that loads plugins (bundles) to handle different directory services: local, LDAP, Active Directory, and more.The Local Node ()On a standalone Mac, authentication is handled by the , whose data store lives under:/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/ are stored as individual property list () files under .These plists contain metadata (name, UID, group memberships, secure token flags, etc.) but not directly the password hash.The actual password verifier is stored as  data:The user plist typically contains a  key whose value is a binary blob.Analysis of these blobs shows:A  representation of the password for compatibility with older flows and offline verification scenarios.Additional structured fields used by Apple’s modern authentication path, including material that is only meaningful in combination with the Secure Enclave and device-specific secrets.In the Tahoe-era architecture, it is useful to conceptually treat part of this blob as a SEP-wrapped per-user secret that participates in FileVault and keybag unlock. Apple does not publish the internal structure of , but reverse engineering strongly indicates that the blob contains more than a conventional hash.Verification Flow ()When  submits a password to  for a local account, the flow roughly looks like this: uses its Local Node plugin to locate the user record and retrieve the associated  blob.
The SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2 component can be verified locally to confidently reject obviously wrong passwords without involving the SEP.Secure Enclave mediation:
For FileVault-enabled accounts and for modern secure-token flows,  (via lower layers in the stack) invokes the  interface in the kernel:The candidate password and the relevant wrapped secret(s) derived from  are marshalled to the kernel.The kernel forwards this to the SEP over the mailbox channel.The device’s  (fused in hardware, never leaving the SEP).A KDF over the password and salt.Policy- and measurement-dependent state (e.g. SKP).The SEP attempts to “unwrap” the per-user secret and, if successful, signals success and may derive additional keys for keybag and FileVault operations. treats SEP success as authoritative for those modern flows. A failure at this stage typically manifests as an authentication error even if the legacy PBKDF2 hash alone would have been satisfied.This architecture has two important consequences:Password hashes vs. device-bound keys:
Extracting  allows offline cracking of the PBKDF2-SHA512 password hash, but recovering the password does  by itself reconstruct the FileVault Volume Encryption Key (VEK) or class keys. Those require the SEP, UID key, and SKP-bound material.
The secrets that actually unlock user data are bound to the specific Secure Enclave instance that created them. Moving Shadow Hash material to another Mac does not make that user’s FileVault-protected data decryptable without further compromise.From a red-team perspective, this forces attacks toward live credential interception (before the password is sent into the verification pipeline) or SEP compromise, rather than traditional offline hash cracking for disk decryption.10.1.4 Kerberos and the Local KDC (Heimdal)Modern macOS systems ship with a  stack and, by default, support a Local Key Distribution Center (LKDC). The LKDC provides Kerberized identities for local services and is integrated with Open Directory.Why Kerberos on a standalone Mac?Kerberos avoids passing plaintext passwords around systemwide. Instead:Initial login (when Kerberos is configured):
Once the user’s credentials have been accepted (potentially via SEP-mediated verification), the system can obtain a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from the LKDC corresponding to that account. This step is conditional: non-Kerberized setups or purely local workflows may omit it.
Kerberos tickets are stored in a credential cache managed by the system (kernel and userland helpers), typically accessed via the standard  / CCAPI plumbing.
When the user interacts with Kerberized services (e.g. Screen Sharing, some system preference panes, local file services, AD-backed services), the client obtains a  from the LKDC and presents it to the target service instead of resending the password.
Services validate the Kerberos ticket and enforce their own authorization logic.In higher-assurance environments:Smart cards or platform PIV tokens (backed by the Secure Enclave) are used instead of passwords.Kerberos uses  to validate an X.509 certificate chain, mapping it to a Kerberos principal.Tahoe’s hardened boot and driver model ensures that:The smart card driver stack (often running as a driver extension, ) is validated and measured under TXM/LocalPolicy.Certificates and private keys used for PKINIT are only accessible after SEP policy checks.RE Focus: The private  contains the glue between , , and the Kerberos stack:Functions like krb5_get_init_creds_password remain useful RE chokepoints for observing when and how plaintext credentials are turned into Kerberos tickets.Hooking these paths requires bypassing SIP and the hardened runtime and is therefore squarely in the “post-exploitation / lab” category rather than a practical on-disk modification target.10.2 Biometric Unlock (Touch ID / Face ID / Optic ID)Biometric authentication on Apple platforms is frequently misunderstood as a replacement for the passcode or password. Architecturally, it is a :Biometrics never replace the underlying secret; they authorize the Secure Enclave to perform a cryptographic operation that would otherwise require manual entry of that secret.The SEP decides whether biometric factors are currently acceptable (policy, backoff, recent passcode use, secure intent).On success, the SEP unlocks or derives specific keys and returns opaque handles or tokens to the OS.In the Tahoe architecture, the biometric stack is an interplay between:Userland daemons (, ).Kernel drivers (, Local Authentication hooks).For Face ID and Optic ID: the Secure Neural Engine (SNE).10.2.1 The Daemon Hierarchy:  →  → SEPThe implementation is split across two main daemons to enforce separation of concerns:
Located at/System/Library/Frameworks/LocalAuthentication.framework/Support/coreauthd,
it implements the system’s Local Authentication policy engine:Manages  instances and associates them with PIDs, ASIDs, and calling processes.Parses Keychain Access Control Lists (ACLs), evaluating requirements such as “biometry OR passcode” vs “biometry AND device unlock”.Implements the Access Control Module (ACM) logic that mirrors SEP-side decision structures: it constructs and validates the requests that will eventually be sent to the Secure Enclave.
Located at /usr/libexec/biometrickitd, it manages the physical biometric sensors: Loads device-specific plugins (e.g. Mesa for Touch ID, Pearl for Face ID, Jade for Optic ID).Power / state management: Controls sensor power, exposure, illumination hardware, and readiness. Sets up shared buffers or DMA configurations between the sensor hardware and the Secure Enclave via the kernel. It does not perform high-level biometric matching; it shuttles encrypted sensor output toward the SEP.A typical biometric request flows as follows:An app invokes -[LAContext evaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply:].Validates the caller’s code signature, entitlements, and audit token (including ASID).Checks Keychain or system ACLs to decide whether biometry is acceptable for this operation.Creates an  structure representing this auth attempt. sends an XPC request to  to  the appropriate sensor.Issues  requests into the biometric kernel driver ( and relatives).The driver configures the sensor and a buffer that is shared with or visible to the Secure Enclave.The kernel signals the SEP via the mailbox that a biometric capture session is ready and provides the buffer references.At that point, the SEP takes over capture, matching, and decision logic; userland daemons observe state transitions and present UI, but never see raw biometric templates.10.2.2 The Hardware Path: Sensor-to-SEP PairingA critical security property of the biometric stack is  between the sensor module and the Secure Enclave.During manufacturing and repair-authorization procedures:The biometric sensor module (Touch ID button, TrueDepth camera system, Optic ID array) and the SEP perform a pairing protocol.A shared secret is established and stored:In the sensor’s controller.In SEP-managed internal storage (e.g. xART).When a biometric capture occurs:The sensor acquires raw data (fingerprint ridge map, IR depth map, iris texture).The sensor hardware encrypts this data using an ephemeral session key—negotiated via the shared pairing secret—before putting it on the bus.The encrypted payload travels over SPI/MIPI to the Application Processor.The biometric kernel driver writes the encrypted blob into a region of memory that is readable by the SEP.The SEP reads the blob, decrypts it using the session key, and performs all further processing internally.From the AP’s perspective, these buffers contain high-entropy ciphertext. Dumping them from the kernel or an I/O trace yields no usable biometric image data.Two empirically observable consequences:Swapping a Touch ID or Face ID module between devices without running Apple’s pairing tools causes biometric functions to fail: the SEP can no longer decrypt sensor output.Hooking the biometric driver stack and dumping in-flight data shows encrypted blobs rather than structured images, confirming that matching happens exclusively inside the SEP / SNE domain.10.2.3 The Secure Neural Engine (SNE) & Optic IDFace ID and Optic ID push biometric matching beyond the capabilities of the general-purpose SEP core. To handle these workloads, Apple partitions the  into:A  – accessible to userland via Core ML.A  – a slice reserved for the Secure Enclave, sometimes referred to as the Secure Neural Engine (SNE).Optic ID Flow (Tahoe / Vision Pro)At a high level, an Optic ID authentication proceeds as follows:
The dedicated Optic ID cameras capture spatiotemporally modulated IR images of the user’s eyes.
As with Touch ID and Face ID, the raw frames are encrypted at the sensor and written as ciphertext into memory visible to the SEP.Ensures that the portion of the Neural Engine allocated for secure use is scrubbed and placed under the control of its memory protection regime.Loads the Optic ID neural network model and associated parameters.
The SEP feeds the encrypted image data through the secure ANE slice:The SNE produces feature vectors representing the iris and surrounding structures.
The SEP compares the feature vector against stored templates in its  (xART-backed), applying thresholds, quality checks, and policy (user presence, recent activity, etc.).Liveness and Attention detection:
In parallel, the SEP uses the spatiotemporal pattern of IR illumination and pupil response to distinguish live tissue from static imagery or contact-lens attacks. In addition to spatiotemporal patterns, the SEP utilizes "Attention Aware" neural networks to verify gaze direction and eye openness, ensuring the user is alert and consenting.On recent Apple Silicon generations:The memory used for SEP-private and SEP–SNE-shared computations is protected by the Secure Enclave’s .Observers outside the SEP domain (including the AP and hypervisors) see encrypted and authenticated data when they attempt to read those regions.Biometric templates and intermediate neural activations never appear in plaintext outside the Secure Enclave trust boundary.Dumping DRAM does not expose Optic ID templates or models in a directly usable form.10.2.4 Secure Intent: The GPIO HardlineFor high-value transactions (Apple Pay, high-assurance key operations), Apple requires more than “biometric match.” Malware could, in principle, trick the user into satisfying a biometric prompt while a hidden transaction is in flight.To address this, Apple implements  as a physical side channel into the SEP.The side/top/power button is wired not only to the Application Processor and Always-On Processor (AOP), but also via a dedicated signal path to the Secure Enclave.This signal path allows the SEP to independently observe specific button gestures (e.g. double-click).When a transaction is marked as requiring secure intent (via LocalAuthentication / Apple Pay policy):The SEP performs the biometric match as usual.On success, instead of immediately unwrapping or signing with the relevant key, the SEP:Records that a biometric match is pending for a secure-intent operation.Starts a short internal timer window.The SEP monitors its dedicated button line for the required gesture (e.g. double-click within a given time bound).Only if both conditions are satisfied:Recent acceptable biometric match.Correct physical button gesture within the window.
does the SEP:Release the Apple Pay token.Unwrap or use the key required for the operation.From an attacker’s perspective:UI spoofing (e.g. drawing a fake “Double Click to Pay” overlay via ) cannot produce the electrical signal on the SEP’s dedicated line.Even full compromise of the AP and WindowServer stack cannot bypass secure intent without either:Inducing the user to perform the real physical gesture at the right time, orCompromising the SEP itself.10.2.5 The Local Authentication Context (LAC) and Token BindingWhen authentication succeeds, the SEP does not simply return  / . It returns or maintains  that is later used to authorize specific operations.Internally,  and related components track an opaque handle (often modeled as an ) associated with:The LAContext created for the app.The factor that succeeded (passcode vs. biometry).Relevant policy state (device lock state, secure intent, etc.).This handle is then passed to other system components that need to prove “recent successful user presence” without re-prompting.Keychain and token bindingFor a Keychain item protected by kSecAccessControlUserPresence or a similar policy:The client invokes a Keychain operation. (the Keychain daemon) verifies that it has a suitable  or triggers  to obtain one.The encrypted keyblob (wrapped key).The  or equivalent context.
to the SEP.The handle is checked for validity and freshness (time bounds, lock state, backoff).If valid, the SEP uses its internal keys to unwrap the keyblob.Depending on the item’s protection:The unwrapped key may be returned to  (for extractable keys).Or the SEP may perform the cryptographic operation internally (for non-extractable keys).In all cases, the AP never gains the ability to “forge” recent user presence; it can only present handles that the SEP previously issued.The SEP enforces retry and lockout policy in hardware:Failed biometric attempts increment counters stored in SEP-protected storage (e.g. xART).After a small number of failures, delays are introduced between attempts.After a bounded number of failures (e.g. five for Face ID / Touch ID), biometric authentication is disabled until the user enters the passcode or password.Time-based rules (such as requiring a passcode after a certain period since last unlock or since last passcode entry) are also enforced by SEP logic rather than the AP.The exact thresholds and timing are encoded in  and evolve across OS generations, but the important property is that they are  under kernel or userland control.10.3 Data Protection & FileVaultOn Intel Macs, FileVault was implemented as a distinct full-disk encryption layer (CoreStorage) that sat below the filesystem. On Apple Silicon, this layering has collapsed into a unified  model:Every file on the APFS volume is encrypted with a per-file key.Per-file keys are wrapped by .Class keys are stored in  that are managed by the Secure Enclave.“Turning on FileVault” primarily changes how the Volume Encryption Key (VEK) is protected: from “effectively UID-only” to “UID plus user secret (password) and system measurement (SKP).”In macOS Tahoe, the Data Protection model from iOS is carried over almost verbatim and extended with Mac-specific SKP and policy machinery.10.3.1 Unwrapping the User Keybag: The Class Key HierarchyThe central on-disk structure for Data Protection is the :A binary property list stored in system-managed locations (paths vary with OS releases and boot volume layout).Contains  and metadata.Is always consumed by the SEP; the kernel never sees cleartext class keys.
A device-unique AES key, fused into the Secure Enclave and never exposed outside it.User password / passcode:
The logical secret known to the user and entered at login or unlock time.Passcode-derived key (PDK):
The SEP mixes:A KDF over the password plus salt (PBKDF2-like).Policy-dependent inputs (e.g. SKP measurement).
Conceptually:PDK = Tangle( UID, PBKDF2(password, salt), measurement, policy )
The exact KDF and tangling function are implementation details, but the key property is: PDK cannot be derived off-device.
The keybag stores wrapped class keys corresponding to the Data Protection classes:Class A (“Complete Protection”):
Data only accessible while the device is unlocked. Keys are evicted from SEP memory when the device locks.Class B (“Protected Unless Open”):
Similar to Class A, but open file handles may retain ephemeral context to allow certain operations to complete in the background.Class C (“Protected Until First User Authentication” / “First Unlock”):
Keys are brought into SEP memory after the first successful unlock and persist (subject to policy) until reboot. FileVault’s VEK is conceptually associated with this class on Apple Silicon Macs.Class D (“No User Secret” / “UID-only”):
Keys wrapped solely by the UID (and SKP where applicable). Used for data that must be accessible before user login (e.g. some system daemons and metadata). On Apple Silicon, user data is generally not assigned to Class D.When a user logs in on a FileVault-enabled Apple Silicon Mac: submits the password through the authentication pipeline; upon acceptance, the kernel passes:The supplied password (or a derivative).
to the SEP via AppleSEPKeyStore.The password is run through the configured KDF.The UID key and measurement inputs are combined via the tangling function to derive the PDK.The keybag’s wrapped class keys are unwrapped using the PDK and UID.The unwrapped class keys remain resident only inside SEP-protected memory.The SEP returns  (numeric identifiers or similar) for the class keys to the kernel rather than the keys themselves.Subsequent file I/O and volume operations refer to class keys by these handles, never by raw key bits.10.3.2 Sealed Key Protection (SKP): Binding Data to MeasurementTahoe introduces and extends Sealed Key Protection (SKP) as a defense against “Evil Maid” scenarios where an attacker boots a compromised or downgraded OS to attack the disk encryption keys.The Secure Enclave’s  verifies and measures .The LocalPolicy describing boot and security configuration (e.g. SIP, boot policy, secure boot level).These measurements are accumulated into internal registers within the SEP (conceptually similar to TPM PCRs, but not exposed as such).When the Volume Encryption Key (VEK) and class keys are created (e.g. at install or FileVault enablement time), they are wrapped under a key derived from:The passcode-derived material (PDK).The current boot-chain measurement.KEK = KDF( UID, PDK, Measurement )
WrappedVEK = Encrypt( VEK, KEK )
The same derivation is repeated inside the SEP using the current Measurement.If the OS, LocalPolicy, or relevant firmware has changed in a way that alters the Measurement beyond allowed ranges, the derived KEK will be different and the unwrap will fail—even if the correct password is supplied.To successfully decrypt the data volume, an attacker must:Possess the user’s secret (or otherwise satisfy SEP policy).Boot into an OS configuration that produces an acceptable Measurement (signed, authorized kernel + LocalPolicy consistent with SKP policy).Run on the original or equivalently provisioned hardware (UID key, SEP state).Downgrades to vulnerable kernels, custom kernels, or off-device keybag attacks are blocked at the SKP layer.10.3.3 The Hardware AES Engine & the Wrapped-Key PathA common misconception is that the macOS kernel decrypts file contents. On Apple Silicon, the encryption/decryption of user data is handled by a dedicated  on the SoC, integrated with the memory and storage controllers.When a user process performs a file read:
The APFS driver consults file metadata to obtain:The identifier or handle for the per-file key (wrapped).The relevant class key handle for this file.
The kernel sends:The wrapped per-file key.The class key handle.
to the SEP via AppleSEPKeyStore.Unwraps the per-file key using the class key resident in SEP memory.Programs the SoC’s AES engine with the resulting key via an internal, non-CPU-addressable interface; orRe-wraps the per-file key under an ephemeral engine-only key and passes that to the AES engine.
The kernel issues a read from the NAND-backed storage through the ANS/AGS storage controller, referencing the relevant blocks.
As data flows through the storage path into DRAM:The AES engine decrypts the ciphertext using the key material that was just programmed.The decrypted plaintext is written into the page cache.
The AES engine’s key state is ephemeral and tightly scoped to the I/O operation. The AP never sees the cleartext per-file key; the SEP holds the root class keys and controls when engine keys exist.Forensics and offensive implications:Dumping kernel memory will reveal plaintext file contents (resident in the page cache) but not the keys that decrypted them.Per-file and class keys exist only inside the SEP and (transiently) in engine-private state.Recovering those keys requires either:Compromising the SEP firmware and dumping its internal state (e.g., SRAM, xART).Attacking the AES engine at the hardware level.10.3.4 RE Focus: Analyzing the  Kernel ExtensionThe primary interface between the kernel and the SEP’s key-management logic is the  kernel extension. For Tahoe and Apple Silicon, this binary is the focal point for understanding the proprietary AP ↔ SEP protocol.Key responsibilities (RE-derived)Typical symbols and responsibilities observed across releases include: / related functions:Accept wrapped keys (e.g. from keybags, per-file metadata).Prepare and send unwrap requests to the SEP.Return handles or status to callers in the kernel. / equivalents:Query the SEP for the current lock / unlock state and biometric backoff state.Update kernel-side views of whether user data should be considered accessible.Message demultiplexers (e.g. sep_key_store_client_handle_message):Parse TLV-encoded responses from the SEP.Dispatch them to the correct waiters in the kernel or userland.From a reverse-engineering and exploitation perspective, several patterns emerge:
Keys are referred to by relatively small integer handles in the kernel. Bugs that cause handles to be mis-associated across security domains (system vs. user, different users, different contexts) could allow an attacker to induce the SEP to use a more privileged key than intended. maintains shadow state about lock status, key availability, and pending operations. Any discrepancy between this state and the SEP’s internal view could create TOCTOU-style conditions where:The kernel believes an operation is permitted, but the SEP does not (and vice versa).A key handle is assumed valid when the SEP has already invalidated it.
The AP-side parser for SEP messages handles complex TLV structures. Memory-safety bugs or logic errors here represent a classic attack surface, albeit one increasingly hardened by modern CFI, PAC, and mitigation layers.Tahoe hardening (observed)On Tahoe-era builds, interactions between  and higher-privilege operations (e.g., enabling FileVault, changing recovery keys, altering LocalPolicy-bound state) show evidence of:Additional checks that correlate key operations with TXM / GL1 policy decisions.Stricter coupling between “is this operation permitted under the current Measurement and LocalPolicy?” and “should this unwrap / key creation be forwarded to the SEP?”Public documentation does not yet spell out this coupling, but runtime traces and binary analysis strongly suggest that Apple is moving more of the authorization logic  the kernel and into the measured, SEP-adjacent policy domain.11.0 Conclusion: The Attack Surface LandscapeThe architectural transformation introduced with macOS Tahoe and the M3/M4 silicon generation signifies the end of the "Kernel is King" era. We have moved from a monolithic trust model, where  and  were the ultimate objectives, to a federated security model where the kernel is merely a highly privileged, yet strictly supervised, tenant within a hardware-enforced hypervisor.For the vulnerability researcher, this necessitates a shift in methodology. Fuzzing syscalls is no longer sufficient to compromise the system's root of trust. The new frontier lies in the —the specific, hardware-mediated bridges that allow data and execution flow to traverse the isolated domains.11.1 Summary of Boundary CrossingsThe following matrix details the architectural boundaries, the mechanisms used to traverse them, and the specific attack surface exposed at each junction.11.1.1 Userland (EL0) ↔ Kernel (EL2/VHE)The Traditional Boundary, Hardened by Silicon. (Supervisor Call) instruction triggering a synchronous exception to the kernel exception vector (, or the EL2 alias under VHE on macOS). (Exception Return) restoring  and  from / and / (depending on the concrete VHE configuration). Entry points are signed. The kernel verifies the thread state signature () on return, ensuring return-address and register integrity. The kernel cannot modify its own text or page tables to disable SMEP/SMAP equivalents (/). Page-table integrity and code immutability are ultimately enforced by the SPTM rather than by EL2 alone.The kernel is no longer the final arbiter of virtual memory. When a user process requests , the kernel cannot simply write to the translation tables; it must request the  to map the page. Standard memory corruption (UAF, heap overflow) in kernel extensions still yields privileged kernel execution in the EL2/VHE context. Forging pointers to survive the  path or function-pointer authentication (return addresses, vtables, dispatch tables). The kernel must sanitize user pointers and lengths before passing them to the SPTM. A "Confused Deputy" attack where the kernel is tricked into asking the SPTM to map a privileged page into user space is the new .11.1.2 Kernel (EL2) ↔ Secure Page Table Monitor (GL2)The "Mechanism" Boundary: The New Hypervisor. (Opcode ) with the  in  (encoding Domain + Dispatch Table ID + Endpoint). The 5-bit immediate in the  instruction selects the GXF entry stub and is recorded in . (Opcode ), returning from GL2 to the kernel’s EL2/VHE context. Hardware context switch of / →  and the corresponding GL2 state (, , ). Atomic switch of permission views. Kernel text becomes RO/NX from the GL2 perspective; SPTM text/data become RX/RW as configured for GL2 and remain inaccessible from EL2.– carry arguments (physical page numbers, ASIDs, permission bitmasks, context IDs).  carries the dispatch target ( + table + endpoint). None in the normal call path. The SPTM reads and writes physical memory directly via its own linear map and page-table view. The SPTM enforces a Finite State Machine (FSM) on every physical page (Frame Table). The primary attack vector is finding a sequence of // calls that desynchronizes the SPTM’s view of a page from the hardware’s actual usage (e.g., aliasing a  frame as ). Passing invalid physical addresses, truncated ranges, or edge-case permission combinations to //, especially under high contention or refcounted/shared-frame scenarios. Because invalid or inconsistent requests cause the SPTM to return fatal errors that XNU treats as unrecoverable and converts into kernel panics, timing side-channels or fault-injection during the  window are potential vectors to infer GL2 layout and state (e.g., distinguishing “valid but denied” vs “structurally impossible” transitions via differing panic paths or latencies).11.1.3 Kernel (EL2) ↔ Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)The “Policy” Boundary: Code-Signing and Entitlement Authority. XNU invokes TXM through  and related wrappers. These routines set up a dedicated TXM stack, marshal a call descriptor (selector, argument vector, return buffer), and then perform the CPU sequence required to enter the TXM context. On current iOS releases, reverse-engineering shows that TXM itself uses  to perform in-monitor calls; regarding the XNU-to-TXM interface on Tahoe, initial implementations (e.g., iOS 17) utilized raw  stubs, while the explicit  kernel APIs were introduced in later iterations (iOS 18) to wrap these calls. TXM writes its result into the call descriptor, updates a status field, and returns to XNU, which interprets the status. Depending on selector and flags, some TXM failures are converted into kernel panics. TXM resides in a region whose code and data are owned and typed by SPTM. XNU has no direct write access to TXM text or critical data; changes must go through SPTM retyping and mapping operations. Apple’s OS integrity documentation describes TXM as a lower-privilege component used by SPTM to enforce code-signing and integrity policy. Even if TXM were compromised, SPTM still mediates page-table updates and frame typing; memory integrity does not collapse automatically. XNU passes pointers (or physical addresses) to Code Directories, CMS blobs, trust caches, and entitlement structures, along with lengths and flags. TXM interprets these structures and returns accept/deny decisions plus auxiliary metadata.Dynamic Trust Cache Operations: TXM selectors cover registration and removal of trust-cache entries, enabling or disabling specific code-signing relaxations, and managing development/debug modes. TXM must parse Mach-O headers, CodeDirectories, CMS/ASN.1, entitlements, and various policy structures. Bugs in these parsers can yield powerful policy-manipulation primitives (for example, arbitrary trust-cache entries or coerced acceptance of malformed signatures), but SPTM still constrains what memory mappings are possible.Policy Downgrade and LocalPolicy Handling: Incorrect handling of boot arguments and LocalPolicy data can cause persistent relaxation of code-signing or integrity checks. Exploits here influence what code TXM authorizes, but do not directly grant the ability to arbitrarily rewrite protected frames without also influencing SPTM. If the buffers that TXM inspects are not retyped or otherwise shielded by SPTM, there is a window where DMA or kernel code could mutate them between TXM’s checks and subsequent use. Correct integration of SPTM retyping with TXM’s parsing determines how exploitable such races are.11.1.4 Kernel (EL1) ↔ Secure Enclave (SEP)The "Air Gap" Boundary: The Parallel Computer. Mailbox Registers (Doorbell) + Shared Memory Buffers (DART-mapped). Distinct CPU core, distinct MMU.Memory Protection Engine: SEP memory is encrypted/authenticated inline. L4 IPC format (Endpoints, TLV payloads). Keys are passed as opaque blobs; raw key material never crosses this boundary. Fuzzing the  endpoint handlers (e.g., , ). Modifying the contents of a DART-mapped buffer after the SEP has validated the header but before it processes the payload. Attempting to rollback the  storage state to force the SEP to reuse old nonces or counters.11.1.5 Kernel (EL1) ↔ Exclaves (Secure Domain)The "Microkernel" Boundary: The RingGate. kext marshals data →  (to Secure Kernel) → IPC to Conclave. Enforces physical memory isolation between  and . A strongly-typed IDL serialization format. Exploiting  to route messages to the wrong Conclave. Bugs in the Tightbeam generated code within the Exclave. Flooding the Secure Kernel with Downcalls to starve secure workloads (DoS).11.2 The "Intel Gap": Security Disparities between x86 and Apple SiliconWhile macOS Tahoe presents a unified user experience across architectures, the underlying security reality is a tale of two operating systems. On Apple Silicon, macOS is a hypervisor-managed, hardware-attested fortress. On Intel (x86_64), it remains a traditional monolithic kernel relying on legacy protection mechanisms. This divergence has created a massive "Intel Gap"—a disparity in exploit mitigation so severe that the same vulnerability often yields a trivial root shell on Intel while resulting in a harmless panic on Apple Silicon.For the reverse engineer, understanding this gap is essential for targeting. The Intel architecture represents the "Soft Target," lacking the silicon-enforced boundaries of the SPTM, TXM, and PAC.11.2.1 Lateral Privilege: GL2 vs Ring 0The critical difference between Intel and Apple-silicon Tahoe systems is the existence, on Apple silicon, of a privilege layer  the kernel that continues to enforce memory-integrity invariants even after a kernel compromise.XNU runs at EL2 under the supervision of SPTM in GL2. SPTM is the sole authority for page-table retyping and for managing frame types that correspond to kernel text, page tables, IOMMU tables, and other critical regions.TXM executes in a lower-privilege domain than SPTM and provides code-signing and integrity policy decisions. SPTM calls into TXM to decide whether particular mappings or code images are acceptable, but SPTM remains the arbiter of what is actually mapped and how frames are typed.A kernel exploit that yields KRW in XNU provides strong influence over control flow and data within EL2 and allows attempts to mis-use SPTM/TXM as confused deputies. However, the attacker must still either:Drive SPTM through an illegal but accepted state transition (retyping or mapping), orGain sufficient influence over TXM and then exploit the TXM–SPTM interface,
to obtain equivalent authority over page tables and sealed code.The kernel runs in Ring 0 and directly controls page tables, VT-d configuration, and most integrity mechanisms below the T2’s secure boot checks.There is no SPTM-equivalent hypervisor above Ring 0 enforcing frame typing or page-table integrity at runtime. Once KRW is obtained and static KTRR is bypassed or worked around, the attacker can patch kernel text, alter page tables, and reconfigure DMA mappings with no higher-privilege arbiter.Under this model, KRW on Apple silicon is an intermediate privilege level situated below SPTM/TXM, whereas KRW on Intel is much closer to the maximum privilege available to macOS.11.2.2 Static vs. Dynamic Kernel Integrity (KTRR vs. SPTM)Both architectures attempt to enforce Kernel Text Read-Only Region (KTRR), but the implementation differs fundamentally in flexibility and robustness. On recent Intel Macs, KTRR is implemented via proprietary memory controller registers (configured via ).
 The firmware locks a physical range of memory as Read-Only/Executable. This is . Once the range is locked at boot, it cannot change. This forces the kernel to fit all immutable code into a contiguous block. It cannot protect dynamically loaded drivers (KEXTs) with the same hardware rigor. KEXTs rely on software-managed page tables ( bit), which a compromised kernel can disable. The SPTM manages the Frame Table. This is . The kernel can load a new extension (AKC), link it, and then ask the SPTM to "Seal" it. The SPTM transitions those specific pages to . This allows the "Immutable Kernel" coverage to extend to late-loaded drivers, a feat impossible on the static Intel KTRR implementation.11.2.3 The CFI Chasm: PAC vs. CETControl Flow Integrity (CFI) is the primary defense against ROP/JOP.Pointer Authentication (PAC) is ubiquitous. It protects return addresses (stack), function pointers (heap/data), and C++ vtables. It provides cryptographic diversity based on pointer context. Intel Macs support Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET), specifically Shadow Stacks ( support is limited).
 CET Shadow Stacks protect return addresses effectively, but they do not protect  transfers (function pointers) with the same granularity as PAC. Crucially, Intel has no equivalent to  (Data Key). An attacker on Intel can still perform Data-Oriented Programming (DOP)—swapping valid object pointers or corrupting decision-making flags—without triggering a hardware fault. On Apple Silicon, these pointers are signed; forging them requires a signing gadget.11.2.4 The Root of Trust: T2 vs. On-Die Boot ROMThe boot chain trust anchor differs physically. The Root of Trust is the  (on models 2018-2020).
 The T2 is a discrete bridge. It verifies the  and kernelcache signature  the Intel CPU starts. However, once the Intel CPU is executing, the T2 is effectively a peripheral connected via USB/PCIe. It cannot introspect the Intel CPU's execution state. It cannot stop a runtime kernel exploit. The Root of Trust is the .
 The security logic (SEP, PKA, Boot Monitor) is on the . The Secure Enclave can monitor the power and clock lines of the AP. The SPTM (running on the AP) enforces the boot measurements continuously. The trust chain is not "handed off"; it is maintained throughout the runtime lifecycle.11.2.5 I/O Security: VT-d vs. DARTDMA attacks are a classic method to bypass CPU memory protections. Uses  (Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O).
 The kernel configures the IOMMU tables. If the kernel is compromised, it can reconfigure VT-d to allow a malicious Thunderbolt device to overwrite kernel memory (unless strict "DMA Protection" is enabled and locked, which relies on the kernel's integrity). Uses  (Device Address Resolution Table).
 As detailed in Section 7.2.2, the kernel  write to DART registers. Only the SPTM can map I/O memory. Even a compromised kernel cannot weaponize a peripheral to perform a DMA attack against the monitor or the kernel text, because the SPTM will reject the mapping request.11.2.6 Summary Table: Tahoe on Intel vs Apple SiliconApple Silicon (arm64e, Tahoe)Highest effective privilegeRing 0 kernel with static KIP/KTRR; no higher-privilege macOS component supervising runtime mappingsGL2 SPTM as top-level memory arbiter supervising EL2 XNU; TXM runs below SPTM and supplies code-signing and integrity policy that SPTM consumes for protected mappingsMemory-controller KIP + software-managed page tables; VT-d tables configured by the kernelSPRR + SPTM-mediated retyping and mapping for page tables and DART; kernel cannot directly repoint protected framesStatic KTRR region for core kernel text; many KEXTs rely on page-table flags that the kernel can modifyDynamic sealing of XNU text and AKCs via SPTM/KIP; additional code cannot be introduced as  after boot without passing SPTM’s frame-typing rulesCET (Shadow Stack + IBT) available in hardware; extent of macOS use is not publicly documentedPAC on kernel and userland code, including return addresses and many vtablesVtable / data-pointer protectionNo hardware authentication for data pointers or vtablesPAC on vtables and selected data pointers (DA/GA keys) constrains many forward-edge and DOP-style attacksAMFI / CoreTrust in the kernel enforce policy; T2 participates in secure boot but does not supervise runtime kernel mappingsTXM, running in a domain protected by SPTM, evaluates signatures and integrity policy.

The "Intel Gap" means that legacy Intel Macs are essentially running a different, far more vulnerable operating system, despite sharing the macOS version number. Exploits that require complex, multi-stage chains on M3 (e.g., bypassing PAC, confusing SPTM, racing TXM) can often be reduced to a single Use-After-Free and a ROP chain on Intel. As Apple phases out Intel support, the "easy mode" of macOS exploitation is rapidly vanishing.11.3 Future Trends: The expansion of Exclaves and the death of Kernel ExtensionsThe trajectory of macOS security architecture is not asymptotic; it is directional. Apple is not merely patching vulnerabilities in XNU; they are actively architecting its obsolescence as a security boundary. The "Tahoe" architecture provides the silicon primitives (SPTM, TXM, GL2) required to execute a long-term strategy of .The future of macOS exploitation lies in understanding two concurrent trends: the ossification of the XNU kernel into a static, immutable appliance, and the migration of high-value logic into the opaque, hardware-isolated world of Exclaves.11.3.1 The Deprecation of : The Static KernelFor decades, the ability to load Kernel Extensions (KEXTs) was a defining feature of macOS. It was also its Achilles' heel. KEXTs run at EL1, share the kernel's address space, and historically lacked the rigorous code review applied to the core kernel.The mechanism for this—the  syscall (and the associated  traps)—represents a massive attack surface. It requires the kernel to possess a runtime linker (), capable of resolving symbols, applying relocations, and modifying executable memory.
Apple has systematically introduced userland replacements for kernel drivers: , , , and . In Tahoe, third-party KEXTs are deprecated. The userland tool  manages the policy, but the actual loading still relies on the kernel's ability to link code. Loading a legacy KEXT now requires reducing system security (disabling SIP/Secure Boot) and interacting with the  via  to explicitly authorize the hash.Future State: The Death of the Runtime Linker:
We are approaching a point where the kernel will effectively lose the ability to load dynamic code entirely in "Full Security" mode. The goal is to remove the  logic from the kernel entirely. The Boot Kernel Collection (BKC) (loaded by iBoot) and the Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AKC) (loaded early by ) will be the  permitted executable kernel code. By moving all linking to build-time (kernelcache generation) or boot-time (iBoot verification), Apple can strip the dynamic linker logic () from the runtime kernel. If the kernel doesn't know how to link a Mach-O, it cannot load a rootkit. The  already enforces that  is immutable. The logical next step is for the SPTM to reject  request that attempts to create new  pages after the initial boot sealing phase is complete.
The era of the "Rootkit" is ending. If you cannot introduce new code into EL1 via , and you cannot modify existing code due to KTRR/SPTM, persistence in the kernel becomes impossible. Attackers will be forced to live entirely within data-only attacks (DOP) or move their persistence to userland (which is easier to detect) or firmware (which is harder to achieve).11.3.2 Exclave Expansion: Eating the MonolithIf XNU is the "Insecure World," Exclaves are the "Secure World." Currently, Exclaves are used for high-sensitivity, low-complexity tasks (Privacy Indicators, Passkeys). However, the architecture is designed to scale. Apple is effectively strangling the monolithic kernel by slowly migrating critical subsystems out of EL1 and into Exclaves.Candidates for Migration:The Network Stack ():
Apple has already introduced , a userland networking subsystem. The logical evolution is to move the TCP/IP stack and packet filtering logic into an Exclave.
 A remote code execution vulnerability in the Wi-Fi firmware or the TCP stack would compromise an isolated Exclave, not the entire kernel. The SPTM would prevent the compromised network stack from touching system memory.Filesystem Encryption (APFS):
Currently,  handles key wrapping, but the bulk encryption happens via the AES Engine managed by the kernel. Moving the filesystem driver's cryptographic logic to an Exclave would ensure that even a kernel compromise cannot exfiltrate file keys, as the keys would exist only within the Exclave's memory domain.Audio and Media Processing:
To protect DRM content and prevent microphone eavesdropping, the entire CoreAudio engine could be moved to a "Media Conclave."
As more logic moves to Exclaves, a significant portion of the OS execution flow becomes invisible to standard introspection tools. You cannot DTrace an Exclave. Kernel tracing will show a "black hole" where the request enters  and vanishes until the result returns. The memory of an Exclave is physically unmappable by the kernel. A kernel memory dump (coredump) will contain gaps where the Exclave memory resides.11.3.3 The "Hollow Kernel" HypothesisExtrapolating these trends leads to the .In this future architecture, XNU (EL1) is demoted to a . Its primary role is to:Provide POSIX system call semantics for legacy userland applications.Manage coarse-grained scheduling of CPU resources.Act as a message bus (via ) between userland applications and the real system logic running in Exclaves.
In the traditional model, the Kernel protects the User. In the Hollow Kernel model, the Hardware (SPTM/TXM) protects the System from the Kernel.The kernel is treated as untrusted code.The TCB (Trusted Computing Base) shrinks from "The entire Kernel" to "The SPTM, TXM, and specific Exclaves."A kernel compromise becomes a "Local DoS" or "Privacy Violation" rather than a "System Compromise."11.3.4 The Visibility Gap: The End of Passive AnalysisFor the reverse engineer, this shift is catastrophic for visibility. The interface between XNU and Exclaves is defined by Tightbeam. Unlike MIG, which was relatively static, Tightbeam protocols can evolve rapidly. Reverse engineering the system will require constantly reconstructing these serialization formats. As Apple phases out Intel support completely, they will likely remove the legacy code paths in XNU that supported the "un-isolated" model. This will make the kernel source code (if still released) increasingly divergent from the binary reality running on M-series chips.Hardware-Locked Debugging: Debugging an Exclave likely requires "Red" (Development) fused silicon. Researchers working on retail "Green" (Production) hardware will be effectively locked out of analyzing the internal logic of these secure subsystems, forced to treat them as black boxes and fuzz their inputs via .
macOS is no longer just a Unix system. It is a distributed system running on a single die, governed by a hypervisor that doesn't exist in software. The kernel is dead; long live the Monitor.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Week In Techdirt History: November 16th – 22nd</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/22/this-week-in-techdirt-history-november-16th-22nd/</link><author>Leigh Beadon</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Terence Tao: At the Erdos problem website, AI assistance now becoming routine</title><link>https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115591487350860999</link><author>dwohnitmok</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:27:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pericles - The Radical Who Perfected Greek Democracy Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhny3GGkLyw</link><author>The People Profiles</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Yhny3GGkLyw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6TPU-PvTMvqgzC_AM7_uA">The People Profiles</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone!

The unlikely journey has brought hope to a country with rare reason to celebrate while illuminating the complex politics of the Taliban's relationship to cricket.

Cricket has grown into a vital part of life in Afghanistan - offering glimmers of joy and excitement to the countless Afghans that play and watch the game. And while the stunning achievements of the men's national team have fostered unity and hope, the Taliban's return to power means half of the country is barred from the festivities and many female players were forced to flee their homeland. 

In a crisis-ridden country like Afghanistan, cricketing success is both deeply meaningful to its people and a complex political challenge, presenting the Taliban government with an opportunity to use the sport at home and abroad. Cricket has offered star players like Gulbadin Naib a path from childhood refugee camps to international acclaim, while all over the country young players like Jamal Stanikzai dream of one day taking part in the team's success. For Afghan refugees like former women's national team player Firooza Amiri, cricket is both a beloved sport and a form of resistance. Deutsche Welle accompanies current and former players and fans in Afghanistan, Australia and Dubai to tell the intertwined stories of Afghan cricket.

Now, We Know Where It Came From.</title><link>https://www.404media.co/a-lost-planet-created-the-moon-now-we-know-where-it-came-from/</link><author>Becky Ferreira</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/image3.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to the Abstract! Here are the studies this week that overthrew the regime, survived outer space, smashed planets, and crafted an ancient mystery from clay.First, a queen gets sprayed with acid—and that’s not even the most horrifying part of the story. Then: a moss garden that is out of this world, the big boom that made the Moon, and a breakthrough in the history of goose-human relations.What is this, a regime change for ants?Every so often, a study opens with such a forceful hook that it is simply best for me to stand aside and allow it to speak for itself. Thus:“Matricide—the killing of a mother by her own genetic offspring—is rarely observed in nature, but not unheard-of. Among animal species in which offspring remain with their mothers, the benefits gained from maternal care are so substantial that eliminating the mother almost never pays, making matricide vastly rarer than infanticide.”“Here, we report matricidal behavior in two ant species,  and , where workers kill resident queens (their mothers) after the latter have been sprayed with abdominal fluid by parasitic ant queens of the ants  and .”Mad props to this team for condensing an entire etymological epic into three sentences. Such murderous acts of dynastic usurpation were first observed by Taku Shimada, an ant enthusiast who runs a blog called . Though matricide is sometimes part of a life cycle—like mommy spiders sacrificing their bodies for consumption by their offspring—there is no clear precedent for the newly-reported form of matricide, in which neither the young nor mother benefits from an evolutionary point of view.In what reads like an unfolding horror, the invading parasitic queens “covertly approach the resident queen and spray multiple jets of abdominal fluid at her”—formic acid, as it turns out—that then “elicits abrupt attacks by host workers, which ultimately kill their own mother,” report Shimada and his colleagues.  “The parasitic queens are then accepted, receive care from the orphaned host workers and produce their own brood to found a new colony,” the team said. “Our findings are the first to document a novel host manipulation that prompts offspring to kill an otherwise indispensable mother.”My blood is curdling and yet I cannot look away! Though this strategy is uniquely nightmarish, it is not uncommon for invading parasitic ants to execute queens in any number of creative ways. The parasites are just usually a bit more hands-on (or rather, tarsus-on) about the process. “Queen-killing” has “evolved independently on multiple occasions across [ant species], indicating repeated evolutionary gains,” Shimada’s team said. “Until now, the only mechanistically documented solution was direct assault: the parasite throttles or beheads the host queen, a tactic that has arisen convergently in several lineages.”When will we get an ant Shakespeare?! Someone needs to step up and claim that title, because these queens blow Lady MacBeth out of the water.That’s one small stem for a plant, one giant leaf for plant-kindScientists simply love to expose extremophile life to the vacuum of space to, you know, see how well they do out there. In a new addition to this tradition, a study reports that spores from the moss  survived a full 283 days chilling on the outside of the International Space Station, which is generally not the side of an orbital habitat you want to be stuck on. Even wilder, most of the spacefaring spores were reproductively successful upon their return to Earth. “Remarkably, even after 9 months of exposure to space conditions, over 80% of the encased spores germinated upon return to Earth,” said researchers led by Chang-hyun Maeng of Hokkaido University. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the survival of bryophytes”—the family to which mosses belong—”following exposure to space and subsequent return to the ground.”Congratulations to these mosses for boldly growing where no moss has grown before.Hints of a real-life ghost worldEarth had barely been born before a Mars-sized planet, known as Theia, smashed into it some 4.5 billion years ago. The debris from the collision coalesced into what is now our Moon, which has played a key role in Earth’s habitability, so we owe our lives in part to this primordial punch-up.Scientists have now revealed new details about Theia by measuring the chemical makeup of “lunar samples, terrestrial rocks, and meteorites…from which Theia and proto-­Earth might have formed,” according to a new study. They conclude that Theia likely originated in the inner solar system based on the chemical signatures that this shattered world left behind on the Moon and Earth. “We found that all of Theia and most of Earth’s other constituent materials originated from the inner Solar System,” said researchers led by Timo Hopp of The University of Chicago and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research. “Our calculations suggest that Theia might have formed closer to the Sun than Earth did.”Wherever its actual birthplace, what remains of Theia is buried on the Moon and as  inside Earth’s mantle. Rest in pieces, sister.You’ve heard of the albatross around your neck, but what about the goose on your back? A new study reports the discovery of a 12,000-year-old artifact in Israel that is the “earliest known figurine to depict a human–animal interaction” with its vision of a goose mysteriously draped over a woman’s spine and shoulders.The tiny, inch-high figurine was recovered from a settlement built by the prehistoric Natufian culture and it may represent some kind of sex thing. “We…suggest that by modeling a goose in this specific posture, the Natufian manufacturer intended to portray the trademark pattern of the gander’s mating behavior,” said researchers led by Laurent Davin of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “This kind of imagined mating between humans and animal spirits is typical of an animistic perspective, documented in cross-cultural archaeological and ethnographic records in specific situations” such as an “erotic dream” or “shamanistic vision.”First, the bizarre Greek myth of Leda and the Swan, and now this? What is it about ancient cultures and weird waterfowl fantasies? In any case, my own interpretation is that the goose was just tired and needed a piggyback (or gaggle-back).Thanks for reading! See you next week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How insect brains can do brilliant things | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1T6mnoghasw</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1T6mnoghasw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Insects are a lot smarter than you think. For a long time, scientists believed insects acted mostly out of instinct and weren’t particularly intelligent, in part, because most of them only live for a few weeks. But it turns out, the insect world is far more complex than we previously thought.  

Many insect species have brains the size of a grain of rice, but are still able to store images, shapes, colors and experiences, and can even learn new skills and work with tools.  

In many species, individual insects even develop unique traits and personalities, like bravery or aggressiveness. One reason for this could be that species with diverse individuals can better adapt to environmental changes, giving them an evolutionary advantage for survival.

And this time it’s me.After a night graced by a sickness bug, I’m feeling pretty ropey and hoping for an easy day. Not a day, as it would turn out to be, that involves a street brawl, arrests, screaming matches between contributors and threats of violence. Oh, and one of our team accidentally getting pepper sprayed by police.But, as they say, news waits for no one, and we’ve been invited out with one of Tenerife’s most notorious figures famous for his aggressive approach to removing squatters. It’s become a growing problem on the Canary Islands, as a housing crisis takes grip of the islands.A housing hero – or a bully?To some, Roberto Perez is a hero, tackling those who have essentially stolen people’s homes or businesses to live in themselves.To others, he is a bully with a highly controversial approach, and little regard for the often vulnerable people he confronts.After a short briefing to his team, made up of the area’s hardmen, bouncers and ex-convicts (some of whom are still wearing ankle tags), we set out to their first target: an apartment block occupied by mainly Colombian families.Amid a cacophony of shouting and banging on doors, the men try to negotiate at the entrance of different apartments.What we saw that day is symptomatic of a housing crisis and a squatting problem in Tenerife that has reached boiling point.What we saw that day is symptomatic of a housing crisis and a squatting problem in Tenerife that has reached boiling point.But the occupants know their rights, and they don’t trust Roberto or his team. Within minutes, the police arrive and enter one of the apartments.Pepper spray fiasco symptomatic of the crisisI am in the middle of challenging Roberto about what seemed like intimidating tactics when the officer suddenly emerges, handcuffs Roberto on grounds of coercion and marches him down the stairs, to the indignation of his 15 or so men who followed him protesting his innocence.Outside things heat up further, and the officer whips out his pepper spray and gives all the men a dousing; including our unfortunate Producer/Director, Thom. He valiantly continues filming with streaming eyes – putting my slightly queasy disposition into perspective.I’ll leave the ensuing chaos to the film, but what we saw that day is symptomatic of a housing crisis and a squatting problem in Tenerife that has reached boiling point.92-bed family hotel overrun by squattersSomething that Margarita Dominguez found out the hard way.She was in the middle of selling her 92 bed family hotel when a squatting gang broke in and took over the hotel.Now every room is rented out by the gang, an area of the hotel has been declared a no-go zone and she’s scared to visit her own property.The worst part? Under Spanish law, she still has to pay the utility bills or she could end up in court for coercion. Her last monthly bill was 6,000 euros.We set off to visit the hotel, but everything we’d heard didn’t fill us with confidence that we’d be welcome.After a few loops around the block to suss out the plan, we decided we could delay no longer (another coffee stop maybe? I ask hopefully).Trepidatiously, the team ventured inside, where we found a hotel in ruins, unrecognisable from the lush green promotional video Margarita showed us.We were met with hostility from some men, but we also met people who claimed they’d fled violence and were working, but couldn’t afford the rent on the island.Tourism wages and rent feesThat’s something we heard again and again when speaking with those inside the various occupied buildings we visited; that the minimum wage jobs that much of the tourism industry offers were no match for high rental fees.There are victims on both sides and fewer winners than it first appeared.Others said they had paid to live there and didn’t realise it was owned by someone else.Most of the people we met inside weren’t Spanish, but some had been on the island for decades.There are victims on both sides and fewer winners than it first appeared.And while new hotels keep getting built in the Canaries, without homes to house the new workers that will be needed, the situation is only likely to get worse.Unreported World: Special Substack seriesTo celebrate Unreported World’s 25th anniversary, Channel 4 News has published a special series of newsletters on Substack dedicated to the foreign affairs programme.Each newsletter article – written by our award-winning journalists – has examined and reflected on the extraordinary episodes bringing unique insight.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Clown Show: CDC Website Changed To Suggest Vaccines May Indeed Cause Autism</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/21/clown-show-cdc-website-changed-to-suggest-vaccines-may-indeed-cause-autism/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 03:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I knew this was coming but this still is absolutely maddening. In all of our coverage of RFK Jr., particularly since his vile appointment and confirmation as head of Health and Human Services, it’s been abundantly clear that he’s an anti-vaxxer. While that may seem obvious to most of our readers, it’s important to note that there are a great many Kennedy fans out there who will tell you he’s  that and that he instead is merely seeking more science on the effects of vaccines. Some say this in genuine fashion, while most say it knowing precisely how full of shit they are. The man’s time at DHS has made any debate over this point academic, of course. Every action he’s taking is the action an anti-vaxxer would make, no matter what he may admit to or otherwise. Still, there was enough nuance and subtlety in all of this to give some folks the cover needed to claim that Kennedy isn’t what he plainly is.Well, that time is now past. The CDC recently updated its webpage meant to educate the public on the lack of a link between autism and vaccines to indicate that, hey, there might just be a link after all.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its website to promote the widely debunked claim that vaccines may cause autism. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly linked vaccines to autism, and now the public health agency he oversees is publicly reversing its position to reflect that belief.The CDC site previously said studies showed there was no connection between receiving vaccines and developing autism. HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said the agency updated the site to reflect “gold standard, evidence-based science.”Okay, I’m not going to mince words on this: this change to this publicly facing webpage is unscientific, dangerous, and fucking . It’s one man and his cadre of handpicked anti-vaxxer cronies foisting upon the public guidance that is not built on science or medicine. And it’s patently obvious that the approach here is an unscientific one. There is going to be some nuance here, but this is . Here is the banner at the top of the page after the changes:Let’s go one by one. The first bullet point is by far the stupidest. Scientists simply don’t talk like this. If the CDC would like to have a webpage for every single potential cause of autism that studies haven’t “ruled out”, well, that is going to require a hell of a lot of webpages. Has science ruled out that ghosts don’t cause autism? Or that the hand of god isn’t directly involved? How about, oh I don’t know… turtles? Have there been enough studies done, peer reviewed of course, that specifically rule out the possibility that proximity to turtles doesn’t have some causative link to autism? I can promise you there hasn’t, because that would be insane.In science, the burden of proof is on those who make a claim. In absence of that proof, the proper course of belief is in the null. In other words, scientifically, making a scientific claim puts the onus to prove it on the claimant and puts  onus on anyone else. If I want to argue that turtles cause autism, I have to prove it. Otherwise, you assume no link exists. And  what the CDC’s page  to do. It used to say that there is no link, which is shorthand for the fact that no link has been  to exist, which is precisely the right way to describe this.As for the claim that studies proving a link have been ignored, they very much have not. They’ve either been exposed for their poor methodology or they’ve been debunked. That’s it. And the rest of the research out there indicates, again, there is no link between autism and vaccines.“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has been changed to promote false information suggesting vaccines cause autism,” said Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. “Since 1998, independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people. The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There’s no link between vaccines and autism.”She went on to say, “Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents. We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.”As for CDC’s new assessment of causes of autism, who the actual fuck knows what that means. So far, out of Kennedy at least, we’ve heard that the causes of autism are maybe vaccines, definitely Tylenol (except maybe not), and male circumcision. They’re all over the damned place and there is zero trust from anyone with a couple of brain cells to rub together that any new analysis coming out of this bullshit iteration of the CDC is at all trustworthy.And, people, . We are, right now, on the verge of losing our measles elimination status and it’s because of exactly this kind of bullshit from exactly these assclowns. That has happened because vaccination rates have been steadily falling for two decades and this is going to make it much, much worse. Kennedy should be dragged before Congress for hearings to explain why this change was made, on what scientific basis the change was made, and why in the world impeachment efforts to oust him ought not to begin immediately.Anything less is Congress abdicating its responsibility. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How this founder’s unlikely path to Silicon Valley could become an edge in industrial tech</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/how-this-founders-unlikely-path-to-silicon-valley-could-become-an-edge-in-industrial-tech/</link><author>Connie Loizos</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 03:26:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Young's age and background – things that might seem like disadvantages when it comes to more established industries – have become his secret weapons.

They warned that the move could trigger all kinds of public health and human rights harms.But most people likely shrugged and moved on with their day. Why is that? It’s not that people don’t care. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, 81% of American adults said they were concerned about how companies use their data, and 71% said they were concerned about how the government uses their data.At the same time, though, 61% expressed skepticism that anything they do makes much difference. This is because people have come to expect that their data will be captured, shared and misused by state and corporate entities alike. For example, many people are now accustomed to instinctively hitting “accept” on terms of service agreements, privacy policies and cookie banners regardless of what the policies actually say.At the same time, data breaches have become a regular occurrence, and private digital conversations exposing everything from infidelity to military attacks have become the stuff of public scrutiny. The cumulative effect is that people are loath to change their behaviors to better protect their data − not because they don’t care, but because they’ve been conditioned to think that they can’t make a difference.Where regulation falls shortPolicy reforms could help to change this perception, but they haven’t yet. In contrast to a growing number of countries that have comprehensive data protection or privacy laws, the United States offers only a patchwork of policies covering the issue.At the federal level, the most comprehensive data privacy laws are nearly 40 years old. The Privacy Act of 1974, passed in the wake of federal wiretapping in the Watergate and the Counterintelligence Program scandals, limited how federal agencies collected and shared data. At the time government surveillance was unexpected and unpopular.The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 extended protections against telephone wire tapping to include electronic communications, which included services such as email. But the law did not account for the possibility that most digital data would one day be stored on cloud servers.Since 2018, 19 U.S. states have passed data privacy laws that limit companies’ data collection activities and enshrine new privacy rights for individuals. However, many of these laws also include exceptions for law enforcement access.These laws predominantly take a consent-based approach – think of the pesky banner beckoning you to “accept all cookies” – that encourages you to give up your personal information even when it’s not necessary. These laws put the onus on individuals to protect their privacy, rather than simply barring companies from collecting certain kinds of information from their customers.For years, studies have shown that people claim to care about privacy but do not take steps to actively protect it. Researchers call this the privacy paradox. It shows up when people use products that track them in invasive ways, or when they consent to data collection, even when they could opt out. The privacy paradox often elicits appeals to transparency: If only people knew that they had a choice, or how the data would be used, or how the technology works, they would opt out.But this logic downplays the fact that options for limiting data collection are often intentionally designed to be convoluted, confusing and inconvenient, and they can leave users feeling discouraged about making these choices, as communication scholars Nora Draper and Joseph Turow have shown. This suggests that the discrepancy between users’ opinions on data privacy and their actions is hardly a contradiction at all. When people are conditioned to feel helpless, nudging them into different decisions isn’t likely to be as effective as tackling what makes them feel helpless in the first place.Resisting data disaffectionThe experience of feeling helpless in the face of data collection is a condition we call data disaffection. Disaffection is not the same as apathy. It is not a lack of feeling but rather an unfeeling – an intentional numbness. People manifest this numbness to sustain themselves in the face of seemingly inevitable datafication, the process of turning human behavior into data by monitoring and measuring it.It is similar to how people choose to avoid the news, disengage from politics or ignore the effects of climate change. They turn away because data collection makes them feel overwhelmed and anxious – not because they don’t care.Taking data disaffection into consideration, digital privacy is a cultural issue – not an individual responsibility – and one that cannot be addressed with personal choice and consent. To be clear, comprehensive data privacy law and changing behavior are both important. But storytelling can also play a powerful role in shaping how people think and feel about the world around them.We believe that a change in popular narratives about privacy could go a long way toward changing people’s behavior around their data. Talk of “the end of privacy” helps create the world the phrase describes. Philosopher of language J.L. Austin called those sorts of expressions performative utterances. This kind of language confirms that data collection, surveillance and abuse are inevitable so that people feel like they have no choiceCultural institutions have a role to play here, too. Narratives reinforcing the idea of data collection as being inevitable come not only from tech companies’ PR machines but also mass media and entertainment, including journalists. The regular cadence of stories about the federal government accessing personal data, with no mention of recourse or justice, contributes to the sense of helplessness.Alternatively, it’s possible to tell stories that highlight the alarming growth of digital surveillance and frame data governance practices as controversial and political rather than innocuous and technocratic. The way stories are told affects people’s capacity to act on the information that the stories convey. It shapes people’s expectations and demands of the world around them.The ICE-Medicaid data-sharing agreement is hardly the last threat to data privacy. But the way people talk and feel about it can make it easier – or more difficult – to ignore data abuses the next time around.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MAGA successfully bullied Trump into releasing the Epstein files #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xlDmclmj9Ec</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xlDmclmj9Ec?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 23:12:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Epstein files have united the left and right, forcing President Donald Trump to reverse course and release the documents after months of calling the demands a hoax.

The comments show a rare look at what Google executives are telling its own employees internally. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides to its employees showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Celebrating Books on Building a Better Future</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/join-eff-celebrating-books-building-better-future</link><author>Christian Romero</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/circuit-city-og-static.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:18:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of our favorite—and most important—things that we do at EFF is to work toward a better future.

Unfortunately, while all fifty states have at least flirted with the idea, only Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota, Colorado, California, and Oregon, and Washington have actually passed laws.And among those states, not one has actually enforced them despite a wide array of ongoing corporate offenses (though to be fair to states there is ). Back in June we mentioned how Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll had committed to including right-to-repair requirements in all existing and future Army contracts with manufacturers. Some very light language to this effect was to be included in the latest National Defense Authorization Act by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.But despite the bipartisan popularity of right to repair reforms, companies aren’t keen on losing money via a government crackdown on  their grift. The various policy and lobbying fronts for America’s defense contractors have been busy this fall trying to frame the modest reforms as an affront on innovation to scuttle the reforms as the House and Senate debate over bill versions:“On Friday, Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO Eric Fanning penned an op-ed in the Washington Times arguing that the Senate provision would “cripple innovation” in the defense business.”Nothing quite says “innovation” like aggressively over-charging taxpayers for the repair and maintenance of a litany of often-dated military hardware. There’s ample evidence that just some very modest reforms could save taxpayers untold billions of dollars. One such example illustrated by Driscoll earlier this year:“Driscoll recently pointed to a Black Hawk helicopter part to show how contractor restrictions drive up costs. The original equipment manufacturer refuses to repair or replace a small screen-control knob that grounds the aircraft when it breaks — forcing the Army to purchase an entire new screen assembly for . Driscoll said the Army could make the knob for just .”Pretty typical military industrial complex graft. Which we could easily fix. If the U.S. wasn’t quite so grotesquely corrupt. Organizations like the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) have been making the rounds insisting that there’s nothing that needs fixing, and if there were, actually fixing them would stifle innovation, harm national security, prevent companies from bidding on military contracts, and potentially risk sending sensitive military secrets to dangerous foreign governments.“Military leaders, service members, the White House, and hundreds of small businesses all agree these bipartisan right to repair reforms are desperately needed,” Warren said via email on Friday. “The giant defense contractors fighting these reforms are more interested in innovating new ways to squeeze our military and taxpayers than strengthening our national security.”Companies have spent the better part of five years trotting out all kinds of bogus claims about how right to repair causes a vast parade of horrible outcomes, all of which have been debunked by subsequent government reports. The auto industry, for example, falsely claimed that making it easier and cheaper to access your car’s repair data would be a boon to sexual predators. Apple, for years, tried to argue that making its phones easier and cheaper to repair would turn states into dangerous “meccas for hackers.” Given the immense, often-corrupt influence that military contractors wield over Congress, and the short attention span of the U.S. media, I suspect this is a battle military contractors could ultimately win. And as we’ve seen with state right to repair laws, even if restrictions  passed, seeing them actually enforced with any competent consistency is another matter entirely. Still, the fact that a bipartisan coalition of folks are actively trying to improve things is a lone bright spot in the soggy, corrupt mire that is U.S. consumer protection.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Shameful Case of Kids for Cash</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyPGSJUw87I</link><author>Georg Rockall-Schmidt</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tyPGSJUw87I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 20:52:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5h8yHSUS4n7zPnh0dG0SA">Georg Rockall-Schmidt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Two Pennsylvania judges, Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan, wrongly imprisoned thousands of children in exchange for kickbacks from a for-profit juvenile detention center, PA Child Care.

To modern eyes, Hunters in the Snow might evoke a picture-perfect winter’s day, full of charm and nostalgia that is both familiar and influential, but for Bruegel and his contemporaries, winter was not picturesque, it was harsh, dangerous, and often deadly.

In that sense, the painting’s beauty is inseparable from its melancholy. It is not a ‘celebration’ of winter but a recognition of it, an honest, empathetic portrayal of human beings enduring and coexisting with the overwhelming force of nature. 

It is that bittersweet tension, that makes Hunters in the snow, such an emotive and timeless image.

That’s an actual thing that happened yesterday.Donald Trump spent hours on social media demanding that Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, along with Representatives Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan, and Jason Crow be arrested, tried, and put to death for “seditious behavior” and “treason.”Their crime? Creating a two-minute video explaining that members of the military have a right—and sometimes a duty—to disobey unlawful orders.The same oath that the president, in theory, took as well. The president is saying that elected officials of the opposing party should be put to death for telling people to remember their oath to the Constitution.This comes after weeks of MAGA Republicans insisting that Democrats needed to “tone down the rhetoric” following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. It comes after the assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, who was among several Democratic officials on the killer’s target list.And now the president is calling for elected officials to be put to death for reminding service members of their constitutional oath.The video is worth watching (though, bizarrely, many news sites wouldn’t post it).It’s less than two minutes. The six lawmakers simply remind service members that they have a right, and sometimes a duty, to disobey illegal orders.Trump did not react kindly to this. He started out by SCREAMING that the lawmakers who did this engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and that they “should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL” and that “Their words cannot be allowed to stand.”That post caused the usual unhinged cultists who egg the senile old man on to try to one-up him, and Trump just kept reposting them all.Eventually, of course, some of his followers insisted that reminding soldiers of their oath is “treason” and that they were there for “traitors” who should be hanged. And the president of the United States just kept reposting it all.And, so, it wasn’t long before he directly called for them to be put to death.Let’s be clear about how unhinged this is, going step by step.First, what these elected officials said was absolutely true. The military code of conduct does require that they obey , which by default means they need not follow unlawful orders. And indeed, the Rules for Courts-Martial make it clear that the defenses for disobeying an order includes if it is unlawful. And the standard there is that “a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.”Rule 916(d) of the rules states clearly:Obedience to orders. It is a defense to any offense that the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accusedknew the orders to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawfulSecond, disobeying an order may subject you to a court-martial, but not “sedition” and being sentenced to death. I mean, this should go without saying, but what the fuck?Third, simply  about their rights and obligations under the oath they took to the Constitution is obviously and clearly protected under the First Amendment. Anyone who still thinks the president believes in free speech is a fraud.Fourth, beyond being protected speech, this has nothing to do with “sedition” or “treason.” Sedition is stirring up rebellion against the government. Treason means levying war against the United States. Reminding service members of their oath to the Constitution and their legal right to refuse unlawful orders is neither. It’s the exact opposite—it’s reinforcing their duties as US service members.And, look, even if these elected officials had done something wrong (they haven’t), and even if it broke the law (it didn’t), and even if it was seditious (it’s not even remotely close), it’s  wrong and ridiculously, unfathomably out of line for the president to be saying they deserve the death penalty.Of course, Trump’s tantrum has amplified this message far beyond what the original video would have reached. And according to a Military Times survey, 80% of US troops already understand their duty to disobey illegal orders anyway. All Trump’s rage has accomplished is reminding even more people—including his own supporters in uniform—of something they already knew.Remember: this comes right after his MAGA colleagues spent weeks demanding Democrats “lower the temperature” following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Yet here’s the president telling his followers that these officials deserve to die, forcing Democrats to alert the Capitol Police and the House Sergeant at Arms to protect these lawmakers and their families.Congress should be calling for impeachment. Instead, you have the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, doing his usual run for cover routine by claiming that “attorneys will have to parse the language.”That’s a hell of a position from someone who, two months ago, insisted that calling Republicans “fascist” was tantamount to inciting violence:Mike Johnson: "People have got to stop framing simple policy disagreements in terms of existential threats to our democracy. You can't call the other side fascists and enemies of the state and not understand that there are some deranged people in our society who will take that as cues to act."Seems like quite the double standard. When the president literally calls for his political enemies to be put to death, he deflects and wants “the attorneys” to “parse the language,” but should anyone refer to the authoritarian attacks on the institutions of the United States, he’ll immediately condemn you for inciting violence.But, of course, that is the MAGA way: they can say what they want, you have to shut up. They can encourage and incite violence, but anything you say that’s a little mean to them is beyond the pale.History will remember those who did the right thing and those who enabled our mad king and his unhinged violent fantasies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dope Tech: STILL so good!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvP-uVNwnXo</link><author>Marques Brownlee</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RvP-uVNwnXo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 19:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ">Marques Brownlee</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks Google for having #sponsored a portion of this video #shopwithgoogle.

It’s only interested in removing people who aren’t . That’s why it vets visa applicants for “anti-American” social media posts while throwing the immigration door wide open for any white people seeking to escape the “persecution” they face in post-apartheid South Africa.And that’s why so many people being arrested and deported don’t fit the profile of the “worst of the worst.” There simply aren’t enough criminal immigrants in America. Too much of our crime is home-grown and even if you’re a racist who thinks Black people are skewing the data, the data still shows white people commit crime more frequently than immigrants. Back in September, federal officers rolled up on a fire crew in Washington state. Washington is already on the list of states Trump doesn’t like. The fact that these firefighters were on loan from Oregon — a state Trump (to the point of martial law) doesn’t like — surely factored into this equation.After hassling a bunch of people just trying to keep a wildfire from spreading, the collective of federal officers only managed to secure two arrests. One of those was Jose Cruz-Estrada, who had been working as a firefighter since 2019. Officers arrested him and deported him to Mexico. In defense of its raid on firefighters, DHS said this: The two illegal aliens apprehended were NOT firefighters. The two contracted work crews questioned on the day of their arrests were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood. The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time. No active firefighters were even questioned, and U.S. Border Patrol’s actions did not prevent or interfere with any personnel actively engaged in firefighting efforts.They  firefighters. Just because they weren’t on the fire line didn’t mean they weren’t doing work to support firefighting efforts. This statement also lied about Cruz-Estrada’s role in firefighting, which involved more than this alleged response to a Bureau of Land Management investigation into the contractor’s hiring practices. Once it became clear Cruz-Estrada was not just some migrant hastily hired to handle a wildfire, the DHS decided to amp up its deliberately misleading narrative. It issued a press release that had this to say about the firefighter (emphasis in the original): Jose Bertin Cruz-Estrada, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico, past charges include the delivery and selling of methamphetamine. Border Patrol previously encountered this criminal illegal alien 15 times. Cruz-Estrada has a final order of removal from April 2015 and was last removed from the United States on February 27, 2016. He chose to disregard our laws and illegally re-enter the country again.[I]n 2013, he got caught up in the criminal legal system after a local drug bust. Officers, records show, were not focused on Cruz-Estrada, but rather a resident of a home where Cruz-Estrada was hanging out. An informant bought drugs from the resident and secretly filmed the encounter; police accused Cruz-Estrada of being a “lookout”, because he was seen leaving the home and “walking around the surrounding area”, a prosecutor wrote.Cruz-Estrada was charged with a litany of serious offenses, including racketeering and unlawful delivery of methamphetamine, but the charges were dismissed in exchange for him pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to deliver meth, acharge stemming from the “lookout” allegations.The conviction carried no prison time.This is the evidence the DHS thinks is so damning: someone was once accused of serious drug crimes more than a decade ago and served no time in prison for the single charge the government secured via a plea deal. Since then, he has worked for firefighting crews when not running his own business, which he incorporated in 2022. But fuck him, I guess, for not trying to obtain citizenship during Trump’s first term. Cruz-Estrada re-entered the US illegally in 2019, which wasn’t exactly the best time to be asking for asylum or trying to fast-track a citizenship application. But he went back to firefighting, contributing to several major wildfire-fighting efforts over the next six years. And yet, this government continues to insist this is  the kind of person the United States should have fewer of. When asked for a comment on this recent article, the foul front-mouth of the DHS decided to spew the usual bullshit, letting everyone who doesn’t respond to racist dog whistling know that this administration is doing this to Cruz-Estrada because it simply doesn’t like people from Mexico:[DHS Asst. Secretary Tricia McLaughlin] said the border patrol had “encountered” Cruz-Estrada 15 times over the years and again cited his past criminal charges without noting they were dismissed. “Once again, the Guardian is debasing itself by peddling sob stories from a criminal illegal alien … Stop publishing criminal illegal aliens’ testimonies as the truth.”That’s the sort of thing you say when you have no real argument to make. You re-read the jacket, gloss over the lack of a serious conviction, refuse to acknowledge the fact that the offense occurred well over a decade ago, and insult the people asking you to explain your actions. This person should not be allowed to issue a Teams meeting invitation, much less serve as the underboss for Kristi “I Kill Pets” Noem. Cruz-Estrada is the sort of person who actually makes America great: a human being as capable of failure as the rest of us, but willing to turn his life around and be a positive force in this nation — something far too few US natives are interested in doing. Migrants never get to rest on their laurels. Meanwhile, the MAGA crowd remains kicked back on the laurel lounger it scored at an asset forfeiture auction, applauding an administration that is deliberately destroying the American ideals these shitheels claim to love so much it might occasionally mean having to drink something other than Bud Light for a few weeks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Baofu Compound: A POGO Hub Home to a Scam Compound</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tEEjDGNcy6Q</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tEEjDGNcy6Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:01:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Baofu Compound, a 20-acre site in Bamban, Tarlac in the Philippines, was home to a massive POGO hub.

From its beginnings right through to the present day, the country's armed forces have shaped both American identity and the political decisions of its leaders.

The United States of America has been at war throughout most of its 250-year existence. From the War of Independence right through to contemporary armed conflicts, the nation's armed forces have not only shaped American identity but also influenced the political decisions of its leaders.
The documentary takes a deep dive into this complex history and analyzes the "hot" and "cold" wars that have shaped US history in order to draw important lessons for the future.

The film explores how successive generations of US Americans viewed and experienced each conflict. It also examines the enduring impact of these wars on American society and reveals how military engagement was utilized to hone the image and the role of the US on the global stage.
Around 30 high-profile experts, military personnel and politicians examine the military history of the United States, explaining its successes and failures, as well as its impact on the world and the everyday lives of Americans.

The film looks to the past to gain a keener understanding of how today's military decisions will affect tomorrow's world — as well as their far-reaching impact on democracy and society. And with US President Donald Trump now in office for a second term, it asks what role the army plays in Trump's world view.

Sam’s piece on an exposed AI porn platform ended up with the company closing off those exposed images. Our months-long reporting and pressure from lawmakers  of the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), in which a company owned by the U.S.’s major airlines sold flyers data to the government for warrantless surveillance.For the quick bit of context I have typed many, many times this year: that company is Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), and is owned by United, American, Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, Alaska, Lufthansa, Air France, and Air Canada. ARC gets data, including a traveler’s name, credit card used, where they’re flying to and from, whenever someone books a flight with one of more than 10,000 travel agencies. Think Expedia, especially. ARC then sells access to that data to a slew of government agencies, including ICE, the FBI, the SEC, the State Department, ATF, and more.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: OCR Arena – A playground for OCR models</title><link>https://www.ocrarena.ai/battle</link><author>kbyatnal</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:44:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Upload an image to start an anonymous OCR battleNeed a document?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Wealthfolio 2.0- Open source investment tracker.

Court Ends Dragnet Electricity Surveillance Program in Sacramento</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/victory-court-end-dragnet-electricity-surveillance-program-sacramento</link><author>Mario Trujillo</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/smart_meter_surveillance_final.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:30:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A California judge ordered the end of a dragnet law enforcement program that surveilled the electrical smart meter data of thousands of Sacramento residents.The Sacramento County Superior Court ruled that the surveillance program run by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and police violated a state privacy statute, which bars the disclosure of residents’ electrical usage data with narrow exceptions. For more than a decade, SMUD coordinated with the Sacramento Police Department and other law enforcement agencies to sift through the granular smart meter data of residents without suspicion to find evidence of cannabis growing.EFF and its co-counsel represent three petitioners in the case: the Asian American Liberation Network, Khurshid Khoja, and Alfonso Nguyen. They argued that the program created a host of privacy harms—including criminalizing innocent people, creating menacing encounters with law enforcement, and disproportionately harming the Asian community.The court ruled that the challenged surveillance program was not part of any traditional law enforcement investigation. Investigations happen when police try to solve particular crimes and identify particular suspects. The dragnet that turned all 650,000 SMUD customers into suspects was not an investigation.“[T]he process of making regular requests for all customer information in numerous city zip codes, in the hopes of identifying evidence that could possibly be evidence of illegal activity, without any report or other evidence to suggest that such a crime may have occurred, is not an ongoing investigation,” the court ruled, finding that SMUD violated its “obligations of confidentiality” under a data privacy statute.Granular electrical usage data can reveal intimate details inside the home—including when you go to sleep, when you take a shower, when you are away, and other personal habits and demographics.In creating and running the dragnet surveillance program, according to the court, SMUD and police “developed a relationship beyond that of utility provider and law enforcement.” Multiple times a year, the police asked SMUD to search its entire database of 650,000 customers to identify people who used a large amount of monthly electricity and to analyze granular 1-hour electrical usage data to identify residents with certain electricity “consumption patterns.” SMUD passed on more than 33,000 tips about supposedly “high” usage households to police.While this is a victory, the Court unfortunately dismissed an alternate claim that the program violated the California Constitution’s search and seizure clause. We disagree with the court’s reasoning, which misapprehends the crux of the problem: At the behest of law enforcement, SMUD searches granular smart meter data and provides insights to law enforcement based on that granular data.Going forward, public utilities throughout California should understand that they cannot disclose customers’ electricity data to law enforcement without any “evidence to support a suspicion” that a particular crime occurred.EFF, along with Monty Agarwal of the law firm Vallejo, Antolin, Agarwal, Kanter LLP, brought and argued the case on behalf of Petitioners.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Video Friday: Watch Robots Throw, Catch, and Hit a Baseball</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-baseball-robot</link><author>Evan Ackerman</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIyMTU0NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDc5MTI4N30.4J0sPXNPGpD9L1qSJVh7kVr5V_FXhcLBl8B4ix61elo/image.png?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:20:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Your weekly selection of awesome robot videos]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blaise Agüera y Arcas: Can AI Become Conscious? | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYA8lqbXkqk</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZYA8lqbXkqk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:00:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can AI become conscious or will machines always just simulate awareness?

They discuss the nature of mind, the limits of machine learning, and whether AI systems could one day have subjective experience, emotions, or self-awareness. What would it mean if a neural network felt something?

The US invasion of Iraq was the culmination of several developments that started at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. In 2002, the Bush administration used the excuse of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) and claimed links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda to justify the invasion.

Perhaps with the exception of more lip filler, spray tans, diabetes, bogus efficiency, and fake piety. That’s been particularly true for Trump’s attack on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which has done a lot of heavy lifting in recent years when it comes to thwarting security threats, maintaining election cybersecurity, providing useful threat assessments for orgs that can’t afford to do their own, and even deterring the spread of misinformation about government security.The Verge has a good read on how important key spots in DHS and CISA have been filled by weird and incompetent Trump-loyal zealots, causing chains of failures across U.S. cybersecurity defenses. So when things happen, like Iranian government-linked hackers accessing and modifying Arizona election websites, people can no longer trust CISA to competently lend a hand:“It was late June, and something strange was happening on Arizona’s online portal for political candidates. Images of the candidates were disappearing. Photos of the Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini were popping up in their place. The state would later come to believe it was an attack from an Iranian government-affiliated group. When they first discovered the threat, though, they were in the dark — and they needed help.Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes’ office took action to contain the threat, which he says did not impact personal voter information. But one thing he didn’t do was contact the federal agency that would have once been among Fontes’ first calls: CISA.”This  harm, and even kill, a lot of people. MAGA loyalists don’t care because they aren’t interested in leadership and governance, they’re interested in scrapping the country for parts and selling it off the back loading dock. Whether or not that lines up with foreign governments and criminal organizations keen on undermining national security isn’t something they’re bright enough to understand or ethical enough to care about.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to make life’s toughest decisions #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SWSX_-UfEoY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SWSX_-UfEoY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re relying on a simple pro/con list to make some of the biggest decisions of your life, you’re selling yourself short. As the philosopher Ruth Chang points out, life-altering choices are rarely straightforward, and often neither option is superior. Instead of trying to quantify the unquantifiable, consider who you want to become — and how each path might shape your character, your values, and your future. #philosophy #proscons

Since then, a lot has happened, but the sky has yet to fall. Were the experts wrong? Or is it too early to tell?

The seeming end of free trade has caused a frenetic scramble as nations and companies seek to soften the blow. Trump’s gamble on US magnetism appears to have yielded some wins, but whether they last remains to be seen. Is his strategy a way to protect America’s preeminent role in the world, or will it merely hasten its retreat?

Following a childhood marred by illness and death, John earned a medical degree before returning to run the Sanitorium – a health and wellness centre – in his hometown, where he prescribed a variety of treatments both sensible and surreal, including a vegetarian diet, fresh air and exercise, hydrotherapy, and regular enemas! He was soon joined in his wellness venture by his business-minded brother Will, and together they invented a breakfast cereal we still know and love today: cornflakes. But after years of John’s bullying, Will left to launch his own business: the Kellogg company.This episode tells the story of these battling brothers and their food and wellness business ventures, exploring everything from their sibling relationship and the competing stories they tell about the invention of their most famous cereal, to John’s Seventh Day Adventist beliefs and his pioneering wife with her meat-free meal replacements.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

I had a bit of a laugh shortly after this turd was filed, mainly because Kennedy himself came out after the lawsuit was filed to walk back the claims made in the press conference and acknowledged that all that science he and Trump cited “is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism.” And, while Trump repeatedly instructed women to not take Tylenol while pregnant, a stance medical professionals overwhelmingly disagree with, Kennedy instead said women should consult with their doctors on its use. A Texas Judge has rejected a request from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to issue a temporary order barring Tylenol’s maker, Kenvue, from claiming amid litigation that the pain and fever medication is safe for pregnant women and children, according to court documents.In records filed Friday, District Judge LeAnn Rafferty, in Panola County, also rejected Paxton’s unusual request to block Kenvue from distributing $400 million in dividends to shareholders later this month.Now, it’s important to acknowledge that Paxton is simply doing performative MAGA bullshit with this lawsuit. He’s running for the Senate seat currently held by John Cornyn, who is also seeking reelection. Wesley Hunt joins them to compete in the Republican primary for the seat. All of these men are simply attempting to out-MAGA one another. The TRO request to keep Kenvue, current makers of the Tylenol brand, from stating that its product is safe for use by pregnant women and children, was always absurd. But it was made all the more so when Kennedy walked back his press conference claims. Judge Rafferty noted that she:…denied the marketing claim, which even the Trump administration is not standing by. The day after Paxton filed his lawsuit, Kennedy said that “the causative association… between Tylenol given in pregnancy and the perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism.”Like I said in my previous post on this: very funny.As for the dividend disbursement, for which Paxton relies on a Texas law preventing companies giving out such funds if they are about to become financially insolvent, the court simply didn’t have jurisdiction to issue any such order.According to Reuters, one of Kenvue’s lawyers, Kim Bueno, explained that the problem with the state of Texas making this request is that Kenvue is based in New Jersey and incorporated in Delaware. “There was no jurisdiction to challenge that,” she said.All this flailing about would be merely unbecoming, except that Paxton is a damned state AG. He should, and likely does, know better than all of this. As I said before, this is performative nonsense designed to do nothing more than gain primary votes in a Senate race.But in today’s political climate, you can see just how much chaos can be generated by an ignoramus like RFK Jr.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Compute Runtime 25.44.36015.5 Brings More Performance Optimizations &amp; Features</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-CR-25.44.36015.5</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 01:47:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Released tonight was the Intel Compute Runtime 25.44.36015.5 as their roughly monthly update to this open-source GPU compute stack providing Level Zero and OpenCL support for Intel's integrated and discrete graphics hardware...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ctrl-Alt-Speech: You Can’t Antitrust Anyone These Days</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/ctrl-alt-speech-you-cant-antitrust-anyone-these-days/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:27:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this week’s round-up of the latest news in online speech, content moderation and internet regulation, Mike and Ben cover:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>21/11/2025 Box Office Top Ten</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckOogyOSmzY</link><author>Kermode and Mayo&apos;s Take</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ckOogyOSmzY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErmMCK1sHF-kCtyHpuSXtQ">Movies - Kermode</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#MarkKermode #SimonMayo #FilmReviews

Comparing these groups is like comparing apples and bricks: They may both be organizations, but that’s where the resemblance stops.Noem’s statement echoed the logic of a September 2025 Trump administration executive order that designated antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization.” The order directs all relevant federal agencies to investigate and dismantle any operations, including the funding sources, linked to antifa.The FBI and DHS have classified certain anarchist or anti-fascist groups under the broad category of “domestic violent extremists.” But neither agency nor the State Department has ever previously designated antifa as a terrorist organization.The data on political violence reinforces this point.By contrast, the organizations Noem invoked – Hamas, the Islamic State group and MS-13 – share structural and operational characteristics that antifa lacks.In short, they are military or criminal organizations with strategic intent. Noem’s claim that antifa is “just as dangerous” as these groups is not only empirically indefensible but rhetorically reckless.Turning dissent into ‘terrorism’So why make such a claim?Noem’s statement fits squarely within the Trump administration’s broader political strategy that has sought to inflate the perceived threat of left-wing activism.Casting antifa as a domestic terrorist equivalent of the Islamic State nation or Hamas serves several functions.Antifa’s decentralized structure makes it a convenient target for blame. That’s because it lacks clear boundaries, leadership and accountability. So any act by someone identifying with antifa can be framed as representing the whole movement, whether or not it does. And by linking antifa to terrorist groups, Noem, the top anti-terror official in the country, turns a political talking point into a claim that appears to carry the weight of national security expertise.The problem with this kind of rhetoric is not just that it’s inaccurate. Equating protest movements with terrorist organizations blurs important distinctions that allow democratic societies to tolerate dissent. It also risks misdirecting attention and resources away from more serious threats — including organized, ideologically driven groups that remain the primary source of domestic terrorism in the U.S.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canonical Gets Flutter Up And Running On RISC-V For Ubuntu</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Canonical-Flutter-On-RISC-V</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 21:04:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canonical has been bullish on RISC-V with Ubuntu being one of the most common Linux distributions endorsed by RISC-V board vendors.

The fact that even Trump’s own judicial appointees unanimously rejected his claims demolishes any narrative that this case had merit or that “biased” courts are persecuting him. This was simply a loser case that never should have been brought.The appeals court’s analysis cuts straight to the heart of why Trump’s lawsuit was doomed from the start. The term “Big Lie” isn’t a factual claim that can be proven true or false—it’s CNN’s characterization of Trump’s conduct, protected opinion under the First Amendment.Trump’s argument is unpersuasive. First, although he concedes that CNN’s use of the term “Big Lie” is, to some extent, ambiguous, he assumes that it is unambiguous enough to constitute a statement of fact. This assumption is untenable. Although we haven’t squarely addressed the point, case law from other circuits is persuasive. In Buckley v. Littell, 539 F.2d 882 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1062 (1977), the Second Circuit held that, by using the terms “fascist,” “fellow traveler,” and “radical right” to describe William F. Buckley, Jr., the defendant was not publishing “statements of fact.” Buckley, 539 F.2d at 893. Rather, the court ruled, the terms were “so debatable, loose and varying[] that they [we]re insusceptible to proof of truth or falsity.” Id. at 894. Similarly, in Ollman v. Evans, 750 F.2d 970 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (en banc), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1127 (1985), the D.C. Circuit held that when the defendant called the plaintiff “an outspoken proponent of political Marxism,” his statement was “obviously unverifiable.” Ollman, 750 F.2d at 987. Trump argues that the term “Big Lie” is less ambiguous than the terms “fascist,” “fellow traveler,” “radical right,” and “outspoken proponent of political Marxism.” But he does not explain this assertion. If “fascist”—a term that is, by definition, political—is ambiguous, then it follows that “Big Lie”—a term that is facially apolitical—is at least as ambiguous.The court’s comparison to terms like “fascist” and “fellow traveler” is particularly damaging to Trump’s case. If calling William F. Buckley Jr. a “fascist” constitutes protected opinion rather than actionable defamation, then CNN’s characterization of Trump’s election claims as a “Big Lie” clearly falls on the same side of the line. The panel essentially argues that Trump wants special protection from political criticism that no other public figure enjoys.Second, Trump’s argument hinges on the fact that his own interpretation of his conduct—i.e., that he was exercising a constitutional right to identify his concerns with the integrity of elections—is true and that CNN’s interpretation—i.e., that Trump was peddling his “Big Lie”—is false. However, his conduct is susceptible to multiple subjective interpretations, including CNN’s.Trump’s lawyers apparently thought they had found a silver bullet in the sheer volume of CNN’s coverage, arguing that more instances of the phrase somehow transformed opinion into defamation. The appeals court wasn’t buying it. If the thing is protected opinion five times, it’s protected opinion 10,000 times. It’s just speech.Trump’s other arguments are likewise meritless. He argues that the district court erred in limiting its analysis to the five defamatory statements that he listed in his complaint. According to Trump, the district court should have also analyzed the “more than sixty instances of defamation set forth in the Notice Letter to CNN” and the “nearly 7,700 instances in which CNN had defamed Plaintiff with the ‘Big Lie’ allegation.” Brief of Appellant at 18. Trump has not alleged that any of these “instances of defamation” refer to something other than CNN’s use of “Big Lie.” We have held that, by using “Big Lie” to describe Trump, CNN was not publishing a false statement of fact. Therefore, whether CNN used “Big Lie” one time or many is irrelevant to the question of falsity.This logic-chopping attempt reveals the fundamental weakness of Trump’s entire approach. He’s essentially arguing that repeating a protected opinion enough times magically transforms it into actionable defamation—a legal theory with no basis in the First Amendment whatsoever.Trump, whose lawyers appeared to throw every possible argument at the court, also claimed that the lower court’s denial of his attempt to amend the lawsuit and try again was an abuse of the court’s discretion. The appeals court explains to Trump’s lawyers, that’s not how any of this actually works.Trump argues that, when the district court denied his motion for leave to amend, it applied a standard that was too strict. Essential to his argument is his claim that the district court did not issue a judgment when it dismissed his complaint with prejudice. “In these circumstances,” Trump argues, “leave to amend should have been ‘granted liberally.’” Brief of Appellant at 41 (quoting Czeremcha v. International Ass’n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, 724 F.2d 1552, 1556 & n. 6 (11th Cir. 1984)). But Trump overlooks that, in its order, the district court indicated that “dismissal of the complaint constituted dismissal of the action.” Id. After dismissing Trump’s complaint with prejudice, the court stated that “[t]he Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE this case and DENY AS MOOT any pending motions.” Trump, 684 F. Supp. 3d at 1277. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Trump’s motion for leave to amend.Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in denying Trump’s motion for reconsideration under Rule 59. Trump asserts that the district court (1) “fail[ed] to consider the entirety of the circumstances surrounding CNN’s publication of the challenged statements” and (2) “appeared to reframe its understanding of [the clear error] standard in a manner unrelated to the case.” Brief of Appellant at 51–52, 55). “The only grounds for granting [a Rule 59] motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.” Arthur v. King, 500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (quoting In re Kellogg, 197 F.3d 1116, 1119 (11th Cir. 1999)). Neither of Trump’s points involve newly discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact, and the record confirms that the district court cited and applied the correct standard. We find no abuse of discretion.This ruling represents more than just another failed Trump lawsuit—it’s a textbook example of how SLAPP suits are supposed to be handled by the courts. Trump’s case had all the hallmarks: a thin-skinned public figure using expensive litigation to punish media criticism, weak legal theories designed more to harass than to win, and endless procedural gamesmanship when the substantive claims inevitably failed.What makes this particularly significant is that the rejection comes from a panel that includes two of Trump’s own judicial appointees. This demolishes the narrative that Trump’s legal failures stem from “biased” courts rather than fundamentally weak cases. When even judges you appointed won’t buy your legal theories, that’s a pretty clear signal that the problem isn’t judicial activism—it’s your vexatious case.The broader context here matters. Trump has weaponized defamation law as a tool to silence media criticism throughout his career, filing lawsuit after lawsuit against news organizations that report unflattering truths about him. Most of these cases follow the same pattern: grandiose claims, weak legal theories, and inevitable failure in court. But the process is the punishment—forcing news organizations to spend time and money defending their basic right to engage in political commentary.There’s nothing new or novel about this case. There’s no deep need to explore some nuance of defamation law here. This is just a garden variety SLAPP suit by one of the most petulant thin-skinned presidents we’ve ever had who regularly loves to abuse the legal system to try to silence and suppress media who doesn’t praise his every move.In theory, Trump could seek an en banc rehearing by the entire Eleventh Circuit or petition the Supreme Court to review this decision, but both moves would be long shots at best. The legal principles here are well-established, the factual record is clear, and there’s no circuit split or novel constitutional question that would warrant further review. This case is a dead end, which is exactly where it belonged from the start.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I’m concerned Trump could tamper with the Epstein files release – Congressman</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/im-concerned-trump-could-tamper-with-the-epstein-files-release-congressman</link><author>Matt Frei</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:14:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam is on the House of Representatives’ Oversight Committee – he co-wrote the letter to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor requesting his co-operation.He’s also accused Andrew of ‘hiding.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Trump Administration’s Order on AI Is Deeply Misguided</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/trump-administrations-order-ai-deeply-misguided</link><author>Hayley Tsukayama</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/capitol-2.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:10:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Widespread news reports indicate that President Donald Trump’s administration has prepared an executive order to punish states that have passed laws attempting to address harms from artificial intelligence (AI) systems. According to a draft published by news outlets, this order would direct federal agencies to bring legal challenges to state AI regulations that the administration deems “onerous,”  to restrict funding to those states that have these laws, and to adopt new federal law that overrides state AI laws.This approach is deeply misguided.While state AI laws have not been perfect, they are genuine attempts to address harms that people across the country face from certain uses of AI systems right now. Given the tone of the Trump Administration’s draft order, it seems clear that the preemptive federal legislation backed by this administration will  stop ways that automated decision making systems can result in discriminatory decisions.For example, a copy of the draft order published by Politico specifically names the Colorado AI Act as an example of supposedly “onerous” legislation. As we said in our analysis of Colorado’s law, it is a limited but crucial step—one that needs to be strengthened to protect people more meaningfully from AI harms. It is possible to guard against harms and support innovation and expression. Ignoring the harms that these systems can cause when used in discriminatory ways is not the way to do that.And all of us will pay the price.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John Behr - Why Study Theology?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYTUYzH_-X8</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DYTUYzH_-X8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Make a donation to help Closer To Truth continue exploring the world's deepest questions without the need for paywalls: https://closertotruth.com/donate/

Frederick Trump was a poor German barber’s son who crossed the Atlantic as a teenager and died a wealthy American businessman. In between, he chased the Gold Rush, ran hotels and brothels on the frontier, and laid the financial foundations for one of the most controversial political dynasties in modern history. This is the story of the immigrant who started the Trump dynasty.

In this full-length biographical documentary, we follow Frederick Trump’s journey from Kallstadt in the Kingdom of Bavaria to the raw, lawless world of the American West and the Klondike Gold Rush. Long before Donald Trump entered politics or became a global celebrity, his grandfather was building the family fortune in an America of opportunity, corruption and rapid change.

According to lawyers representing people detained at the facility, it is unclear whether the government is even trying to recover the footage; government lawyers, meanwhile, said “we don’t have the resources” to continue preserving surveillance footage from the facility and suggested that immigrants detained at the facility (or their lawyers) could provide “endless hard drives where we could save the information, that might be one solution.” It should be noted that ICE and Border Patrol agents continued to be paid during the government shutdown, that Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” provided $170 billion in funding for immigration enforcement and border protection, which included tens of billions of dollars in funding for detention centers. People detained at the facility are suing the government over alleged horrific treatment and living conditions at the detention center, which has become a site of mass protest against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. Solotorovsky said that the footage the government has offered is from between September 28 and October 19, and from between October 31 and November 7. Government lawyers have said they are prepared to provide footage from five cameras from those time periods; Solotorovsky said the plaintiffs’ attorneys believe there are 63 surveillance cameras total at the facility. He added that over the last few weeks the plaintiffs’ legal team has been trying to work with the government to figure out if the footage can be recovered but that it is unclear who is doing this work on the government’s side. He said they were referred to a company called Five by Five Management, “that appears to be based out of a house,” has supposedly been retained by the government. “We tried to engage with the government through our IT specialist, and we hired a video forensic specialist,” Solotorovsky said. He added that the government specialist they spoke to “didn’t really know anything beyond the basic specifications of the system. He wasn’t able to answer any questions about preservation or attempts to recover the data.” He said that the government eventually put him in touch with “a person who ostensibly was involved in those events [attempting to recover the data], and it was kind of a no-name LLC called Five by Five Management that appears to be based out of a house in Carol Stream. We were told they were on site and involved with the system when the October 20 to 30 data was lost, but nobody has told us that Five By Five Management or anyone else has been trying to recover the data, and also very importantly things like system logs, administrator logs, event logs, data in the system that may show changes to settings or configurations or deletion events or people accessing the system at important times.”Five by Five Management could not be reached for comment.Solotorovsky said those logs are going to be critical for “determining whether the loss was intentional. We’re deeply concerned that nobody is trying to recover the data, and nobody is trying to preserve the data that we’re going to need for this case going forward.”Jana Brady, an assistant US attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security in the case, did not have much information about what had happened to the footage, and said she was trying to get in touch with contractors the government had hired. She also said the government should not be forced to retain surveillance footage from every camera at the facility and that the “we [the federal government] don’t have the resources to save all of the video footage.”“We need to keep in mind proportionality. It took a huge effort to download and save and produce the video footage that we are producing and to say that we have to produce and preserve video footage indefinitely for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, indefinitely, which is what they’re asking, we don’t have the resources to do that,” Brady said. “we don't have the resources to save all of the video footage 24/7 for 65 cameras for basically the end of time.”She added that the government would be amenable to saving all footage if the plaintiffs “have endless hard drives that we could save things to, because again we don’t have the resources to do what the court is ordering us to do. But if they have endless hard drives where we could save the information, that might be one solution.”Magistrate Judge Laura McNally said they aren’t being “preserved from now until the end of time, they’re being preserved for now,” and said “I’m guessing the federal government has more resources than the plaintiffs here and, I’ll just leave it at that.” When McNally asked if the footage was gone and not recoverable, Brady said “that’s what I’ve been told.”  “I’ve asked for the name and phone number for the person that is most knowledgeable from the vendor [attempting to recover] the footage, and if I need to depose them to confirm this, I can do this,” she said. “But I have been told that it’s not recoverable, that the system crashed.”Plaintiffs in the case say they are being held in “inhumane” conditions. The complaint describes a facility where detainees are “confined at Broadview inside overcrowded holding cells containing dozens of people at a time. People are forced to attempt to sleep for days or sometimes weeks on plastic chairs or on the filthy concrete floor. They are denied sufficient food and water […] the temperatures are extreme and uncomfortable […] the physical conditions are filthy, with poor sanitation, clogged toilets, and blood, human fluids, and insects in the sinks and the floor […] federal officers who patrol Broadview under Defendants’ authority are abusive and cruel. Putative class members are routinely degraded, mistreated, and humiliated by these officers.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PHP 8.5 Released With New Pipe Operator, New URI Extension &amp; Clone With</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/PHP-8.5-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:19:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PHP 8.5 is out today as the annual major feature release for this popular scripting language...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How POGOs Became a Hub for Organized Crime</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bq3AltIkCz8</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Bq3AltIkCz8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[POGO is short for Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators — online gambling firms based in the Philippines but serving customers abroad, especially in China, where gambling is banned.

Its target audience was homeowners associations and people running gated communities in upscale neighborhoods. The purpose of the cameras (and, eventually, the attached license plate reader tech) was to make sure people who were plenty safe already weren’t annoyed by occasional intrusions by the rest of the world outside of their gates.Then it went the Ring route, offering cheap cameras to cops. It was just inkjet printers all over again. The cameras were affordable. Subscription fees for access to footage and the company’s search engine were the real moneymaker.And, much like Ring, Flock has ended up on the wrong side of public opinion. While it hasn’t quite generated the amount of negative press Ring’s cozy relationship with cop shops has (yet!), it’s been getting eyeballed pretty fiercely by people who aren’t fans of its access-it-all-from-anywhere attitude. A report from 404 Media showed Texas law enforcement officers utilizing the nationwide network of Flock ALPR data to hunt down someone who had engaged in a medication abortion. Weeks later, it was discovered this search was performed on behalf of her vengeful boyfriend, who sought to press criminal charges against her.Other news has surfaced as well, making Flock Safety look even worse. It has placed almost no restrictions on access by anyone from anywhere, which has resulted in a lot of local law enforcement agencies performing searches federal agencies like CBP, US Border Patrol, and ICE can’t perform themselves. In some cases, Flock’s lack of restraint and nonexistent privacy policies has made their cameras pretty much illegal. In other cases, local lawmakers are finally reining in use of this camera network due to its steady abuse by federal officers. Police departments in Redmond and Lynnwood have temporarily shut down their Flock license plate reader systems following growing public concerns about privacy and system access, according to city officials.Redmond’s City Council voted unanimously Monday to turn off its Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) cameras after learning that U.S. Border Patrol improperly accessed Auburn’s Flock system last month.Redmond’s police chief, Darrell Lowe, insists no improper/proxy access has happened on his watch. But that doesn’t mean all that much, because it’s unclear whether or not Flock Safety would inform local cops if these agencies did. For that matter, proxy searches for federal agencies generally have access to any records generated anywhere in the country. So, it’s hardly comforting to assure people your agency hasn’t been approached  by federal officers. That was the point Senator Ron Wyden made in his letter to Flock Safety — one in which he pointed out that Flock has zero desire to deter abuse of its camera network, much less engage in good faith discussions about how it could go about siloing its networks so searches are restricted to areas directly overseen by local law enforcement. The police chief in Lynnwood, however, didn’t try to make excuses. He actually attempted to do something when these concerns were first raised.“Flock cameras have already proven to be an invaluable investigative tool in solving crimes and keeping our community safe,” Lynnwood Police Chief Cole Langdon said. “However, it’s equally important that we maintain the public’s trust.”The ALPR program in Lynnwood launched June 29, 2025, with 25 cameras funded through a Washington Auto Theft Prevention Authority grant.Shortly after implementation, the department learned a vendor-enabled “nationwide search” feature allowed broader access than Lynnwood authorized.Police said they worked with Flock Safety to disable that feature on July 8.Private surveillance vendor Flock Safety reinstalled all of its stationary license plate cameras in Evanston that had previously been removed, apparently doing so without authorization from the city, which sent the company a cease-and-desist order Tuesday afternoon demanding that the cams be taken back down.The city previously  19 automated license plate readers (18 stationary and one flex camera that can be attached to a squad car) provided by the company and put its contract with Flock on a 30-day termination notice on Aug. 26.Predictably, this push-back against Flock is generally occurring in areas already being threatened/invaded on a daily basis by the US military and swarms of federal officers. But that’s to be expected. Those most threatened by federal abuse of local camera networks are always going to be the first to fight back. The reason it’s not happening in “red” states is because the people running those states honestly don’t care what route enables authoritarianism, just so long as it does so while their party still holds power. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: EDU Unlimited by StackSkills</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/daily-deal-edu-unlimited-by-stackskills-5/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 18:48:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[StackSkills is the premier online learning platform for mastering today’s most in-demand skills.

Rather than stirring up partisan controversies, against a backdrop of complacency toward Putin’s Russia, let us respect our soldiers.”The argument in France is the latest example of the difficulties European governments are facing, in convincing people that the war in Ukraine has jolted the continent into a new era.Earlier this week, the German defence minister warned that Russia could be ready to attack a Nato country within three to four years.Western allies have agreed to a massive increase in defence spending –  eventually to five percent by 2035 – but governments fear that that will mean making unpopular cuts elsewhere.“Strengthening our resilience and deterrence requires a whole-of-society approach.”– Admiral Rob Bauer, former Nato officialSpain has outright rejected increasing defence spending. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called it “unreasonable, but also counterproductive” to do so.Society lacks the “strength of spirit to accept suffering in order to protect who we are”, General Mandon warned in his speech yesterday.Military officials fear that politicians and citizens are yet to fully comprehend what modern warfare in Europe could look like.“Strengthening our resilience and deterrence requires a whole-of-society approach in which governments, companies, and citizens take their responsibilities and work together intensively”, former Nato official, Admiral Rob Bauer has urged.The unexplained drones that have ruined holidays for passengers at airports in Belgium, Denmark and Germany in recent months could be the smallest taste of a type of war that is no longer far away on the battlefield, military analysts have suggested.Cut pipelines, cables and Russia’s so-called shadow fleet could be another.Reports of a possible US-Russian peace deal for Ukraine have raised hopes that a wider European conflict could be avoided.“The danger posed by Russia will not end when this war does.”– Mark Rutte, Nato’s Secretary GeneralBut EU leaders are cautious about any agreement being done over their heads.“What we, as Europeans, have always supported is a long, lasting and just peace, and we welcome any efforts to achieve that. Of course, for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board. This is very clear”, said the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas this morning.Nato’s Secretary General Mark Rutte has also warned against assuming that an end to the war in Ukraine would be an end to our problems.“The threats we face are real and lasting”, he said earlier this month.“The danger posed by Russia will not end when this war does…We cannot be naive. We must be prepared.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2415 - Adam Ray</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-MIlZvjpus</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z-MIlZvjpus?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 18:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adam Ray is a comic, actor, and the host of the podcast "About Last Night."

Carr first leaked word of the fake investigation to right wing propaganda website Breitbart.Carr clearly doesn’t regulate UK media organizations. The PBS and NPR never even aired the documentary in question and had nothing do do with the BBC’s edits. So in his letter, Carr has to jump through a bunch of hoops to make his performative effort sound official and coherent:Trump's censor in chief at the FCC, Brendan Carr, just sent a letter to the heads of BBC, NPR and PBS informing them he's launching a "news distortion" probe into the BBC's editing of a documentary on Trump's Jan. 6 activities.Here it is:Tim Karr, Senior Director of consumer group Free Press, told Techdirt that he spoke to the BBC, who  the supposed letter Carr leaked to Breitbart. It’s also not posted to the FCC website. And it takes a few minutes of research to find that PBS and NPR, again, never aired the documentary in question (“Panorama,” which never aired in the U.S. and wasn’t even all that critical of Trump). This is a manufactured scandal. Carr is putting on a cute little show for Trump and right wing media so he can pretend he’s being “tough” on “unfair” “liberal” media outlets. While this is performative grandstanding by a strange, unserious man, it’s still very dangerous for a government official to be abusing FCC authority to try and suppress journalism and free speech.We’ve covered the BBC fracas recently. The short version: a right wing tabloid created a scandal out of the fact that a  BBC documentary edited together two parts of Trump’s January 6 speech encouraging violence at the Capitol. While the snippet does reflect Trump’s clear and obvious intent to incite violence at the Capitol, the edit stitched together two parts of the same speech 54 minutes apart. Still, as we’ve seen with outlets like ABC and CBS, that effort’s been working well so far when it comes to major U.S. media companies, whose affluent, usually Conservative owners are more worried about tax cuts, deregulation, and merger approvals than they are about consistently serving the public interest. It’s far less likely to work on a media organization in another country that isn’t regulated by Brendan Carr. Trump has claimed he’s going to file a $1-$5 billion lawsuit against the BBC for the edit, despite the fact the edits occurred more than a year ago (outside the limits of UK defamation law). The BBC hasn’t helped itself by over-reacting to the fake right wing scandal; with numerous high level BBC employees resigning, and the BBC CEO tripping over himself to apologize. Still, they’ve promised to fight Trump’s lawsuit, and have a very good chance of winning it.Since that lawsuit isn’t likely to go well, Trump had Carr once again abuse FCC authority to launch a fake investigation based on the FCC’s decades-old “news distortion” rule. That rule, created in 1949, was  to be used to police major scandals — like a company or politician bribing a news organization to suppress a story important to the public interest.A bipartisan coalition of former FCC officials just last week wrote a letter to Carr, urging him to eliminate the dated rule and stop abusing FCC power to crush free speech and undermine journalism. Carr, a dutiful MAGA loyalist, unsurprisingly refused, continuing to pretend he’s “serving the public interest”:Unfortunately when the cowed U.S. corporate media covers these obvious attacks on free speech, they tend to soft sell how monumentally full of shit Carr and Trump are on this subject. Which is, of course, the exact outcome Trump and Carr are looking for. The U.S. right wing is openly buying up major social networks (X, TikTok), and what’s left of our broken mainstream media (CBS, CNN), then trying to bully or bribe any stragglers into being pathetic stewards of major online information spaces (Meta), or feckless echoes of serious journalism (ABC). However silly and performative Brendan Carr may be, his party’s mission to own, bully, or destroy all the cornerstones of major media is extremely dangerous. It’s the same gambit authoritarians in countries like Hungary and Russia successfully implemented to successfully cement permanent rule. And while it may improve as Trump’s health and influence fails, most of the U.S. responses to date have been pathetic. With any luck, their hubris and incompetence will be their downfall. But it’s going to necessitate a broader awareness — especially among the Democrat party gerontocracy easily befuddled by the modern information environment — of what’s actually happening and what they’re trying to accomplish. It’s unlikely anything real comes of this inquiry itself. Again, the FCC doesn’t regulate the BBC and NPR and PBS literally had nothing to do with the BBC’s decision. Carr is putting on a cute (but dangerous) show for his mad king and right wing media, wasting taxpayer resources, and trying to scare media organizations away from telling the public the truth about an unpopular, embarrassing administration. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The first Nuremberg trial | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCEX7jV2cx8</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cCEX7jV2cx8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 17:01:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nuremberg trials started 80 years ago and marked a milestone in the establishment of international law. The images of high-ranking Nazis in the dock are seared into our collective memory.

The Nuremberg trials were a series of military tribunals staged by the Allies after World War Two. The first and best-known trial ended in October 1946 with the sentencing to death of 12 high-ranking Nazis.  Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, Hermann Göring, Germany’s foreign minister during the Nazi regime, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Armaments Minister and chief architect Albert Speer, anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher and high-ranking SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner were among those in the dock. The court met for the first time in Nuremberg in November 1945 and was in session for 218 days.
By making the Nazi elite answer for their crimes in this hugely complex trial, the Allies ushered in the era of modern international law. Using photos and archive film material, the documentary reconstructs what went on in the court room, as well as revealing what went on behind the scenes.

We do not intend to do it right now,” she said.“Crippling Ukraine’s defence capabilities is just simply not acceptable.”Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman asked Rudik about reports proposing peace terms that included: Ukraine giving up control of Donbass, giving up weapons capable of reaching Moscow, cutting the size of its army and recognising Russian as an official state language. Rudik said such proposals were unacceptable.“This is just another attempt to put us into capitulation that will be just coming later,” she said.Rudik said Ukraine’s ability to defend itself needed to be protected.Asked about a corruption scandal around President Zelensky, she said the country’s future should not be shaped by it.“Ukraine is not President Zelensky,” she said.Rudik said elections were not possible during the war, but parliament could form a new government. “The whole world is watching if the president will be able to do the right thing,” she said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Don&apos;t brine your Turkey, try marinating it instead!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DtI1YiEHCQ</link><author>Middle Eats</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0DtI1YiEHCQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:38:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWj_rUMGYCP0DjffybE2nbg">Middle Eats</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get the Typhur Sync Dual at its lowest price of the year in the Typhur Black Friday sale.

Recipe designed for a 6-8kg (13-18lb) Turkey. See notes at bottom for adjusting to different weights

Onion marinade
8 onions
6 tbsp salt (** 1 tbsp per kilogram, for 8kg use 8 tbsp)
10 garlic cloves
3 tbsp black pepper
4 tbsp sumac
120ml (1/2 cup) lemon juice
20g (1 inch bundle) thyme 

Compound butter
250g butter
4 lemons (zested)
2 oranges (zested)
1 tbsp salt
2 tsp aleppo pepper flakes
2 tsp black pepper
2 tsp sumac
8 garlic cloves
20g (1 inch bundle) thyme 

Tray
4 lemons (from above step)
2 oranges (from above step)
1-2 onion quartered for turkey cavity
1-2 onions (or 8-10 shallots) sliced for gravy
bundle of sage or thyme

Gravy
250ml (1 cup) melted turkey fat or butter
1 cup all purpose flour (you may need 1-2 tbsp extra)
500ml (2 cups) turkey drippings including shallot/onion pieces
500-1000ml (2-4 cups) stock or water
Salt to taste

Adjusting the recipe for larger birds:
- For a 9-12 kg turkey make 1.5X the marinade, use salt at 1 tbsp per kilogram
- For larger turkeys you may double the marinade, however it is fine to use just 1.5x the marinade, but use the full amount of salt]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EFF Demands Answers About ICE-Spotting App Takedowns</title><link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-demands-answers-about-ice-spotting-app-takedowns</link><author>Hudson Hongo</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/OG-PoliceRecording.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:30:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This is what happens in your brain when you can’t recall a word - Cella Wright</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtovy-1-QUM</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wtovy-1-QUM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into what causes the tip of the tongue phenomenon, where your brain struggles to recall a word or term from memory.

--

You’re sure you know your 3rd grade teacher’s name— it’s like you’re hovering over it in your mind, but it just won’t materialize. Researchers call this tantalizing torment a “tip-of-the-tongue state,” and it’s something everyone experiences. But what’s actually happening when a word’s caught here, and how can you best get it unstuck? Cella Wright explores why your brain can struggle with recall.

Creators Say That&apos;s a Terrible Idea</title><link>https://www.404media.co/onlyfans-background-checks-criminal-records-checkr/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/leire-cavia-w5rIbhD3104-unsplash-1.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:45:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OnlyFans will start running background checks on people signing up as content creators, the platform’s CEO recently announced. As reported by adult industry news outlet , OnlyFans CEO Keily Blair announced the partnership in a LinkedIn post. Blair doesn’t say in the post when the checks will be implemented, whether all types of criminal convictions will bar creators from signing up, if existing creators will be checked as well, or what countries’ criminal records will be checked. OnlyFans did not respond to 404 Media's request for comment. “I am very proud to add our partnership with Checkr Trust to our onboarding process in the US,” Blair wrote. “Checkr, Inc. helps OnlyFans to prevent people who have a criminal conviction which may impact on our community's safety from signing up as a Creator on OnlyFans. It’s collaborations like this that make the real difference behind the scenes and keep OnlyFans a space where creators and fans feel secure and empowered.”  Many OnlyFans creators turned to the platform, and to online sex work more generally, when they’re not able to obtain employment at traditional workplaces. Some sex workers doing in-person work turned to online sex work as a way to make ends meet—especially after the passage of the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in 2018 made it much more difficult to screen clients for escorting. And in-person sex work is still criminalized in the U.S. and many other countries. “Criminal background checks will not stop potential predators from using the platform (OF), it will only harm individuals who are already at higher risk. Sex work has always had a low barrier to entry, making it the most accessible career for people from all walks of life,” performer , who’s on OnlyFans and other platforms, told me in an email. “Removing creators with criminal/arrest records will only push more vulnerable people (overwhelmingly, women) to street based/survival sex work. Adding more barriers to what is arguably the safest form of sex work (online sex work) will push sex industry workers to less and less safe options.” Jessica Starling, who also creates adult content on OnlyFans, told me in a call that their first thought was that if someone using OnlyFans has a prostitution charge, they might not be able to use the platform. “If they're trying to transition to online work, they won’t be able to do that anymore,” they said. “And the second thing I thought was that it's just invasive and overreaching... And then I looked up the company, and I'm like, ‘Oh, wow, this is really bad.’”Checkr is  by Uber, Instacart, Shipt, Postmates, and Lyft, and lists many more companies like Dominos and Doordash on its site as clients. The company has been sued  for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other consumer credit complaints. The Fair Credit Reporting Act says that companies providing information to consumer reporting agencies are legally obligated to investigate disputed information. And a lot of people dispute the information Checkr and Inflection provide on them, claiming mixed-up names, acquittals, and decades-old misdemeanors or traffic tickets prevented them from accessing platforms that use background checking services.  Checkr regularly acquires other background checking and age verification companies, and acquired a background check company called Inflection in 2022. At the time, I found more than a dozen lawsuits against Inflection alone in a three year span, many of them from people who found out about the allegedly inaccurate reports Inflection kept about them after being banned from Airbnb after the company claimed they failed checks. “Sex workers face discrimination when leaving the sex trade, especially those who have been face-out and are identifiable in the online world. Facial recognition technology has advanced to a point where just about anyone can ascertain your identity from a single picture,” Alex said. “Leaving the online sex trade is not as easy as it once was, and anything you've done online will follow you for a lifetime. Creators who are forced to leave the platform will find that safe and stable alternatives are far and few between.”Last month, Pornhub announced that it would start performing background checks on existing content partners—which primarily include studios—next year. "To further protect our creators and users, all new applicants must now complete a criminal background check during onboarding," the platform announced in a newsletter to partners, . Alex said she believes background checks in the porn industry could be beneficial, under very specific circumstances. “I do not think that someone with egregious history of sexual violence should be allowed to work in the sex trade in any capacity—similarly, a person convicted of hurting children should be not able to work with children—so if the criminal record checks were searching specifically for sex based offences I could see the benefit, but that doesn't appear to be the case (to my knowledge). What's to stop OnlyFans from deactivating someone's account due to a shoplifting offense?” she said. “I'd like to know more about what they're searching for with these background checks.”Even with third-party companies like Checkr doing the work, as is the case with third-party age verification that’s swept the U.S. and targeted the porn industry, increased data means increased risk of it being leaked or hacked. Last year, a background check company called National Public Data claimed it was breached by hackers who got the confidential data of 2.9 billion people. The unencrypted data was then sold on the dark web.“It’s dangerous for anyone, but it's especially dangerous for us [adult creators] because we're more vulnerable anyway. Especially when you're online, you're hypervisible,” Starling said. “It doesn't protect anyone except OnlyFans themselves, the company.” OnlyFans became the household name in independent porn because of the work of its adult content creators. Starling mentioned that because the platform has dominated the market, it’s difficult to just go to another platform if creators don’t want to be subjected to background checks. “We're put in a position where we have very limited power," they said. "So when a platform decides to do something like this, we’re kind of screwed, right?” Earlier this year, OnlyFans owner Fenix International Ltd  to sell the company to an investor group at a valuation of around $8 billion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine Is Jamming Russia’s ‘Superweapon’ With a Song</title><link>https://www.404media.co/ukraine-is-jamming-russias-superweapon-with-a-song/</link><author>Matthew Gault</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/5024110419372456511.jpg.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:11:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ukrainian Army is knocking a once-hyped Russian  out of the sky by jamming it with a song and tricking it into thinking it’s in Lima, Peru. The Kremlin once called its Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missiles .” Joe Biden  “almost impossible to stop.” Now Ukrainian electronic warfare experts say they can counter the Kinzhal with some music and a re-direction order.“Only one type of system in Ukraine was able to intercept those kinds of missiles. It was the Patriot system, which the United States provided to Ukraine. But, because of the limits of those systems and the shortage of ammunition, Ukraine defense are unable to intercept most of those Kijnhals,” a member of Night Watch—a Ukrainian electronic warfare team—told 404 Media. The representative from Night Watch spoke to me on the condition of anonymity to discuss war tactics.Kinzhals and other guided munitions navigate by communicating with Russian satellites that are part of the GLONASS system, a GPS-style navigation network. Night Watch uses a jamming system called Lima EW to generate a disruption field that prevents anything in the area from communicating with a satellite. Many traditional jamming systems work by blasting receivers on munitions and aircraft with radio noise. Lima does that, but also sends along a digital signal and spoofs navigation signals. It “hacks” the receiver it's communicating with to throw it off course.Night Watch shared pictures of the downed Kinzhals with 404 Media that showed a missile with a controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA), an active antenna that’s meant to resist jamming and spoofing. “We discovered that this missile had pretty old type of technology,” Night Watch said. “They had the same type of receivers as old Soviet missiles used to have. So there is nothing special, there is nothing new in those types of missiles.”Night Watch told 404 Media that it used this Lima to take down 19 Kinzhals in the past two weeks. First, it replaces the missile’s satellite navigation signals with the Ukrainian song Any digital noise or random signal would work to jam the navigation system, but Night Watch wanted to use the song because they think it’s funny. “We just send a song…we just make it into binary code, you know, like 010101, and just send it to the Russian navigation system,” Night Watch said. “It’s just kind of a joke. [Bandera] is a Ukrainian nationalist and Russia tries to use this person in their propaganda to say all Ukrainians are Nazis. They always try to scare the Russian people that Ukrainians are, culturally, all the same as Bandera.”Do you know anything else about this story? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +1 347 762-9212 or send me an email at matthew@404media.co.Once the song hits, Night Watch uses Lima to spoof a navigation signal to the missiles and make them think they’re in Lima, Peru. Once the missile’s confused about its location, it attempts to change direction. These missiles are fast—launched from a MiG-31 they can hit speeds of up to Mach 5.7 or more than 4,000 miles per hour—and an object moving that fast doesn’t fare well with sudden changes of direction.“The airframe cannot withstand the excessive stress and the missile naturally fails,” Night Watch said. “When the Kinzhal missile tried to quickly change navigation, the fuselage of this missile was unable to handle the speed…and, yeah., it was just cut into two parts…the biggest advantage of those missiles, speed, was used against them. So that’s why we have intercepted 19 missiles for the last two weeks.”Night Watch told 404 Media that Russia is attempting to defeat the Lima system by loading the missiles with more of the old tech. The goal seems to be to use the different receivers to hop frequencies and avoid Lima’s signal. “What is Russia trying to do? Increase the amount of receivers on those missiles. They used to have eight receivers and right now they increase it up to 12, but it will not help,” Night Watch said. “The last one we intercepted, they already used 16 receivers. It’s pretty useless, that type of modification.” According to Night Watch, countering Lima by increasing the number of receivers on the missile is a profound misunderstanding of its tech. “They think we make the attack on each receiver and as soon as one receiver attacks, they try to swap in another receiver and get a signal from another satellite. But when the missile enters the range of our system, we cover all types of receivers,” they said. “It’s physically impossible to connect with another satellite, but they think that it’s possible. That’s why they started with four receivers and right now it’s 16. I guess in the future we’ll see 24, but it’s pretty useless.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discover an ancient world drowned when sea levels rose 😱 #LostCitiesWithAlbertLin</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/s0stm9U0cyw</link><author>National Geographic</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/s0stm9U0cyw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:01:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVm7bg6pXKo1Pr6k5kxG9A">National Geographic</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At first glance, it’s just another stretch of sea.

Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show—a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time. 

A leather-clad Alexander Skarsgård is riding into this week’s Take as our very special guest. That’s because he’s here to talk about ‘Pillion’, the one-of-a-kind comedy drama where he stars as mysterious BDSM biker Ray. The film follows his unfolding relationship with Colin, a shy small-town boy played by Harry Melling—who you might have heard on the show a few months back chatting to Simon about ‘Harvest’. Colin begins to discover his submissive streak under Ray’s dominant hand, as their complex relationship develops. Alexander sits down with Simon to unpack the film—a ‘Dom-Com’, as he calls it—and gives us the lowdown on what a Skarsgård Christmas looks like too.  

Don’s miss Mark’s review of ‘Pillion’ on next week’s show. This week we’ve got his verdicts on three more juicy new releases for you as usual. First up, ‘Sisu: Road to Revenge’--the Finnish action sequel to 2022’s ‘Sisu’, where seemingly unkillable action man Aatami Korpi goes on a revenge rampage against the Red Army. Plus, Bizarre biblical horror ‘The Carpenter’s Son’, starring Nicolas Cage going full Nicola Cage yet again—and ‘Wicked: For Good’ – the sequel to last year’s musical smash spectacle.  

The Good Doctors run down the box office top 10 too—and from the top of the charts to the bottom of the barrel, there’s the Laughter Lift. Plus your excellent and erudite correspondence answered.

Nobody knows for sure just how they made it all the way to Germany, but it’s possible they were brought to Europe by Canadian soldiers stationed in Karlsruhe, where they began spreading non-stop.  

They started off in ponds and small bodies of water in South-Western Germany. But now, 30 years after they first got here, they’ve been spotted hundreds of kilometers upriver. They can’t really outcompete larger predators, but in places with little competition, they’ve been hard to stop. Crayfish reproduce incredibly fast – a single female cay lay hundreds of eggs, leaving locals, scientists and conservationists scrambling for ways to stop its quick spread and preserve their local ecosystems.

The only one that was even willing to give a statement, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, didn’t really say anything useful:““Congress is still waiting to get briefed on how the TikTok sale would actually stop Chinese algorithms from causing harm to U.S. citizens, U.S. military, and U.S. interests,” she said. “The lack of transparency has caused concerns for both Democrats and Republicans who are still waiting for secure briefings on how to stop malign actions.”You might recall that Biden championed the ban, then refused to enforce it on his way out the door. Trump followed this up by promising to fix everything with a deal in 75 days, then extended that deadline when China predictably balked. Repeatedly. Last September, Trump finally announced that he’d struck a deal with ByteDance to offload 45 percent of the app to Oracle (Trump’s friend Larry Ellison), Silver Lake (Michael Dell is a top investor), and Abu Dhabi’s MGX — as well as possibly Rupert Murdoch.It’s kind of the worst of all possible outcomes. The deal maintains the app’s supposedly problematic connections to China, but it adds a layer of domestic corruption as Trump offloads control of the app to his billionaire buddies. Including Larry Ellison, who (with the help of his nepobaby son David) is clearly making a play to dominate whatever’s left of establishment U.S. media. It remains unclear if China actually supports — and will allow — such a deal. Trump has implied that President Xi Jinping has given approval, but there’s been little public forward momentum despite a meeting between Trump and Xi in both June and late October. And even then, it’s not clear such a deal would be aligned with the law, notes The Verge:“Even if China accepts the deal, it’s not clear the agreement meets the legal requirements for divestiture. Licensing the TikTok algorithm could potentially constitute an ongoing operational relationship between the US entity and ByteDance, which is explicitly barred by the law.”I’ve noted more times than I can count that the push to ban TikTok was never really about protecting American privacy. If that were true, we would pass a real privacy law and craft serious penalties for companies and executives that play fast and loose with sensitive American data, be it TikTok or the myriad of super dodgy apps, telecoms, and hardware vendors monetizing your phone usage.It was never really about propaganda. If that were true, we’d take aim at the extremely well funded authoritarian propaganda machine and engage in content moderation of race-baiting political propaganda that’s filling the brains of young American men with pudding and hate. We’d push for media consolidation limits and education media literacy reforms common in countries like Finland.Now all of the folks who were so breathless about the need for a ban — from Brendan Carr to large cross sections of Congress — are suddenly all weirdly mute as the proposal sits in policy limbo somewhere between Trump’s rank corruption and raw, blistering congressional incompetence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Should salmon farming be our future? #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YP_1UtPca1g</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YP_1UtPca1g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is it possible to eat meat and still care about this planet?

DESCRIPTION
Matt Godbolt, creator of Compiler Explorer, interviews Daniel Kusswurm, author of "Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming", about the enduring relevance of assembly language in modern software development. They explore what SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is and why it enables dramatic performance improvements for specific computational tasks, discuss when assembly language programming is justified versus using compiler intrinsics, and examine the challenges of writing vectorized algorithms. Dan shares insights from his career optimizing image analysis software and explains how understanding low-level architecture can improve code quality even when writing in higher-level languages.

Sometimes fans set those servers up simply because they can do it better and more securely than the publisher… and then the publisher takes them down because of intellectual property concerns. Sometimes gamers simply want to play an older version of an online game, before the publisher pushes out a bunch of updates and expansion packs… and the publisher takes them down because of intellectual property concerns. And, rarely, sometimes the publisher ends its official support and hosting of a game’s servers and actually acts human and cool by giving fans a cheap license to host their own servers to keep the game alive.The most frustrating version of this sort of thing is when a publisher fully ends support for a game, shuts down its servers, and  prevents any and all fans from ever playing the game again over IP concerns. And there can be no more stark example of this than , an online game that Sony shut down 2 weeks (!!!) after its release, over a year ago.A group of dedicated coders has managed to partially revive online gameplay for the PC version of Concord, the team-based shooter that Sony famously shut down just two weeks after its launch last summer. Now, though, the team behind that fan server effort is closing off new access after Sony started issuing DMCA takedown requests of sample gameplay videos.The Game Post was among the first to publicize the “Concord Delta” project, which reverse-engineered the game’s now-defunct server API to get a functional multiplayer match running over the weekend. “The project is still [a work in progress], it’s playable, but buggy,” developer Red posted in the game’s Discord channel, as reported by The Game Post. “Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting.”Those DMCA takedowns came from MarkScan, a longtime partner of Sony that looks around the internet for anything remotely resembling IP infractions and fires off DMCA notices. No demands about the actual game servers have been made… yet. And that makes this all the more strange. MarkScan, presumably at the behest of Sony, is taking down gameplay videos for a game that simply doesn’t exist outside of this fan effort. There are a billion gameplay videos of Sony games that are actually active and out in the world, but these get taken down?And, again, it’s the absurdity that is the real star here.  officially existed for 2 whole weeks in 2024. Sony shut it down and refunded the money of any buyer that wanted one. It shut down the studio that made the game. So when some actual fans of the game come along and want to revive it on their own, Sony starts issuing threats?“We’re choosing to not make this game available and insist  don’t either.”While the team behind Concord Delta hasn’t been contacted by Sony directly, the YouTube video takedowns have put the group in something of a defensive crouch. “Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites [to our Discord server] for the time being,” Red wrote on the Discord, as reported by The Game Post.Of course, Sony could also decide to simply look the other way and let players enjoy a game the company seems to have no interest in officially supporting. That’s what Nintendo appears to be doing with fan projects like The Pretendo Network and WiiLink, which restore online functionality that’s no longer officially available on classic Nintendo consoles.When you manage to make Nintendo look relatively fan-friendly, it should be obvious you’ve done something horribly wrong.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Spanish Armada</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-spanish-armada</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/691b52167cf1b7ec4571841e/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=K6BO0n4yF8xbXW3FoFp0cfGBQjBXX7br1Tko69EdOCU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1588, Spain’s mighty armada sailed to invade England and change the balance of power in Europe.

versions instead of the previous default, which re-used C++'s mangling
scheme, starting in When Rust is compiled into object files and binaries, each item (functions,
statics, etc) must have a globally unique  "symbol" identifying it.In C, the symbol name of a function is just the name that the function was
defined with, such as . This is straightforward and easy to
understand, but requires that each item have a globally unique name
that doesn't overlap with any symbols from libraries that it is linked
against. If two items had the same symbol then when the linker tried to resolve
a symbol to an address in memory (of a function, say), then it wouldn't know
which symbol is the correct one.Languages like Rust and C++ define "symbol mangling schemes", leveraging information
from the type system to give each item a unique symbol name. Without this, it would be
possible to produce clashing symbols in a variety of ways - for example, every
instantiation of a generic or templated function (or an overload in C++), which all
have the same name in the surface language would end up with clashing symbols; or
the same name in different modules, such as  and  would have clashing
symbols.Rust originally used a symbol mangling scheme based on the
Itanium ABI's name mangling scheme used by C++ (sometimes). Over
the years, it was extended in an inconsistent and ad-hoc way to support Rust
features that the mangling scheme wasn't originally designed for. Rust's current legacy
mangling scheme has a number of drawbacks:Information about generic parameter instantiations is lost during manglingIt is internally inconsistent - some paths use an Itanium ABI-style encoding
but some don'tSymbol names can contain  characters which aren't supported on all platformsSymbol names include an opaque hash which depends on compiler internals and
can't be easily replicated by other compilers or toolsThere is no straightforward way to differentiate between Rust and C++ symbolsIf you've ever tried to use Rust with a debugger or a profiler and found it hard
to work with because you couldn't work out which functions were which, it's probably
because information was being lost in the mangling scheme.Rust's compiler team started working on our own mangling scheme back in 2018
with RFC 2603 (see the "v0 Symbol Format" chapter in
rustc book for our current documentation on the format). Our "v0" mangling scheme has
multiple advantageous properties:An unambiguous encoding for everything that can end up in a binary's symbol tableInformation about generic parameters are encoded in a reversible wayMangled symbols are decodable such that it should be possible to identify concrete
instances of generic functionsIt doesn't rely on compiler internalsSymbols are restricted to only , ,  and , helping ensure
compatibility with tools on varied platformsIt tries to stay efficient and avoid unnecessarily long names and
computationally-expensive decodingHowever, rustc is not the only tool that interacts with Rust symbol names: the
aforementioned debuggers, profilers and other tools all need to be updated to
understand Rust's v0 symbol mangling scheme so that Rust's users can continue
to work with Rust binaries using all the tools they're used to without having
to look at mangled symbols. Furthermore, all of those tools need to have new
releases cut and then those releases need to be picked up by distros. This takes
time!Fortunately, the compiler team now believe that support for our v0 mangling
scheme is now sufficiently widespread that it can start to be used by default by
rustc.Reading Rust backtraces, or using Rust with debuggers, profilers and other
tools that operate on compiled Rust code, will be able to output much more
useful and readable names. This will especially help with async code,
closures and generic functions.It's easy to see the new mangling scheme in action, consider the following
example:With the legacy mangling scheme, all of the useful information about the generic
instantiation of  is lost in the symbol ....but with the v0 mangling scheme, the useful details of the generic instantiation
are preserved with  f::foo::<alloc::vec::Vec<(alloc::string::String, &[u8; 123])>>:Symbols using the v0 mangling scheme can be larger than symbols with the
legacy mangling scheme, which can result in a slight increase in linking
times and binary sizes if symbols aren't stripped (which they aren't by default).
Fortunately this impact should be minor, especially with modern linkers like
lld, which Rust will now default to on some targets.Some old versions of tools/distros or niche tools that the compiler team are
unaware of may not have had support for the v0 mangling scheme added. When
using these tools, the only consequence is that users may encounter mangled
symbols. rustfilt can be used to demangle Rust symbols if a tool does not.In any case, using the new mangling scheme can be disabled if any problem
occurs: use the -Csymbol-mangling-version=legacy -Zunstable-options flag
to revert to using the legacy mangling scheme.Explicitly enabling the legacy mangling scheme requires nightly, it is not
intended to be stabilised so that support can eventually be removed.If you maintain a tool that interacts with Rust symbols and does not
support the v0 mangling scheme, there are Rust and C implementations
of a v0 symbol demangler available in the rust-lang/rustc-demangle
repository that can be integrated into your project.rustc will use our "v0" mangling scheme on nightly for all targets
starting in tomorrow's rustup nightly ().If that happens, you can use the legacy mangling scheme with
the -Csymbol-mangling-version=legacy -Zunstable-options flag.
Either by adding it to the usual  environment variable, or to a
project's  configuration file, like so:If you like the sound of the new symbol mangling version and would
like to start using it on stable or beta channels of Rust, then you can
similarly use the -Csymbol-mangling-version=v0 flag today via

But Colorado-style pizza? Probably not. And there’s a perfectly ridiculous reason why this regional style never spread beyond a handful of restaurants in the Rocky Mountains: one guy trademarked it and scared everyone else away from making it.This story comes via a fascinating Sporkful podcast episode where reporter Paul Karolyi spent years investigating why Colorado-style pizza remains trapped in obscurity while other regional styles became national phenomena.The whole episode is worth listening to for the detective work alone, but the trademark angle reveals something important about how intellectual property thinking can strangle cultural movements in their cradle.Here’s the thing about pizza “styles”: they become styles precisely because they spread. New York, Chicago, Detroit, New Haven—these aren’t just individual restaurant concepts, they’re cultural phenomena adopted and adapted by hundreds of restaurants. That widespread adoption creates the network effects that make a “style” valuable: customers seek it out, restaurants compete to perfect it, food writers chronicle its evolution.Colorado-style pizza never got that chance. When Karolyi dug into why, he discovered that Beau Jo’s—the restaurant credited with inventing the style—had locked it up legally. When he asked the owner’s daughter if other restaurants were making Colorado-style pizza, her response was telling:We’re um a trademark, so they cannot.Beau owns a trademark for Colorado style pizza.When Karolyi finally tracked down the actual owner, Chip (after years of trying, which is its own fascinating subplot), he expected to hear about some grand strategic vision behind the trademark. Instead, he got a masterclass in reflexive IP hoarding:Cuz it’s different and nobody else is doing that. So, why not do it Colorado style? I mean, there’s Chicago style and there’s Pittsburgh style and Detroit and everything else. Um, and we were doing something that was what was definitely different and um um licensing attorney said, “Yeah, we can do it” and we were able to.That’s it. No business plan. No licensing strategy. Just “some lawyer said we can do it” so they did. This is the IP-industrial complex in microcosm: lawyers selling trademark applications because they can, not because they should.I pressed my case to Chip that abandoning the trademark so others could also use it could actually be good for his business.“If more places made Colorado style pizza, the style itself would become more famous, which would make more people come to Beau Jo’s to try the original. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, like everyone would know that Beau Jo was the originator. Like, do you ever worry or maybe do you think that the trademark has possibly hindered the spread of this style of pizza that you created that you should be getting credit for?”“Never thought about it.”“Well, what do you think about it now?”“I don’t know. I have to think about that. It’s an interesting thought. I’ve never thought about it. I’m going to look into it. I’m going to look into it. I’m going to talk to some people and um I’m not totally opposed to it. I don’t know that it would be a good idea for us, but I’m willing to look at it.”A few weeks later, Karolyi followed up with Chip. Predictably, the business advisors had circled the wagons. They “unanimously” told him not to give up the trademark—because of course they did. These are the same people who profit from maintaining artificial scarcity, even when it demonstrably hurts the very thing they’re supposedly protecting.And so Colorado-style pizza remains trapped in its legal cage, known only to a handful of tourists who stumble across Beau Jo’s locations. A culinary innovation that could have sparked a movement instead became a cautionary tale about how IP maximalism kills the things it claims to protect.This case perfectly illustrates the perverse incentives of modern IP thinking. We’ve created an entire industry of lawyers and consultants whose job is to convince business owners to “protect everything” on the off chance they might license it later. Never mind that this protection often destroys the very value they’re trying to capture.The trademark didn’t just fail to help Beau Jo’s—it actively harmed them. As Karolyi documents in the podcast, the legal lockup has demonstrably scared off other restaurateurs from experimenting with Colorado-style pizza, ensuring the “style” remains a curiosity rather than a movement. Fewer competitors means less innovation, less media attention, and fewer customers seeking out “the original.” It’s a masterclass in how to turn potential network effects into network defects.Compare this to the sriracha success story. David Tran of Huy Fong Foods deliberately avoided trademarking “sriracha” early on, allowing dozens of competitors to enter the market. The result? Sriracha became a cultural phenomenon, and Huy Fong’s distinctive rooster bottle became the most recognizable brand in a category they helped create. Even as IP lawyers kept circling, Tran understood what Chip apparently doesn’t:“Everyone wants to jump in now,” said Tran, 70. “We have lawyers come and say ‘I can represent you and sue’ and I say ‘No. Let them do it.’” Tran is so proud of the condiment’s popularity that he maintains a daily ritual of searching the Internet for the latest Sriracha spinoff.Sometimes the best way to protect your creation is to let it go. But decades of IP maximalist indoctrination have made this counterintuitive wisdom almost impossible to hear. Even when presented with a clear roadmap for how abandoning the trademark could grow his business, Chip couldn’t break free from the sunk-cost fallacy and his advisors’ self-interested counsel.The real tragedy isn’t just that Colorado-style pizza remains obscure. It’s that this story plays out thousands of times across industries, with creators choosing artificial scarcity over organic growth, protection over proliferation. Every time someone trademarks a taco style or patents an obvious business method, they’re making the same mistake Chip made: confusing ownership with value creation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reclaiming Water for an Increasingly Thirsty World | An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Xb1WQC7c8</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k_Xb1WQC7c8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 23:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode, we examine water, the essential resource that sustains life on Earth.

Copyright serves a similar purpose today, even though, thanks to the miracle of perfect, zero-cost digital copies, it is possible simultaneously to take an ebook home and yet leave the original behind. For a quarter of a century, the open access movement has been fighting to break those virtual chains for academic works, and to allow anyone freely to read and make copies of the knowledge contained in online virtual libraries.The detailed history of the movement can be found in Chapter 3 of Walled Culture the book (free digital versions available). As the timeline there, and posts on this blog both make clear, the open access movement has made only limited progress despite the enormous effort expended by many dedicated individuals. Moreover the open access idea has been embraced and then subverted by the academic publishers whose greed and selfishness it was meant to fight.One version of open access, known as the “diamond” variant, still offers hope that the goals of free access to knowledge for everyone could still be achieved. But even this minimalist approach to academic publishing requires funding, which raises questions about its long-term sustainability. Economic issues also lie at the heart of wider discussions about what could replace copyright, which was born in the analogue world, and whose dysfunctional nature in the digital environment is evident every day.Walled Culture the book concludes with a look at perhaps the most promising alternative model, whereby “true fans” support directly the creators whose work they value. This approach can also be applied to open access. In this case, the “true fans” of the research work published in papers and books are the academic libraries, acting on behalf of the people who use them. There are various ways for them to support the journals their academics want to access, but one of the most promising is “subscribe to open” (S2O), which helps publishers convert traditional journals into open access. The idea was formalized by Raym Crow, Richard Gallagher, Kamran Naim in 2019. Here’s their explanation of how it works:S2O offers a journal’s current subscribers continued access at a discount off the regular subscription price. If current subscribers participate in the S2O offer, the publisher opens the content covered by that year’s subscription. If participation is not sufficient – for example, if some subscribers delay renewing in the expectation that they can gain access without participating – then the content remains gated. Because the publisher does not guarantee that the content will be opened unless all subscribers participate in the offer, institutions that value access to the content – demonstrably, the journal’s current subscribers – must either subscribe conventionally (at full price) or participate in S2O (at a discount) to ensure continued access. The offer is repeated every year, with the opening of each year’s content contingent on sufficient participation.As with the “true fans” model, supporting S2O journals is in the self-interest of libraries, which receive subscriptions to journals their academics want, and for a lower price. But there is a collateral benefit for society because everyone else also receives access to the knowledge contained in those titles. Publishers receive a guaranteed subscription income up front, and as a consequence of the open access route, they can also reach a larger audience. For example, when the Annual Review of Public Health publication tried out the S2O model, its monthly usage factor went up by a factor of eight. Since that successful trial, the S2O model has gone from strength to strength, as a review article published at the end of last year explains:In August, the prestigious Royal Society announced that it would be moving eight of its subscription journals to S2O. Among those titles is Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the world’s longest-running scientific journal. In an article reflecting on that move, Rod Cookson, publishing director of The Royal Society, explained why he and other forward-thinking publishers are fans of S2O:It is cost neutral and a relatively small change through which libraries can enable entire journals to become open access. This combination of simplicity and transparency has generated enthusiasm for S2O among librarians the world over. Publishers now need to demonstrate to those librarians that in addition to being aligned with their missions, S2O delivers a return on investment that justifies their expenditure. With sensible features that make the S2O proposition work well for both libraries and publishing houses—like multi-year agreements, “premium benefits” for S2O supporters, and collective sales packages—S2O will continue to grow as a trusted and durable model for delivering open access.S2O represents a successful application of the true fans idea in the context of academic publishing. But perhaps supporters of open access should embrace even more of the true fan spirit and look to the example of fan fiction to help re-imagine scholarly publishing. That, at least, is the bold idea of Caroline Ball, who is the community engagement lead for the Open Book Collective, and whose advocacy work appeared in Walled Culture four years ago. Here’s why she thinks academic research should be more like fan fiction:At first glance, fanfiction—non-commercial works created by fans who reimagine and remix existing stories, characters, and worlds—and academic research may seem worlds apart. But look closer, and both are practices of deep engagement, intertextual interpretation, and knowledge creation.Fanfiction doesn’t just regurgitate stories; it interrogates, reinvents, and expands on them, often filling in gaps and exclusions left offscreen. Likewise, scholarship builds on prior work, challenges assumptions, and contributes new insights. Both are iterative, dialogic, and community based. And both, at their best, come from a place of passion and curiosity.Her post explains how Archive of Our Own (AO3), a community-run digital repository for fan fiction, works, and why it could be a model for a new kind of open access:Archive of Our Own (AO3) is a community-run digital repository for fanfiction. Launched in 2008 by the nonprofit Organization for Transformative Works (OTW), AO3 is entirely open access. It charges nothing to publish, nothing to read, and is powered by open-source code and volunteer labor. As of May 2025 (according to the OTW Communications Committee), it hosts over 15 million works across 71,880 fandoms and sees a daily average of 94 million hits.Ball goes on to suggests ways in which scholarly publishing could learn from that evident success. Specific areas include AO3’s flexible metadata system; its innovative approach to reviews and comments; its “format agnosticism”, accepting any kind of contribution; and the way it re-imagines recognition and reputation. In summary, she writes:AO3 reminds us that platforms can be built by and for communities, without extractive profit models or exclusionary hierarchies. It shows what’s possible when infrastructure is treated as a public good, and when participation is scaffolded, not gated. And crucially, AO3 demonstrates how practices that have been piloted in isolation across the scholarly landscape—open peer commentary, volunteer governance, flexible metadata, inclusive formats—can be woven together into a single, sustainable system.The S2O model described above is a welcome addition to the ways in which sustainable open access can be brought in by publishers. But ultimately Ball is right in emphasizing that universal and unconstrained access to knowledge will only be achieved when the entire scholarly publishing system is re-invented with that goal in mind. It’s well past time for all the fans of open access to unite in this endeavor, and to do away with today’s digital chained libraries forever.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Massive Cloudflare outage was triggered by file that suddenly doubled in size</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/cloudflare-broke-much-of-the-internet-with-a-corrupted-bot-management-file/</link><author>Jon Brodkin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cloudflare-error-1152x648-1763584433.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:25:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When a Cloudflare outage disrupted large numbers of websites and online services yesterday, the company initially thought it was hit by a “hyper-scale” DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack.“I worry this is the big botnet flexing,” Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince wrote in an internal chat room yesterday, while he and others discussed whether Cloudflare was being hit by attacks from the prolific Aisuru botnet.

Sentient suffering is a hard problem for theists to solve. The ‘free will defense,’ that privileges and blames human choice, claims to cover moral evil. But what about natural evil, such as animals being killed or eaten alive continuously during the process of evolution before humans? Shouldn’t egregious and relentless animal suffering count against God?

The Dark Ages. A period of collapse, chaos and violence. Or was it? New discoveries are helping to challenge that idea.

After centuries buried beneath the soil, the graves of Anglo-Saxons are unlocking the secrets of these elusive people, revealing a civilisation far more complex than history often remembers.

Today medieval historian Matt Lewis returns to The University of Bradford to team up with Osteoarchaeologist Dr. Jo Buckberry to investigate the remains of three individuals who lived and died in Anglo-Saxon England and who, in death, may help reveal the truth about life in early medieval Britain

Similar footage aired the morning of Trump’s remarks. The president went on to announce Sept. 27 on Truth Social that he would send troops, saying that he was “authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”He later said he’d told Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, that “unless they’re playing false tapes, this looked like World War II. Your place is burning down.”ProPublica examined months of Fox News’ coverage and reviewed more than 700 video clips posted to social media by protesters, counterprotesters and others in the three months preceding the Sept. 4 broadcast.The review found that the news network repeatedly provided a misleading picture of what was happening in Portland.As The Guardian and The Oregonian/OregonLive have reported, Fox News on Sept. 4 used footage from the 2020 protests after the police killing of George Floyd and said it was from 2025. We found two clear cases from that night as well as one that seemed to match a scene filmed at a key site of the 2020 protests. Fox also mislabeled two other dates of actions shown on screen, and one broadcast implied that a protest from elsewhere was happening in Portland.Fox News chyrons about Portland the week of Trump’s remarks carried phrases like “violent demonstrators,” “protesters riot,” “anti-I.C.E. Portland rioters” and “war-like protests.” One host said protesters were attacking federal officers.This portrayal of protesters as routinely instigating violence or rioting was also misleading.As ProPublica reported last week, most clashes between protesters and police before the Fox News segment did not result in any criminal charges or arrests alleging protesters committed violence. What’s more, based on news releases from federal and local authorities, charges and arrests for assault, arson or destruction of property were almost entirely confined to a period that ended the night of July 4.Videos after that date captured numerous images of federal officers forcefully moving in on protesters without corresponding criminal charges alleging protester violence.A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.The Department of Homeland Security did not answer requests to comment on its officers’ tactics.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said of action on the ground in Portland: “This isn’t a peaceful protest that’s under control, like many on the left have claimed, it’s radical violence. President Trump is taking lawful action to protect federal law enforcement officers and address the out-of-control violence that local residents have complained about and Democrat leaders have failed to stop.”Here’s how Fox News’ coverage of the Portland story was misleading.Fox News Said It Was 2025. It Wasn’t.Protests in 2020 in the wake of Floyd’s murder by a police officer attracted large, sometimes violent crowds to Portland — along with a federal law enforcement response authorized by Trump.The protests outside the ICE facility have typically been far smaller. Still, Fox spliced footage from 2020 into its coverage this year and claimed it was from 2025.The Fox News correspondent in the segment that aired the night Trump was watching TV said: “On this night in late June, police used tear gas.”A Sept. 4 Fox News segment aired footage from 2020. Video by Joanna Shan/ProPublicaThe accompanying image appears to be not from the ICE building but from the federal courthouse in downtown Portland, more than a mile away. A nearly identical scene was shown in a Fox News video five years earlier. Footage that aired Sept. 4, shot at a slightly different angle, blurs out spots where graffiti was visible on the building in Fox’s July 2020 broadcast.Almost immediately after showing the courthouse scene, the segment cuts to another image as the correspondent says, “federal police used tear gas and flashbangs.”On screen at that moment is a U.S. Navy veteran who was pepper-sprayed and repeatedly struck with a baton. But it didn’t happen in September 2025. The video was posted on social media on July 18, 2020.A Sept. 4 Fox News segment aired a clip originally posted to X on July 16, 2020. Video by Joanna Shan/ProPublicaThe Fox News segment about the ICE protests soon shows an American flag burning.That image was posted on social media July 16, 2020.The location: the base of a downtown Portland statue more than a mile away from the ICE building where protests are happening in 2025.After mislabeling 2020 events as 2025, Fox’s Sept. 4 evening broadcast explicitly drew a connection between the two periods.“The protest chaos, which began with riots aimed at social justice in 2020, has severely damaged Portland’s reputation,” the correspondent said.The dramatic footage at this moment shows fires in the street and was broadcast on Fox on Aug. 19, 2020, the day after a crowd smashed through windows and set items on fire in the headquarters for the government of Multnomah County, where Portland is located.We don’t know for certain which broadcast got Trump thinking about Portland. The White House did not respond to questions about what Trump watched. But the president said on Sept. 5 that what he’d seen about Portland on TV was “unbelievable.”“I didn’t know that was still going on,” he said. “This has been going on for years.”The reality: Portland’s 2020 social justice protests, which resulted in hundreds of arrests and continued for months, turned sporadic by early 2021. Protests in years since have led to occasional property damage, but nothing in Portland has matched the scale of events that followed Floyd’s death.Portland police Chief Bob Day said at a Sept. 29 press conference that the city had been inaccurately portrayed through the lens of the protests in 2020 and 2021.“What’s actually happening, and the response we’re seeing both from Portlanders and from the Portland Police Bureau,” Day said, “is not in line with that national narrative. And it is frustrating.”In a Sept. 2 segment featuring the video from a day earlier, anchor Bill Hemmer said it shows “riots raging.” Anchor Trace Gallagher teased another Sept. 2 news segment by once again showing the video, saying, “It’s a riot outside a Portland ICE facility.”On a Sept. 2 segment featuring Katie Daviscourt’s Sept. 1 video, anchor Bill Hemmer describes the Sept. 1 protests as “riots raging.” Videos show the violent moments that happened after federal police advanced on protesters. Fox NewsThe Sept. 4 segment shows Julie Parrish, an attorney for a neighbor of the ICE facility, accusing Portland police of saying, “Meh, we’re just gonna let violent rioters do this for 80 straight nights.”The physical behavior of protesters that was captured on the video is not violent. The camera instead shows federal agents advancing on them. In the moments before officers tossed munitions into the crowd, videos show, one protester was blowing bubbles. The Portland police did not declare a riot, a legal designation that allows for an elevated police use of force. (They declared a riot just once, a police spokesperson said, on June 14.)The Sept. 1 protest had “little to no energy,” according to an internal Portland police summary, before federal officers dispersed the crowd to collect a prop guillotine that had been brought. Katie Daviscourt, a Trump-aligned commentator who filmed the clips, noted on X that protesters were having dance parties and that their main problems were “not leaving restricted areas, burning a flag, and possessing a deadly object (guillotine).”ProPublica found a similar pattern for the three months before Fox’s Sept. 4 broadcast: clashes that on most days and nights had no criminal allegations of protester violence to explain them.After dozens of arrests and charges were announced in June through July 4, federal prosecutors accused just three people of crimes at the ICE building in the roughly two months leading up to Fox’s Sept. 4 broadcast.During that same two-month time frame, ProPublica’s review found numerous instances of police using force: videos from more than 20 days or nights with federal officers grabbing, shoving, pepper-spraying, tackling, firing on or using other munitions on protesters.No local arrests or federal criminal charges were announced on these days or nights, and only a handful of dates corresponded with incidents of protester aggression later asserted by federal authorities in their legal case for sending troops.Asked whether Fox News accurately represented her footage, Daviscourt said: “I stand by my four months of accurate reporting.”Parrish told ProPublica she had collected evidence that “shows ongoing and persistent activity” outside the facility that under statute and police directive “would be considered riotous, unlawful assembly and/or disorderly conduct.” She declined to share this evidence, saying it was privileged as part of her client’s file.Her lawsuit on behalf of a neighbor living near the ICE facility, which sought to require police to enforce Portland’s noise ordinance, was dismissed.A Sept. 5 “Fox & Friends” segment showed a neighbor from an apartment building confronting protesters over noise, shouting at protesters: “Turn that (bleep) down, it’s midnight! … We the people need sleep!”Fox said it happened Tuesday, which would have been Sept. 2. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, “This has been going on for months now, but a lot of this since Labor Day,” as the video shown on screen sandwiches footage of the neighbor between other scenes from the Labor Day protest.“This is a chaotic city,” co-host Brian Kilmeade said.The next day, the clip of the neighbor appeared again on Fox News. This time, the network said the footage was from Wednesday, or Sept. 3.In reality, the confrontation was captured on video months before. Daviscourt published the video on June 29 on X.On the two September nights that Fox said the neighbor’s confrontation happened, ProPublica’s review found no videos of violent clashes posted on social media, and federal authorities announced no arrests.For example, according to a Portland police email from 11:22 p.m. on Sept. 3: “There are still about 20 people hanging around but only 4 were even on the sidewalk in front of the building.”Misrepresentations Continue After Trump’s Guard OrderOn Sept. 28, the day Trump’s order was implemented, a Fox News broadcast played a clip of Kotek saying that Guard troops were not needed in Portland, then immediately cut to a clip of a hectic scene of protesters clashing with police.“Wish she could see some of those images,” the anchor said. Sarcastically, as a co-anchor chuckled, she added: “Look at that. Just a peaceful protest.”A small box on the screen showed the footage wasn’t from Oregon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Creating communal computers (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/667</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/667/the-changelog-667.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Spencer Chang caught our attention with the alive internet theory website, but he creates all kinds of computery things to bring people together around play, connection, and creation.

Trump’s DOJ Ordered Them To Take The Blatantly Illegal Path Instead</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/19/texas-gop-had-a-legal-path-to-gerrymander-trumps-doj-ordered-them-to-take-the-blatantly-illegal-path-instead/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:50:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s say, hypothetically, you want to gerrymander some congressional districts to help your party win more seats. Here are a couple of options:Do blatant  gerrymandering, which is cynical and corrupt but in most cases (tragically and unfortunately) perfectly legal under current US law.Do  gerrymandering, which will definitely get you sued and probably lose in court for violating the fairly clear Voting Rights Act restrictions on racial classifications.Which do you choose? If you said “obviously option 1,” congratulations, you understand the law better than the Trump administration’s Department of Justice. Because the Trump administration just got legally smacked down for picking option 2.Trump’s broader redistricting push kicked off partisan gerrymandering efforts across the country, including in California where voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure (Prop 50) to temporarily redistrict solely to counteract Texas’ gerrymandering. That measure originally included a provision that it would only go into effect if Texas went through with its plan, but that provision was removed before the vote. The (unlikely, but suddenly possible) end result now might be that California gerrymanders, while Texas doesn’t. Oops.When Trump first demanded that Texas redistrict to stop Democrats from winning seats in the House, Texas Republicans initially balked. This is now long-forgotten history, but it’s true. They were a bit worried about how all this would go over.The push from Washington has unnerved some Texas Republicans, who worry that reworking the boundaries of Texas House seats to turn Democratic districts red by adding reliably Republican voters from neighboring Republican districts could backfire in an election that is already expected to favor Democrats.But then Trump’s team of legal geniuses found an innovative solution: they reframed their  gerrymandering as a civil rights imperative, thereby transforming a legal (if obnoxious) political maneuver into an illegal racial classification scheme.The mastermind behind this strategy was Harmeet Dhillon, Trump’s choice to run the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. (You might remember Dhillon from her previous career filing lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved conservatives who felt insufficiently appreciated.) But her letter to Texas officials demanding race-based redistricting represents a new level of culture war-driven legal incompetence.It’s really worth appreciating just how stupid and counterproductive this letter was, as is laid out by the judge in this case.Judge Brown—who clerked for current Texas Governor Greg Abbott when Abbott was on the Texas Supreme Court and who previously blocked Biden’s COVID vaccine mandate—is hardly what anyone would call an “activist leftist judge.” Which makes his scathing assessment of the Trump administration’s approach all the more damning.Because those Texas legislators were so hesitant, Dhillon sent them a letter trying to argue that the state was violating civil rights laws if they didn’t redistrict along racial lines, and that apparently kicked off all this nonsense.Judge Brown pointed out how absurd all this is:Earlier this year, President Trump began urging Texas to redraw its U.S. House map to create five additional Republican seats. Lawmakers reportedly met that request to redistrict on purely partisan grounds with apprehension. When the Governor announced his intent to call a special legislative session, he didn’t even place redistricting on the legislative agenda.But when the Trump Administration reframed its request as a demand to redistrict congressional seats based on their racial makeup, Texas lawmakers immediately jumped on board.On July 7, Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), sent a letter (“the DOJ Letter”) to the Governor and Attorney General of Texasmaking the legally incorrect assertion that four congressional districts in Texas were “unconstitutional” because they were “coalition districts”—majority-non-White districtsin which no single racial group constituted a 50% majority. In the letter,DOJ threatened legal action if Texas didn’t immediately dismantle and redraw these districts—a threat based entirely on their racial makeup. Notably, the DOJ Letter targeted only majority-non-White districts.Any mention of majority-White Democrat districts—which DOJ presumably would have also targeted if its aims were partisan rather than racial—was conspicuously absent.So let’s be clear about what happened here. Texas Republicans were reluctant to do a straightforward partisan gerrymander. Then the Trump DOJ came along and said “actually, you have to do this because of ,” and suddenly everyone was enthusiastic. The racist incompetence is staggering.Once Dhillon gave them the racial justification, Texas immediately jumped on board:Two days later, citing the DOJ Letter, the Governor added redistricting to the special session’s legislative agenda. In doing so, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to draw a new U.S. House map to resolve DOJ’s concerns.In other words, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race.In press appearances, the Governor plainly and expressly disavowed any partisan objective and instead repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts.Incredibly, the MAGA GOP just kept admitting over and over again that they did this for racial reasons:The bill’s sponsors’ statements suggest they adopted those changes because such a map would be an easier sell than a purely partisan one. The Speaker of the House also issued a press release celebrating that the bill satisfactorily addressed DOJ’s “concerns.” Other high-ranking legislators stated in media interviews that the Legislature had redistricted not for the political goal of appeasing President Trump nor of gaining five Republican U.S. House seats, but to achieve DOJ’s racial goal of eliminating coalition districts.Their own flimsy excuse transformed what would have been legal (if cynical) partisan gerrymandering into illegal racial gerrymandering, violating the Voting Rights Act. They literally were so desperate to lie about the unpalatable reasons for their gerrymandering that they moved from the obnoxious and corrupt version to the blatantly illegal justification. And didn’t even stop to think that might sink the entire enterprise.You know how they say “the coverup is worse than the crime?” Well, here, it’s basically just the coverup that is the crime. If they had just done this for the real reasons they were likely doing this (to stifle Democrats), it had a much higher chance of passing judicial muster.Judge Brown, for his part, seems almost personally offended by the quality of Dhillon’s legal work. He publishes her entire letter in the ruling, and then writes:It’s challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors. Indeed, even attorneys employed by the Texas Attorney General—who professes to be a political ally of the Trump Administration—describe the DOJ Letter as “legally[] unsound,” “baseless,” “erroneous,” “ham-fisted,” and “a mess.”The judge walks through every bit of the letter and just how ridiculous it is. Here’s just a snippet, but it goes on like this for a while:Legally and factually, DOJ had no valid argument that the Legislature should restore the House map to some preexisting racial equilibrium since Petteway supplanted Campos. Far from seeking to “rectify . . . racial gerrymandering,” the DOJ Letter urges Texas to inject racial considerations into what Texas insists was a race-blind process.But what about DOJ’s assertion that “TX-33 is [a] racially-based coalition district that resulted from a federal court order years ago”? If a court forced Texas to draw CD 33 as a coalition district based on Campos’s discredited interpretation of VRA § 2, can’t the Legislature redraw that district now that VRA § 2 no longer requires coalition districts?The short answer is that this is another one of the DOJ Letter’s many inaccuracies.As the Judge explains, if Dhillon and the Trump administration had just told them to go for blatantly partisan redistricting, it might have worked. But they didn’t.Here too, if the Governor had explicitly directed the Legislature to amend the congressional map to improve Republican performance, the Plaintiff Groups would then face a higher burden to prove that the motivation for the 2025 redistricting was racial rather than political. Instead, by incorporating DOJ’s race-based redistricting request by reference, the Governor was asking the Legislature to give DOJ the racial rebalancing it wanted—and for the reasons that DOJ cited.Think about the strategic incompetence here. Everyone involved was apparently so desperate to avoid saying “we’re doing partisan gerrymandering” that they kept loudly announcing “we’re doing racial gerrymandering instead!” They traded a probably legal (if obnoxious) justification for an obviously illegal (and still awful) one.When given an opportunity to publicly proclaim that his motivation for adding redistricting to the legislative agenda was solely to improve Republicans’ electoral prospects at President Trump’s request, the Governor denied any such motivation. Instead, the Governor expressly stated that his predominant motivation was racial: he “wanted to remove . . . coalition districts” and “provide more seats for Hispanics.” The fact that the racially reconfigured districts would happen to favor Republicans was, to paraphrase the Governor’s own words, just a fortuitous coincidence.The most remarkable part of all this? Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton actually tried to save them. He sent a letter to the Trump administration essentially pushing back on Dhillon’s demands, while saying “hey, you know we could just do this for partisan reasons, right? That would be legal?” But they were so bought into the racism that nobody listened.At the same time the Governor was announcing the 2025 Map’s racial objectives to the press,the Attorney General of Texas was saying the opposite.Just two days after the Governor added redistricting to the legislative agenda based on DOJ’s “constitutional concerns,” the Attorney General sent DOJ a response to its letter.That response said essentially the same thing we say above—that the change in law effected by Petteway cast no doubt on the legality of the 2021 Map, since there’s no indication that the 2021 Legislature drew any coalition districts for legal-compliance reasons that it wouldn’t have drawn anyway for race-neutral reasons like partisanship. Although the Attorney General doesn’t say so explicitly,the purpose behind his letter appears to have been to refocus the redistricting dialogue toward permissible considerations like partisanship, politics, and traditional districting criteria—and away from legally fraught considerations like race.If that was the letter’s purpose, it didn’t work.Just a fantastic level of failure all around.Again, this isn’t some “activist leftist judge” as MAGA would have you believe—we’ve already established Brown’s conservative credentials.Now, the case goes straight to the Supreme Court (skipping the Fifth Circuit), and Paxton has already announced plans to appeal quickly. He’s claiming the map is “entirely legal,” which is a bold stance given that his own office tried to warn everyone this was illegal. But Paxton’s capacity for hypocrisy has never been his limiting factor.Will the Supreme Court overrule Judge Brown? It’s entirely possible—perhaps likely. The Court has spent much of the past year rubber-stamping Trump administration priorities, often without much explanation. But Judge Brown clearly wrote this opinion with the Supreme Court in mind, and specifically with Chief Justice John Roberts in mind. He opens the entire ruling by quoting Roberts’ own 2007 opinion about race-based classifications:“The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”Will that convince any of the motivated SCOTUS Justices to admit to what’s going on here? Perhaps not, but they’ll have to bend over backwards to ignore what’s happened here, given that the Trump administration served up the illegal basis for this decision on a silver platter for all involved.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The Complete Superstar Photographer Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/19/daily-deal-the-complete-superstar-photographer-bundle/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:45:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Complete Superstar Photographer Bundle has 11 courses to help take your photography skills to the next level.

We're excited to release our VS Code/Cursor extension for marimo [1], an open-source, reactive Python notebook.This extension provides a native experience for working with marimo notebooks, a long-requested feature that we’ve worked hard to get right.An LSP-first architectureThe core of our extension is a marimo notebook language server (marimo-lsp [2]). As far as we know, it’s the first notebook runtime to take this approach. The Language Server Protocol (LSP) [3] offers a small but important set of notebook-related capabilities that we use for document and kernel syncing; everything else is handled through custom actions and messages.By building on LSP, we aim to create a path to expose marimo capabilities in additional environments (beyond VS Code/Cursor). The notebook features in LSP are still limited, but as the protocol evolves, we’ll be able to shift more functionality out of the extension and into the language server, making it available to a wider range of editors and tools. For example, this could enable:- structural edits to notebook documents (e.g., adding or removing cells) [4]- editor hover information that reflects the live runtime values of variablesDeep uv integration with PEP 723Because marimo notebooks are plain Python files, we adopt PEP 723-style inline metadata [5] to describe a notebook’s environment. Tools such as uv already support this format: they read the metadata block, build or update the corresponding environment, and run the script inside it.The marimo CLI already integrates with uv in "sandbox" mode [6] to manage an isolated environment defined by PEP 723 metadata for a single notebook. In the extension, our uv-based “sandbox controller” manages multiple notebooks: each notebook gets its own isolated, cached environment. The controller keeps the environment aligned with the dependencies declared in the file and can update that metadata automatically when imports are missing.uv normally syncs such environments whenever you run a script, ensuring it matches the dependencies declared in its metadata; we apply this concept at the cell level so the environment stays in sync whenever cells run. The same cached uv environment is reused if you run the notebook as a script via uv (e.g., uv run notebook.py).This work has been a complete rewrite, and we're grateful to the community for early feedback. While VS Code and the LSP support a subset of notebook features, the ecosystem has been shaped heavily by Jupyter, and we’ve had to work around some assumptions baked into existing APIs. We’ve been coordinating with the VS Code team and hope our work can help broaden the conversation—pushing the LSP notebook model forward and making room for runtimes that aren’t Jupyter-based.We'd love to hear your thoughts!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Astonishing Science of Gravity with Brian Cox | Horizon | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJt99qHTsd4</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hJt99qHTsd4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Professor Brian Cox visits an observatory with one main goal in mind, understanding what on Earth is wrong with gravity!

We commend the labor, digital rights, and other advocates who have worked to enactandprotectit. Colorado recently delayed the Act’s effective date to June 30, 2026.EFF looks forward to enforcement of the Colorado AI Act, opposes weakening or further delaying it, and supports strengthening it.What the Colorado AI Act DoesThe Colorado AI Act is a good step in the right direction. It regulates “high risk AI systems,” meaning machine-based technologies that are a “substantial factor” in deciding whether a person will have access to education, employment, loans, government services, healthcare, housing, insurance, or legal services. An AI-system is a “substantial factor” in those decisions if it assisted in the decision and could alter its outcome. The Act’s protections include transparency, due process, and impact assessments.The Act is a solid foundation. Still, EFF urges Colorado to strengthen itThe Act requires “developers” (who create high-risk AI systems) and “deployers” (who use them) to provide information to the general public and affected individuals about these systems, including their purposes, the types and sources of inputs, and efforts to mitigate known harms. Developers and deployers also must notify people if they are being subjected to these systems. Transparency protections like these can be a baseline in a comprehensive regulatory program that facilitates enforcement of other protections. The Act empowers people subjected to high-risk AI systems to exercise some self-help to seek a fair decision about them. A deployer must notify them of the reasons for the decision, the degree the system contributed to the decision, and the types and sources of inputs. The deployer also must provide them an opportunity to correct any incorrect inputs. And the deployer must provide them an opportunity to appeal, including with human review.The Act requires a developer, before providing a high-risk AI system to a deployer, to disclose known or reasonably foreseeable discriminatory harms by the system, and the intended use of the AI. In turn, the Act requires a deployer to complete an annual impact assessment for each of its high-risk AI systems, including a review of whether they cause algorithmic discrimination. A deployer also must implement a risk management program that is proportionate to the nature and scope of the AI, the sensitivity of the data it processes, and more. Deployers must regularly review their risk management programs to identify and mitigate any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination. Impact assessment regulations like these can helpfully place a proactive duty on developers and deployers to find and solve problems, as opposed to doing nothing until an individual subjected to a high-risk system comes forward to exercise their rights.How the Colorado AI Act Should Be StrengthenedThe Act is a solid foundation. Still, EFF urges Colorado to strengthen it, especially in its enforcement mechanisms.. The Colorado AI Act grants exclusive enforcement to the state attorney general. But no regulatory agency will ever have enough resources to investigate and enforce all violations of a law, and many government agencies get “captured” by the industries they are supposed to regulate. So Colorado should amend its Act to empower ordinary people to sue the companies that violate their legal protections from high-risk AI systems. This is often called a “private right of action,” and it is the best way to ensure robust enforcement. For example, the people of Illinois and Texas on paper have similar rights to biometric privacy, but in practice the people of Illinois have far more enjoyment of this right because they can sue violators.Civil rights enforcement. One of the biggest problems with high-risk AI systems is that they recurringly have an unfair disparate impact against vulnerable groups, and so one of the biggest solutions will be vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws. Unfortunately, the Colorado AI Act contains a confusing “rebuttable presumption” – that is, an evidentiary thumb on the scale – that may impede such enforcement. Specifically, if a deployer or developer complies with the Act, then they get a rebuttable presumption that they complied with the Act’s requirement of “reasonable care” to protect people from algorithmic discrimination. In practice, this may make it harder for a person subjected to a high-risk AI system to prove their discrimination claim. Other civil rights laws generally do not have this kind of provision. Colorado should amend its Act to remove it.Colorado is off to an important start. Now it should strengthen its AI Act, and should not weaken or further delay it. Other states must enact their own laws. All manner of automated decision-making systems are unfairly depriving people of jobs, health care, and more.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Friendsgiving? #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zqhUbdAy1X4</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zqhUbdAy1X4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:28:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanksgiving is arguably one of the yummiest celebrations in the US and one where you’re expected to be home for the holidays.

In all likelihood, it will just lead to Trump and his administration smearing one of this nation’s allies for being weak on crime and  supportive of people who are being murdered by the US government.But it should matter to everyone else. The United States was once the leader of the free world, even with all of its current and historical flaws. It’s no longer interested in any version of “freedom” that doesn’t involve making people feel it’s alright to engage in open bigotry. And it no longer deserves to be called the “leader” of , since it’s in the process of devolving into an authoritarian state with white Christian nationalist desires. The mass deportation program that has been running at full speed since Trump retook the Oval Office has been abjectly and objectively miserable. Irrational hatred is now just public policy, overseen by grinning “Village of the Damned”-esque kids with swastikas pinwheeling in their creepy, dead eyes. Not the UK has been much better for most of its history. It spent a lot of its history engaging in open racism and bigotry-as-public-policy colonialism. Even now, its desire to be more harmful to immigrants, privacy rights, and anything not completely Union Jacked has seen it devolve in the same direction the United States is now headed, albeit with a bit more internal division.The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.[S]hortly after the US began launching lethal strikes against the boats in September, however, the UK grew concerned that the US might use intelligence provided by the British to select targets. British officials believe the US military strikes, which have killed 76 people, violate international law, the sources said. The intelligence pause began over a month ago, they said.The UK government did the right thing. Even if some in the UK government might be aligned with Trump in terms of going full Duterte, there’s no reason to continue to act as an accomplice in the extrajudicial killings. Even if the political winds fail to shift in the United States at the end of Trump’s second term, the man who has spent his entire presidential career antagonizing most of the rest of the world has made enough enemies that he won’t have many supporters if an internationally-backed prosecution attempt arises in the future. Even military officials are starting to back away from the boat strike program, even as the Trump-beholden DOJ Office of Legal Counsel continues to issue questionable memos that claim “this all very legal, actually.” It certainly doesn’t  legal, which creates some problems in the court of public opinion. In courts that actually have the power to do something about it, these outrageous claims of absolute executive power have already worn thin. As for the official US response, it’s limited to this for the moment: The British embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official told CNN that the department “doesn’t talk about intelligence matters.”LMAO. The Defense Department talks about “intelligence matters” in chats that have included journalists, family members, and family lawyers. And Trump himself has unilaterally (and very unofficially) declassified intelligence information by splattering it all over the pages of TruthSocial and X. All that’s being said here is that the government won’t talk about things it doesn’t want to discuss, right up until an administration official (or Trump himself) decides it’s time to get bitchy about this regime being treated like the untrustworthy piece of shit it is. That will probably happen sooner, rather than later. As the CNN report notes, both Canada and Colombia have done the same thing, preventing the US military from using intelligence these countries have collected to target people in boats in international waters.

Adding to the confusion, the subreddit’s mods have said that political comments are still allowed, just not posts. “After careful consideration, internal discussion and tons of external feedback we have collectively decided that  is not the place for politics anymore,” moderator OutdoorRink said in a post  today.The new policy has not gone over well. For the last 10 years, the Joe Rogan Experience has been a central part of American political life. He interviews entertainers, yes, but also politicians and powerful businessmen. He had Donald Trump on the show and endorsed his bid for President. During the COVID and lockdown era, Rogan cast himself as an opposition figure to the heavy regulatory hand of the state. In a recent episode, Rogan’s guest was another podcaster, Adam Carolla, and the two spent hours talking about Covid lockdowns, Gavin Newsom, and specific environmental laws and building codes they argue is preventing Los Angeles from rebuilding after the Palisades fire.To hear the mods tell it, the subreddit is banning politics out of concern for Rogan’s listeners. “For too long this subreddit has been overrun by users who are pushing a political agenda, both left and right, and that stops today,” the post announcing the ban said. “It is not lost on us that Joe has become increasingly political in recent years and that his endorsement of Trump may have helped get him elected. That said, we are not equipped to properly moderate, arbitrate and curate political posts…while also promoting free speech.” To be fair, as Rogan’s popularity exploded over the years, and as his politics have shifted to the right, many Reddit users have turned to the r/JoeRogan to complain about the direction Rogan and his podcast have taken. These posts are often antagonistic to Rogan and his fans, but are still “on-topic.”Over the past few months, the moderator who announced the ban has . On November 3, they said that changes were coming to the moderation philosophy of the sub. “In the past few years, a significant group of users have been taking advantage of our ‘anything goes’ free speech policy,” they said. “This is not a political subreddit. Obviously Joe has dipped his toes in the political arena so we have allowed politics to become a component of the daily content here. That said, I think most of you will agree that it has gone too far and has attracted people who come here solely to push their political agenda with little interest in Rogan or his show.” A few days later the mod posted a link to a CBC investigation into MMA gym owners with neo-Nazi ties, a story only connected to Rogan by his interested in MMA and work as a UFC commentator.r/JoeRogan’s users see the new “no political posts” policy as hypocrisy. And a lot of them think it has everything to do with recent revelations about Jeffrey Epstein. The connections between Epstein, Trump, and various other Rogan guests have been building for years. A recent, , dump of  contained multiple references to Trump and Congress is set to release more.  “Random new mod appears and want to ruin this sub on a pathetic power trip. Transparently an attempt to cover for the pedophiles in power that Joe endorsed and supports. Not going to work,” one commenter said under the  announcing the new ban.“Perfectly timed around the Epstein files due to be released as well. So much for being free speech warriors eh space chimps?,” .“Talking politics was great when it was all dunking on trans people and brown people but now that people have to defend pedophiles that banned hemp it's not so fun anymore,” .You can see the remnants of pre-politics bans discussions lingering on r/JoeRogan. There are, of course, clips from the show and discussions of its guests but there’s also a lot of , , and fans questioning why Rogan  out about Epstein recently after talking about it on the podcast for years.Multiple guests Rogan has hosted on the show have turned up in the Epstein files, chief among them Donald Trump. The House GOP slipped a ban on hemp into the bill to re-open the government, a move that will  that’s allowed people to legally smoke weed in states like Texas. These are not the kinds of things the chill apes of Rogan’s fandom wanted.“I think we all know what eventually happened to Joe and his podcast. The slow infiltration of right wing grifters coupled with Covid, it very much did change him. And I saw firsthand how that trickled down into the comedy community, especially one where he was instrumental in helping to rebuild. Instead of it being a platform to share his interests and eccentricities, it became a place to share his grievances and fears….how can we not expect to be allowed to talk about this?” user GreppMichaels said. “Do people really think this sub can go back to silly light chatter about aliens or conspiracies? Joe did this, how do the mods think we can pretend otherwise?”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Chinese Criminals Steal Your Credit Card With Just One Text | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxn62DjzaBs</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jxn62DjzaBs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:01:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal investigators say that crime groups in China are behind the toll fine scam messages that made more than $1 billion over the last three years.

When the LGBTQ+ community moves to the country | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yz90nUBc7M</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3Yz90nUBc7M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Queer people who live in rural areas and come out often face major challenges. While the LGBTQ+ community has battled to secure its place in urban centers, out in the provinces, worlds frequently collide.

"I could move to the big city like so many others do, but I want to make a difference." Eric is gay and lives in a small town in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where he struggles to find acceptance. Especially when he organizes the region's first Pride parade. "The district is a right-wing stronghold. Many people around me are concerned and afraid," he says. Against all odds and defying prejudice, Eric goes ahead with the Pride event, amid a large police presence. Will the celebration pass off peacefully in this small town? "I used to know many people who actually think homosexuality is a disease," says Eric.
 
For a long time, Tina, who comes from a small village in the Black Forest region, struggled to accept herself. When she wanted to have a child, she moved back to her home village with wife Sarah. But with four generations living under her parents' roof, the couple is finding things hard: "We did wonder if it would work out, because you're moving to a village and leaving the anonymity of the big city behind," says Tina.

Christian is also about to leave Berlin to live with his fiancé Jens in a small village in Mecklenburg. They plan to live in a house that Christian has inherited, but until now the building has housed the village’s only pub - which has had to close to make way for the couple. Will they ever find acceptance in the village?

When Joe came out as non-binary around two years ago and started wearing skirts and makeup, it was mainly Joe's mother who had to field questions from people in the small East Frisian village where they live. Joe is keen to change their name on their official ID, in line with Germany's Self-Determination Act, but the registry office is uncooperative. "It was one of the worst phone calls of my life," says Joe. But they are not giving up.

The documentary allows viewers to witness quiet struggles as well as moments of solidarity. It demonstrates that social change and acceptance can develop outside of urban centers. Rural communities, too, can be places where queer people find ways to assert their place in society.

The databases included nearly two million photos and videos, including many photos of completely random people with very little digital footprint. The exposed data shows how many people use AI roleplay apps that allow face-swapping features: to create nonconsensual sexual imagery of everyone, from the most famous entertainers in the world to women who are not public figures in any way. In addition to the real photo inputs, the exposed data includes AI-generated outputs, which are mostly sexual and often incredibly graphic. Unlike “nudify” apps that generate nude images of real people, these images are putting people into AI-generated videos of hardcore sexual scenarios.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>If you thought ALL Italians in WW2 were Axis, think again! #ww2 #italy #germany #rebel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5LQFCoFiReQ</link><author>WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5LQFCoFiReQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSGFY2a_DYK8plQI_fcY_Xg">Podcast - WW2 Pod</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WW2 Pod: We Have Ways of Making You Talk

Admittedly the edits weren’t the best idea; they effectively cobbled together two different parts of Trump’s January 6 speech 54 minutes apart not to misrepresent, but to make it more clear that Trump actively encouraged an open, violent insurrection that resulted in fatalities. Obviously our mad, idiot king didn’t much like that. “US President Donald Trump says he intends to sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion “probably sometime next week” despite the broadcaster’s apology to him over a documentary Trump’s lawyers described as defamatory.“I think I have to do it,” Trump told reporters. “They’ve even admitted that they cheated … They cheated, they changed the words coming out of my mouth.”Again, the edits didn’t entirely “change the words coming out of Trump’s mouth,” because he actively did vocally support a violent insurrection against the government. They did however cobble together two different parts of a speech to make it sound like they were said all at once, something the documentary editors should have known better than to do given king dingus’ litigious nature. Granted Trump may not have as much fun in British courts, where Justices and Judges are likely to be less receptive to Donald’s incoherence. UK defamation laws are also an entirely different affair, with Trump being particularly challenged by the fact the BBC edits occurred more than twelve months ago, and defamation action in UK courts must occur within twelve months of the alleged offense. It sounds like BBC leadership isn’t entirely invertebrate. While BBC officials like Chair BBC chair Samir Shah admit the edits were an “error of judgment” (unlike executives at CBS) it appears they’ll actually be putting up a fight in court of Trump follows through:“I want to be very clear with you – our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this.”As Trump’s health, power, and influence wanes, this sort of bullying is only going to become less and less effective and more and more toothless. In the interim, it would be nice if some major media institutions could dig deep and find a little backbone; especially given how many lawyers and donors would be happy to help fund a pro bono acceleration of Donald Trump’s inevitable collapse. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond Chat: Bringing Models to the Canvas • Lu Wilson • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSTOENRgt7g</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pSTOENRgt7g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:01:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

ABSTRACT
Whenever a new technology appears, our first instinct as developers is to offer "text" as the primary method of interaction. This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.

At tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising. [...]

The human side is missing.”“Jamal has been forgotten. The human side is missing.”On the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting between the two leaders was a $600 billion deal between Saudi Arabia and the US.  Facing the press together at the White House, President Trump called the crown prince “his friend” and teased that the Saudis “might make it to $1 trillion”.The President also told reporters during that meeting that the crown prince “knew nothing” about the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, and said “a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen.”Matt Frei asked Ms Khashoggi whether business relations were now more important than anything else for the US and Saudi Arabia, and she said it “made her feel sore.”“Everybody focuses only on money and the business deal, economic deals, selling weapons,” she replied, “but the human side is missing there, which is the legacy of Jamal, justice for Jamal and justice for me as well.”“There are other political prisoners still in jail,” she added, such as her own Saudi lawyer, who was a close friend of Jamal.Matt Frei asked whether Ms Khashoggi thinks Saudi Arabia can ever be truly modern, if critics are treated in the way her late husband was.“If they continue this way then no,” she said. “They need to change and to have some tolerance.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Philippines Mayor With a Dark Secret | Exclusive Preview</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peGR7Y6yoA8</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/peGR7Y6yoA8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:36:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch the full episode exclusively on Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-13/mystery-of-alice-guo-and-how-pogos-unleashed-transnational-crime-in-philippines?embedded-checkout=true

Ted has spent his life working in entertainment, from producing commercials in Florida to exploring virtual reality at Fox and Paramount, and we thought his perspective on the relationship between technology and entertainment could help us better understand where we might be headed. Over the course of our conversation, we discover that to think of the future, we need to remember the past, and Ted connects recent developments in technology to a number of breakthroughs he was witness to himself. We learn about Grass Valley—the video equivalent of Silicon Valley—and of the origins of the RED camera system, and Ted reveals Apple's early attempts to bring digital video to their computer systems. We also discuss modern consumer trends and our changing relationships with screens, and we learn about Kodak's missed opportunity in the prehistoric days of digital cameras. Ted later shares his observations on AI, and he makes a prediction of what we'll see over the next five years of cinema.

gazed beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide
wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes
seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The
breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development
and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by
volunteering yourself or through organisation contributions to the Python Software Foundation.Regards from a crisp and sunny subzero Helsinki,Your release team,

Attlee threatened legal action over the title of the book, arguing that her trademark for “Sabzi” had been violated. The problem, as we noted at the time, is that “sabzi” isn’t some made up word; it’s a Persian word used in cooking for herbs or vegetables (shout out to a commenter in the previous post who explained an even more nuanced definition of the term in its original use/form) and is in wide use by those who speak the language.I had argued this was akin to attempts to trademark words like “pho” or “pretzel crisps”, but some in our comments disagreed. I’m still comfortable with my original analysis, that categories of entire common food types should probably not be trademarkable by themselves and, even if they are, shouldn’t be weaponized in the manner that Attlee was attempting.A Cornish deli owner has withdrawn her complaint over the use of her company’s name on a cookery book. A Bloomsbury spokesperson said: “We are pleased that Kate Attlee has done the right thing and withdrawn her complaint.“It has been our position from the outset that the use of the descriptive term Sabzi as the title of Ms Khan’s cookbook does not constitute trademark use and does not infringe any IP (intellectual property) rights.“We wish Kate Attlee continued success with her deli business”.That doesn’t read as any kind of settlement having been reached. It doesn’t read as though Bloomsbury has conceded anything at all in the dispute. That’s the kind of statement a company puts out if it was the beneficiary of essentially unconditional surrender.Look, I’m glad Attlee got to this place and dropped the dispute. But it should be a lesson to everyone else that engaging in this kind of overprotectionist activity often times is going to produce a whole lot of nothing for the aggressor and, at worst, can generate some negative PR as well. So maybe just don’t threaten others over fairly generic and descriptive terms, okay?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Wants to Sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia: What It Means for the Middle East</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/g3UcznQ3qDU</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/g3UcznQ3qDU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 03:52:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WSJ’s Shelby Holliday breaks down President Trump’s deal to sell advanced F-35 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia.

Kissing is one of humanity’s most cherished rituals—just think of the sheer variety of smooches, from the “wedding kiss” to the “kiss of death.” Now, scientists have discovered that the origins of this behavior, which is widespread among many primates, likely dates back at least 21 million years, according to a study published on Tuesday in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior.  In other words, our early primate relatives were sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G, in the early Miocene period. Moreover, the deep evolutionary roots of kissing suggest that Neanderthals likely smooched each other, and probably our human ancestors as well. The new study is the first attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary timeline of kissing by analyzing a wealth of observations about this behavior in modern primates and other animals. “It is kind of baffling to me that people haven't looked at this from an evolutionary perspective before,” said Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford who led the study, in a call with 404 Media. “There have been some people who have put ideas out there, but no one's done it in a systematic way.”“Kissing doesn't occur in all human cultures, but in those that it does, it's really important,” she added. “That's why we thought it was really exciting to study.”The ritual of the “first kiss” is a common romantic trope, but tracking down the “first kiss” in an evolutionary sense is no easy feat. For starters, the adaptive benefits of kissing have long eluded researchers. Mouth-to-mouth contact raises the odds of oral disease transfer, and it’s not at all clear what advantages puckering up confers to make it worth the trouble.“Kissing is kind of risky,” Brindle said. “You're getting very close to another animal's face. There could be diseases. To me, that suggests that it is important. There must be some benefits to this behavior.”Some common explanations for sex-related kissing include mate evaluation—bad breath or other red flags during a smoochfest might affect the decision to move on to copulation. Kissing may also stimulate sexual receptiveness and perhaps boost the odds of fertilization. In platonic contexts, kissing could serve a social purpose, similar to grooming, of solidifying bonds between parents and offspring, or even to smooth over conflicts between group members. “We know that chimpanzees, when they've had a bit of a bust up, will often go and kiss each other and make up,” Brindle said. “That might be really useful for navigating social relationships. Primates are obviously an incredibly social group of animals, and so this could be just a social lubricant for them.”Though most of us have probably never considered the question, Brindle and her colleagues first had to ask: what is a kiss? They made a point to exclude forms of oral contact that don’t fall into the traditional idea of kissing as a prosocial behavior. For example, lots of animals share food directly through mouth-to-mouth contact, such as regurgitation from a parent to offspring. In addition, some animals display antagonistic behavior through mouth-to-mouth contact, such as “kiss-fighting” behavior seen in some fish. The team ultimately defined kissing as “a non-agonistic interaction involving directed, intraspecific, oral-oral contact with some movement of the lips/mouthparts and no food transfer.” Many animals engage in kissing under these terms—from insects, to birds, to mammals—but the researchers were most interested in primates.To that end, they gathered observations of kissing across primate species and fed the data into models that analyzed the timeline of the behavior through the evolutionary relationships between species. The basic idea is that if humans, bonobos, and chimpanzees all kiss (which they do) then the common ancestor of these species likely kissed as well. The results revealed that the evolutionary “first kiss” likely occurred among primates at least 21 million years ago. Since Neanderthals and our own species, , are known to have interbred—plus they also shared oral microbes—the team speculates that Neanderthals and our own human ancestors might have kissed as well.   While the study provides a foundation for the origins of kissing, Brindle said there is not yet enough empirical data to test out different hypotheses about its benefits—or to explain why it is important in some species and cultures, but not others. To that end, she hopes other scientists will be inspired to report more observations about kissing in wild and captive animal populations.“I was actually surprised that there were so few data out there,” Brindle said. “I thought that this would be way better documented when I started this study. What I would really love is, for people who see this behavior, to note it down, report it, so that we can actually start collecting more contextual information: Is this a romantic or a platonic kiss? Who were the actors in it? Was it an adult male and an adult female, or a mother and offspring? Were they eating at the time? Was there copulation before or after the kiss?”“These sorts of questions will enable us to pick apart these potential adaptive hypotheses,” she concluded., our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How an Execution in Texas Sparked a National Debate | Death by Fire (full documentary) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzJS7VRQ30k</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LzJS7VRQ30k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Did Texas execute an innocent man? This 2010 documentary investigates the controversial death penalty case of Cameron Todd Willingham — and the scientific validity of the arson evidence used to convict him of the deaths of his three children.

The execution of Cameron Todd Willingham in Texas in 2004 became the center of a national debate about the death penalty and the science behind arson investigations.

Drawing on unique access to those closest to the Willingham case, “Death by Fire” meticulously examines the evidence used to convict Willingham, and explores the implications of the execution of a possibly innocent man.

Through interviews with Willingham’s friends and family, the documentary tells the story of a troubled young man with a history of domestic violence who quickly became the prime suspect in his children’s deaths. The discovery by fire investigators of more than 20 indicators of arson at the scene of the fire pointed directly to Willingham’s guilt.

But the re-examination of the case turned on a critical finding that came only weeks before Willingham’s scheduled execution: The investigators who determined that he had set the fire that killed his three daughters had relied on an outdated understanding of arson evidence. 

Experts told FRONTLINE there could be hundreds of innocent people in prison for arson cases where the evidence was misinterpreted by investigators.

“Death by Fire” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group in association with StartBox Films. The producer and director is Jessie Deeter. The writers are Mike Wiser and Michael Kirk. The co-producer is Mike Wiser and the senior producer is Michael Kirk.

Each field can be projected independently and a single field can only be projected multiple times in a shared way. The current design uses two different traits to model this. The two traits are almost identical, except for their safety documentation.We were thinking if it is possible to unify them into a single trait and have coercions similar to autoreborrowing that would allow the borrow checker to change the behavior depending on which type is projected.There are lots of different possibilities for which syntax we can choose, here are a couple options: /, /, /x.mut[Fatih Kadir Akın][], x.ref.[Fatih Kadir Akın][]/. Also many alternatives for the sigils used: , , .We have yet to decide on a direction we want to go in. If we are able to merge the two project traits, we can also settle on a single syntax which would be great.Splitting Projections into Containers & PointersThere are two categories of projections: Containers and Pointers: are types like , , , . They are  and apply themselves to each field, so  has a field of type  (if  has a field of type ). are types like , , , /, . They support projecting  to .In the current design, these two classes of projections are unified by just implementing Pointer<'_, Container<Struct>> -> Pointer<'_, Container<Field>> manually for the common use-cases (for example &mut MaybeUninit<Struct> -> &mut MaybeUninit<Field>). However this means that things like &Cell<MaybeUninit<Struct>> doesn't have native projections unless we explicitly implement them.We could try to go for a design that has two different ways to implement projections -- one for containers and one for pointers. But this has the following issues:there are two ways to implement projections, which means that some people will get confused which one they should use.making projections through multiple container types work out of the box is great, however this means that when defining a new container type and making it available for projections, one needs to consider all other container types and swear coherence with them. If we instead have an explicit way to opt in to projections through multiple container types, the implementer of that trait only has to reason about the types involved in that operation.
so to rephrase, the current design allows more container types that users actually use to be projected whereas the split design allows arbitrary nestings of container types to be projected while disallowing certain types to be considered container types.The same problem exists for allowing all container types to be projected by pointer types, if I define a new pointer type I again need to reason about all container types and if it's sound to project them.We might be able to come up with a sensible definition of "container type" which then resolves these issues, but further investigation is required.Projections for We want to be able to have both a blanket impl<T, F: Field<Base = T>> Project<F> for &T as well as allow people to have custom projections on . The motivating example for custom projections is the Rust-for-Linux  that wants these projections for safe RCU abstractions.During the design meeting, it was suggested we could add a generic to  that only the compiler is allowed to insert, this would allow disambiguation between the two impls. We have now found an alternative approach that requires less specific compiler magic:Add a new marker trait  that's implemented for all types by default.People can opt out of implementing it by writing impl !ProjectableBase for MyStruct; (needs negative impls for ).We add  to the .The compiler needs to consider the negative impls in the overlap check for users to be able to write their own impl<U, F> Project<F> for &Custom<U> where ... (needs negative impl overlap reasoning)We probably want negative impls for marker traits as well as improved overlap reasoning for different reasons too, so it is probably fine to depend on them here. and  shouldn't be available for projections by default, take for example , if we project to a variant, someone else could overwrite the value with a different variant, invalidating our . This also needs a new trait, probably  (needs more name bikeshedding, but too early for that) that marks fields in structs and tuples.To properly project an , we need:a new  (TBB) trait that provides a way to read the discriminant that's currently inhabiting the value.
it also needs to guarantee that the discriminant doesn't change while fields are being projected (this rules out implementing it for )a new  operator that will project all mentioned fields (for  this already is the behavior for )Field Representing Types (FRTs)While implementing https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146307 we identified the following problems/design decisions:a FRT is considered local to the orphan check when each container base type involved in the field path is local or a tuple (see the top comment on the PR for more infos)FRTs cannot implement the  trait is not user-implementabletypes with fields that are dynamically sized don't have a statically known offset, which complicates the  trait,I decided to simplify the first implementation of FRTs and restrict them to sized structs and tuples. It also doesn't support packed structs. Future PRs will add support for enums, unions and packed structs as well as dynamically sized types.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Project goals update — October 2025</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/11/19/project-goals-update-october-2025/</link><author>Tomas Sedovic</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.rust-lang.org/">Rust Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The focus right now is on the "non-const" parts of the proposal, as the "const" parts are blocked on the new trait solver (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/issues/113). Now that the types team FCP https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/144064 has completed, work can proceed to land the implementation PRs. David Wood plans to split the RFC to separate out the "non-const" parts of the proposal so it can move independently, which will enable extern types.To that end, there are three interesting T-lang design questions to be considered.The RFC currently proposes the following namesHowever, these names do not follow the "best practice" of naming the trait after the capability that it provides. As champion Niko is recommending we shift to the following names: -- should righly be called , but oh well, not worth changing. -- named after the method  that you get access to. -- the only thing you can do is point at it.The last trait name is already used by the (unstable)  trait. We do not want to have these literally be the same trait because that trait adds a  associated type which would be backwards incompatible; if existing code uses  to mean <T as SomeOtherTrait>::Metadata, it could introduce ambiguity if now  due to defaults. My proposal is to rename  to std::ptr::PointeeMetadata for now, since that trait is unstable and the design remains under some discussion. The two traits could either be merged eventually or remain separate.Note that  be implemented automatically by the compiler for anything that implements .The RFC proposes that an explicit bound like  disabled the default  bound. However, this gives no signal that this trait bound is "special" or different than any other trait bound. Naming conventions can help here, signalling to users that these are special traits, but that leads to constraints on naming and may not scale as we consider using this mechanism to relax other defaults as proposed in my recent blog post. One idea is to use some form of syntax, so that  is just a regular bound, but (for example)  indicates that this bound "disables" the default  bound. This gives users some signal that something special is going on. This  syntax is borrowing from semver constraints, although it's not a precise match (it does not mean that  doesn't hold, after all). Other proposals would be some other sigil (, but it means "opt out from the traits above you"; , ...) or a keyword (no idea).To help us get a feel for it, I'll use  throughout this post.Implicit trait supertrait bounds, edition interactionIn Rust 2024, a trait is implicitly  which gets mapped to :trait Marker {} // cannot be implemented by extern types
This is not desirable but changing it would be backwards incompatible if traits have default methods that take advantage of this bound:trait NotQuiteMarker {
    fn dummy(&self) {
        let s = size_of_val(self);
    }
}
We need to decide how to handle this. Options areJust change it, breakage will be small (have to test that).Default to  but let users explicitly write  if they want that. Bad because all traits will be incompatible with extern types.Default to  only if defaulted methods are present. Bad because it's a backwards incompatible change to add a defaulted method now.Default to  but add  implicitly to defaulted methods. Now it's not backwards incompatible to add a new defaulted method, but it is backwards incompatible to change an existing method to have a default.If we go with one of the latter options, Niko proposes that we should relax this in the next Edition (Rust 2026?) so that the default becomes  (or maybe not even that, if we can).Relaxing associated type boundsUnder the RFC, existing  bounds would be equivalent to . This is mostly fine but will cause problems in (at least) two specific cases: closure bounds and the  trait. For closures, we can adjust the bound since the associated type is unstable and due to the peculiarities of our  syntax. Failure to adjust the Deref bound in particular would prohibit the use of  where  is an extern type, etc.For deref bounds, David Wood is preparing a PR that simply changes the bound in a backwards incompatible way to assess breakage on crater. There is some chance the breakage will be small.If the breakage proves problematic, or if we find other traits that need to be relaxed in a similar fashion, we do have the option of:In Rust 2024,  becomes equivalent to T: Deref<Target: SizeOfVal> unless written like T: Deref<Target: =Pointee>. We add that annotation throughout stdlib.In Rust 202X, we change the default, so that  does not add any special bounds, and existing Rust 2024  is rewritten to T: Deref<Target: SizeOfVal> as needed.One topic that came up in discussion is that we may eventually wish to add a level "below" , perhaps , that signifies webassembly external values which cannot be pointed at. That is not currently under consideration but should be backwards compatible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Legal Case Against Ring’s Face Recognition Feature</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/18/the-legal-case-against-rings-face-recognition-feature/</link><author>Mario Trujillo</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon Ring’s upcoming face recognition tool has the potential to violate the privacy rights of millions of people and could result in Amazon breaking state biometric privacy laws.Ring plans to introduce a feature to its home surveillance cameras called “Familiar Faces,” to identify specific people who come into view of the camera. When turned on, the feature will scan the faces of all people who approach the camera to try and find a match with a list of pre-saved faces. This will include many people who have not consented to a face scan, including friends and family, political canvassers, postal workers, delivery drivers, children selling cookies, or maybe even some people passing on the sidewalk.Many biometric privacy laws across the country are clear: Companies need your affirmative consent before running face recognition on you. In at least one state, ordinary people with the help of attorneys can challenge Amazon’s data collection. Where not possible, state privacy regulators should step in.What is Ring’s “Familiar Faces”?Amazon describes “Familiar Faces” as a tool that “intelligently recognizes familiar people.” It says this tool will provide camera owners with “personalized context of who is detected, eliminating guesswork and making it effortless to find and review important moments involving specific familiar people.” Amazon plans to release the feature in December.The feature will allow camera owners to tag particular people so Ring cameras can automatically recognize them in the future. In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon. The company would not promise that this feature will remain off by default in the future.Why is This a Privacy Problem?Your biometric data, such as your faceprint, are some of the most sensitive pieces of data that a company can collect. Associated risks include mass surveillance, data breach, and discrimination.Today’s feature to recognize your friend at your front door can easily be repurposed tomorrow for mass surveillance. Ring’s close partnership with police amplifies that threat. For example, in a city dense with face recognition cameras, the entirety of a person’s movements could be tracked with the click of a button, or all people could be identified at a particular location. A recent and unrelated private-public partnership in New Orleans unfortunately shows that mass surveillance through face recognition is not some far flung concern.Amazon has already announced a related tool called “search party” that can identify and track lost dogs using neighbors’ cameras. A tool like this could be repurposed for law enforcement to track people. At least for now, Amazon says it does not have the technical capability to comply with law enforcement demanding a list of all cameras in which a person has been identified. Though, it complies with other law enforcement demands.In addition, data breaches are a perpetual concern with any data collection. Biometrics magnify that risk because your face cannot be reset, unlike a password or credit card number. Amazon says it processes and stores biometrics collected by Ring cameras on its own servers, and that it uses comprehensive security measure to protect the data.Face recognition has also been shown to have higher error rates with certain groups—most prominently with dark-skinned women. Similar technology has also been used to make questionable guesses about a person’s emotions, age, and gender.Will Ring’s “Familiar Faces” Violate State Biometric Laws?Any Ring collection of biometric information in states that require opt-in consent poses huge legal risk for the company. Amazon already told reporters that the feature will not be available in Illinois and Texas—strongly suggesting its feature could not survive legal scrutiny there. The company said it is also avoiding Portland, Oregon, which has a biometric privacy law that similar companies have avoided.Its “familiar faces” feature will necessarily require its cameras to collect a faceprint from of every person who comes into view of an enabled camera, to try and find a match. It is impossible for Amazon to obtain consent from everyone—especially people who do not own Ring cameras. It appears that Amazon will try to unload some consent requirements onto individual camera owners themselves. Amazon says it will provide in-app messages to customers, reminding them to comply with applicable laws. But Amazon—as a company itself collecting, processing, and storing this biometric data—could have its own consent obligations under numerous laws.Many states aside from Illinois and Texas now protect biometric data. While the state has never enforced its law, Washington in 2017 passed a biometric privacy law. In 2023, the state passed an ever stronger law that protects biometric privacy, which allows individuals to sue on their own behalf. And at least 16 states have recently passed comprehensive privacy laws that often require companies to obtain opt-in consent for the collection of sensitive data, which typically includes biometric data. For example, in Colorado, a company that jointly with others determines the purpose and means of processing biometric data must obtain consent. Maryland goes farther, and such companies are essentially prohibited from collecting or processing biometric data from bystanders.Many of these comprehensive laws have numerous loopholes and can only be enforced by state regulators—a glaring weakness facilitated in part by Amazon lobbyists.Nonetheless, Ring’s new feature provides regulators a clear opportunity to step up to investigate, protect people’s privacy, and test the strength of their laws.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kansas County Pays $3 Million Settlement For Illegal Raid Of Local Newspaper’s Office</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/18/nebraska-county-pays-3-million-settlement-for-illegal-raid-of-local-newspapers-office/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 21:42:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This isn’t even the end of the fallout, but it’s a lot of it. A small Kansas town that basically conspired to silence local journalists who were asking too many questions continues to face the consequences of its actions.That’s a relief. Far too often, power gets abused and the justice system sides with the far-more-powerful abusers. That hasn’t happened here. And maybe that’s because it happened in a small town and involved people whose power was too limited to affect anyone else outside of its jurisdiction.But it was corruption. And the local government did deserve to get punished. To recount everything that has happened to this point in detail would take a few thousand words. Suffice to say, what happened here rivals anything seen in pop culture that involves the internal rot of small town governments.Just because you’re wearing a badge doesn’t mean you’re not a bullying thug, as this footage of the (illegal) raid on 98-year-old newspaper owner Joan Meyer’s residence makes clear: There’s Kari Newell, a local business person who was seeking a liquor license for a new business when her previous drunk-driving record became public. There’s County Attorney Joel Ensey, who claimed to have no knowledge of the raid until public records showed he actually knew plenty about it beforehand. There’s the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, which also disavowed all knowledge, until it became clear it had knowledge as well, at which point it began publicly condemning Chief Cody and his department. There’s the mayor who didn’t like his deputy mayor and seemed to be all too willing to indulge the police chief. There’s the judge who signed off on the search warrants without reading them and then tried to distance herself from actions — a judge who apparently had some drunk driving problems of her own. There are the communications Chief Cody made to Kari Newell, informing her he was going to raid the newspaper to shut down its coverage of her and, presumably, any further investigation into his law enforcement past. In the middle of all of this, there’s some bullshit computer crime charges, which were invoked despite the newspaper accessing driver record data legally through a third party.Added to that, there’s the fact that Chief Cody told Kari Newell to delete his texts to her, which has led to the now-resigned police chief facing criminal charges for telling Newell to engage in the destruction of evidence.There’s also the fact that this settlement — obtained with the assistance of the Institute for Justice — is only part of the payout. Former police chief Gideon Cody and the city of Marion are still facing this lawsuit, which is due to enter discovery in the near future. The county involved in a small-town Kansas newspaper raid in 2023 will pay a cumulative $3 million to three journalists and a city councilor.In two of the four agreements, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office also crafted a statement admitting regret.“The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record. This likely would not have happened if established law had been reviewed and applied prior to the execution of the warrants,” the statement reads.Unfortunately, those apologies were only extended to the owner of the newspaper (Eric Meyer, whose 98-year-old mother died the day after the raid of her home) and vice-mayor Ruth Herbel, who was somehow dragged into this simply because she clashed frequently with Mayor David Mayfield and was hit with a recall petition created by the mayor’s wife. The other two journalists receiving a payout from the county (Deb Gruver and Phyllis Zorn) will only get the money. There’s no apology in here for them, despite them being equally subjected to unconstitutional searches and seizures by local law enforcement. I’m sure they’re happy with being compensated for rights violations, but it seems weird the county would not extend the same courtesy to people who suffered through an illegal search just because they were at work (rather than in their own homes) when it happened.In some cases, law enforcement officials violate rights because they think they’re too big to go after. In other cases — like this one — they seem to do it because they think everyone around them is too small to matter. If nothing else, the outcome of this lawsuit has derailed that misconception and hopefully will deter this sort of thing in the future. If it doesn’t, a city and county that have already committed far more money than they possibly ever expected to shell out at one time will find themselves being bankrupted by people hired to not only serve their residents, but ensure their money is well-spent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Astead Herndon joins Vox!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aeMXSlysTZ8</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aeMXSlysTZ8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 21:33:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Our Vox family just got bigger! 💛 Astead Herndon, the award-winning political journalist and former host of the New York Times’ podcast The Run-up has joined Vox as a host and editorial director.

For nearly a decade, Cromwell wielded unprecedented authority, orchestrating the break from Rome, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the destruction of Anne Boleyn. Yet his bloody partnership with the volatile Tudor king would end exactly as it began - with violence, betrayal, and the executioner's axe.

This documentary chronicles the complete story of Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell's deadly alliance, from Cromwell's meteoric rise through the Tudor court to his catastrophic fall from grace in 1540. We examine how this blacksmith's son transformed himself into Henry's indispensable fixer, the brutal methods he employed to consolidate royal power, his role in the executions of Catherine Howard, Anne Boleyn, and Thomas More, and the fatal miscalculation that cost him everything. Through contemporary accounts and modern scholarship, we reveal the true nature of one of history's most consequential and ruthless political partnerships.

But in that war on terror, at least the US asked Congress for permission.This would provide the justification for the extraordinary action that began on September 2, as the US started to blow alleged drug gangs out of the water.By this weekend, they had hit 21 boats headed out from Venezuela, many in the Caribbean sea, and killed 83 people.Trump’s administration says it is going after drug cartels, as it once did Al Qaeda. But in that war on terror, at least the US asked Congress for permission.But without presenting any evidence that the boats were indeed carrying drugs, lawyers around the world have made it clear: these missile attacks are a breach of international law.And even a Republican senator, Rand Paul, has described them as “extrajudicial killings”.Trump’s administration says it is going after drug cartels, as it once did Al Qaeda. But in that war on terror, at least the US asked Congress for permission.The President has claimed that each strike saves 25,000 lives, describing bags of fentanyl floating in the waters in the aftermath of each strike.So the argument, frankly, doesn’t stack up.In truth, this feels more like a geopolitical powerplay, in which the US is trying to exert its influence over the Western hemisphere by propping up its favoured leaders like Argentina’s Javier Milei with a $20bn bailout, while targeting those it wants to oust like Maduro.Venezuela isn’t even a major producer of illegal drugs, it is primarily a transit.And even American intelligence has suggested Maduro is not running the drug gangs that the administration previously named.Maduro’s popularity in VenezuelaOf course, there may be good reason to want to remove Maduro, who has led a decades long regime he inherited from the late Hugo Chavez in 2013.The leader of the opposition Maria Corina Machado – who was given the Nobel Peace Prize this year – is much more pro-Trump.But this is unlikely to be a humanitarian mission by Trump.Before these tensions flared – a presidential envoy, Richard Grenell, was discussing a deal with Venezuelan officials which would have seen Maduro’s nation hand the US a dominant stake in its oil reserves; the biggest proven oil reserves of any country in the world.The deal would reportedly have redirected oil from China to the US.“You could strike a million boats and kill a million people – the drugs would still come.”In Trinidad, I have spoken to fishermen – who have lost more than half of their income because they are scared to travel the 30 miles they need to in order to secure the best catch – to military sources, to the family of a Trinidadian killed in strikes.And they are all convinced that this is not really about drugs – but regime change and oil.One fisherman of 40 years here told me: “You could strike a million boats and kill a million people – the drugs would still come.”That is why he – and so many others – are convinced Trump has a different endgame.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John Brown’s Body, by Stephen Vincent Benét</title><link>https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/stephen-vincent-benet/john-browns-body</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/stephen-vincent-benet/john-browns-body/downloads/stephen-vincent-benet_john-browns-body.epub?source=feed" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:13:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard E-Books</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The sweeping tragedy of the American Civil War is chronicled through the interwoven experiences of soldiers and civilians from both the North and the South.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Book Reports Potentially Copyright Infringing, Thanks To Court Attacks On LLMs</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/18/book-reports-potentially-copyright-infringing-thanks-to-court-attacks-on-llms/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:07:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A federal judge just ruled that computer-generated summaries of novels are “very likely infringing,” which would effectively outlaw many book reports. That seems like a problem.This isn’t just about AI—it’s about fundamentally redefining what copyright protects. And once again, something that should be perfectly fine is being treated as an evil that must be punished, all because some new machine did it.But, I guess elementary school kids can rejoice that they now have an excuse not to do a book report.To be clear, I doubt publishers are going to head into elementary school classrooms to sue students, but you never know with the copyright maximalists.Sag highlights how it could have a much more dangerous impact beyond getting kids out of their homework: making much of Wikipedia infringing.A new ruling in Authors Guild v. OpenAI has major implications for copyright law, well beyond artificial intelligence. On October 27, 2025, Judge Sidney Stein of the Southern District of New York denied OpenAI’s motion to dismiss claims that ChatGPT outputs infringed the rights of authors such as George R.R. Martin and David Baldacci. The opinion suggests that short summaries of popular works of fiction are very likely infringing (unless fair use comes to the rescue).This is a fundamental assault on the idea, expression, distinction as applied to works of fiction. It places thousands of Wikipedia entries in the copyright crosshairs and suggests that any kind of summary or analysis of a work of fiction is presumptively infringing.Short summaries of copyright-covered works should not impact copyright in any way. Yes, as Sag points out, “fair use” can rescue in some cases, but the old saw remains that “fair use is just the right to hire a lawyer.” And when the process is the punishment, saying that fair use will save you in these cases is of little comfort. Getting a ruling on fair use will run you hundreds of thousands of dollars at least.Copyright is supposed to stop the outright copying of the copyright-protected expression. A  is not that. It should not implicate the copyright in any form, and it shouldn’t require fair use to come to the rescue.Sag lays out the details of what happened in this case:Judge Stein then went on to evaluate one of the more detailed chat-GPT generated summaries relating to A Game of Thrones, the 694 page novel by George R. R. Martin which eventually became the famous HBO series of the same name. Even though this was only a motion to dismiss, where the cards are stacked against the defendant, I was surprised by how easily the judge could conclude that:“A more discerning observer could easily conclude that this detailed summary is substantially similar to Martin’s original work, including because the summary conveys the overall tone and feel of the original work by parroting the plot, characters, and themes of the original.”The judge described the ChatGPT summaries as:“most certainly attempts at abridgment or condensation of some of the central copyrightable elements of the original works such as setting, plot, and characters”“conceptually similar to—although admittedly less detailed than—the plot summaries in Twin Peaks and in Penguin Random House LLC v. Colting, where the district court found that works that summarized in detail the plot, characters, and themes of original works were substantially similar to the original works.” (emphasis added).To say that the less than 580-word GPT summary of A Game of Thrones is “less detailed” than the 128-page Welcome to Twin Peaks Guide in the Twin Peaks case, or the various children’s books based on famous works of literature in the Colting case, is a bit of an understatement.Yikes. I’m sorry, but if you think that a 580-word computer-generated summary of a massive book is infringing, then we’ve lost the plot when it comes to copyright law. If it were, then copyright itself would need to be radically changed to allow for basic forms of human speech. If I see a movie and tell my friend what it was about, that shouldn’t implicate copyright law, even if it summarizes “the plot, characters, and themes of the original work.”Sag then ties this to what you can find for countless creative works on Wikipedia:To see why the latest OpenAI ruling is so surprising, it helps to compare the ChatGPT summary of A Game of Thrones to the equivalent. I read them both so you don’t have to.The ChatGPT summary of a Game of Thrones is about 580 words long and captures the essential narrative arc of the novel. It covers all three major storylines: the political intrigue in King’s Landing culminating in Ned Stark’s execution (spoiler alert), Jon Snow’s journey with the Night’s Watch at the Wall, and Daenerys Targaryen’s transformation from fearful bride (more on this shortly) to dragon mother across the Narrow Sea. In this regard, it is very much like the 800 word Wikipedia plot summary. Each summary presents the central conflict between the Starks and Lannisters, the revelation of Cersei and Jaime’s incestuous relationship, and the key plot points that set the larger series in motion.And, look, if you want to see the chilling effects on speech created by over expansive copyright law, well:I could say more about their similarities, but I’m concerned that if I explored the summaries in any greater detail, the Authors Guild might think that I am also infringing George R. R. Martin’s copyright, so I’ll move on to the minor differences.You can argue that Sag, an expert on copyright law, is kind of making a joke here, but it’s no actual joke. Just the fact that someone even needs to consider this shows how bonkers and problematic this ruling is.As Sag makes clear, there are few people out there who would legitimately think that the Wikipedia summary should be deemed infringing, which is why this ruling is notable. It again highlights how lots of people, including the media, lawmakers, and now (apparently) judges, get so distracted by the “but this new machine is bad!” in looking at LLM technology that they seem to completely lose the plot.And that’s dangerous for the future of speech in general. We shouldn’t be tossing out fundamental key concepts in speech (“you can summarize a work of art without fear”) just because some new kind of summarization tool exists.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Could a time machine really work?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/judC2AxbgLk</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/judC2AxbgLk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is a time machine really possible?

The conference has been running at various venues over the last 31 years, and has become well-known as one of the better hacking and security research conferences in the world. Tuesday, the conference told members of its mailing list that it had “received some disturbing news,” and that “we have been told that ‘materials and messaging’ at our most recent conference ‘were not in alignment with the mission, values, and reputation of St. John’s University’ and that we would no longer be able to host our events there.” The conference said that after this year’s conference, they had received “universal praise” from St. John’s staff, and said they were “caught by surprise” by the announcement. “What we're told - and what we find rather hard to believe - is that all of this came about because a single person thought we were promoting an anti-police agenda,” the email said. “They had spotted pamphlets on a table which an attendee had apparently brought to HOPE that espoused that view. Instead of bringing this to our attention, they went to the president's office at St. John's after the conference had ended. That office held an investigation which we had no knowledge of and reached its decision earlier this month. The lack of due process on its own is extremely disturbing.”“The intent of the person behind this appears clear: shut down events like ours and make no attempt to actually communicate or resolve the issue,” the email continued. “If it wasn't this pamphlet, it would have been something else. In this day and age where academic institutions live in fear of offending the same authorities we've been challenging for decades, this isn't entirely surprising. It is, however, greatly disappointing.”St. John’s University did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hacking and security conferences in general have a long history of being surveilled by or losing their venues. For example, attendees of the DEF CON hacking conference have reported being surveilled and having their rooms searched; last year, some casinos in Las Vegas made it clear that DEF CON attendees were not welcome. And academic institutions have been vigorously attacked by the Trump administration over the last few months over the courses they teach, the research they fund, and the events they hold, though we currently do not know the specifics of why St. John’s made this decision. It is not clear what pamphlets HOPE is referencing, and the conference did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the conference noted that St. Johns could have made up any pretext for banning them. It is worth mentioning that Joshua Aaron, the creator of the ICEBlock ICE tracking app, presented at HOPE this year. ICEBlock has since been deleted by the Apple App Store and the Google Play store after being pressured by the Trump administration. “Our content has always been somewhat edgy and we take pride in challenging policies we see as unfair, exposing security weaknesses, standing up for individual privacy rights, and defending freedom of speech,” HOPE wrote in the email. The conference said that it has not yet decided what it will do next year, but that it may look for another venue, or that it might “take a year off and try to build something bigger.” “There will be many people who will say this is what we get for being too outspoken and for giving a platform to controversial people and ideas. But it's this spirit that defines who we are; it's driven all 16 of our past conferences. There are also those who thought it was foolish to ever expect a religious institution to understand and work with us,” the conference added. “We are not changing who we are and what we stand for any more than we'd expect others to. We have high standards for our speakers, presenters, and staff. We value inclusivity and we have never tolerated hate, abuse, or harassment towards anyone. This should not be news, as HOPE has been around for a while and is well known for its uniqueness, spirit, and positivity.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ACLU and EFF Sue a City Blanketed With Flock Surveillance Cameras</title><link>https://www.404media.co/aclu-and-eff-sue-a-city-blanketed-with-flock-surveillance-cameras/</link><author>Jason Koebler</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/CleanShot-2025-11-18-at-11.27.06@2x.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 19:31:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sued the city of San Jose, California over its deployment of Flock’s license plate-reading surveillance cameras, claiming that the city’s nearly 500 cameras create a pervasive database of residents movements in a surveillance network that is essentially impossible to avoid. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Services, Immigrant Rights & Education Network and Council on American-Islamic Relations, California, and claims that the surveillance is a violation of California’s constitution and its privacy laws. The lawsuit seeks to require police to get a warrant in order to search Flock’s license plate system. The lawsuit is one of the highest profile cases challenging Flock; a similar lawsuit in Norfolk, Virginia seeks to get Flock’s network shut down in that city altogether.“San Jose’s ALPR [automatic license plate reader] program stands apart in its invasiveness,” ACLU of Northern California and EFF lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. “While many California agencies run ALPR systems, few retain the locations of drivers for an entire year like San Jose. Further, it is difficult for most residents of San Jose to get to work, pick up their kids, or obtain medical care without driving, and the City has blanketed its roads with nearly 500 ALPRs.”The lawsuit argues that San Jose’s Flock cameras “are an invasive mass surveillance technology” that “collect[s] driver locations en masse.”“Most drivers are unaware that San Jose’s Police Department is tracking their locations and do not know all that their saved location data can reveal about their private lives and activities,” it adds. The city of San Jose currently has at least 474 ALPR cameras, up from 149 at the end of 2023; according to data from the city, more than 2.6 million vehicles were tracked using Flock in the month of October alone. The lawsuit states that Flock ALPRs are stationed all over the city, including “around highly sensitive locations including clinics, immigration centers, and places of worship. For example, three ALPR cameras are positioned on the roads directly outside an immigration law firm.” Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director for the EFF, told 404 Media in a phone call that “it’s fair to say that anyone driving in San Jose is likely to have their license plates captured many times a day. That pervasiveness is important.”The lawsuit argues that warrantless searches of these cameras are illegal under the California constitution’s search and seizure clause, which Crocker said “has been interpreted to be even stronger than the Fourth Amendment,” as well as other California privacy laws. The case is part of a broader backlash against Flock as it expands around the United States. 404 Media’s reporting has shown that the company collects millions of records from around the country, and that it has made its national database of car locations available to local cops who have in turn worked with ICE. Some of those searches have violated California and Illinois law, and have led to reforms from the company. Crocker said that many of these problems will be solved if police simply need to get a warrant to search the system.“Our legal theory and the remedy we’re seeking is quite simple. We think they need a warrant to search these databases,” he said. “The warrant requirement is massive and should help in terms of preventing these searches because they will have to be approved by a judge.” The case in Norfolk is ongoing. San Jose Police Department and Flock did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DOJ Memo Says It Won’t Prosecute US Troops No Matter How Illegal Trump’s Boat Strike Program Is</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/18/doj-memo-says-it-wont-prosecute-us-troops-no-matter-how-illegal-trumps-boat-strike-program-is/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:50:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Not content to simply deport as many South American migrants from this country as possible, the Trump administration leaned into its lies about the latent threat to national security the mere  of foreign people poses to national security. This administration pretends everything is a “war,” even as it actively avoids seeking congressional approval to engage in acts of war. Migrants crossing the border is a “war.” Migrants residing in this country without the proper paperwork is a “war.” And now, foreign people in boats departing from countries Trump deeply dislikes is now an act of “war,” apparently justifying whatever actions the government chooses to take. In this case, it’s a ton of extrajudicial killings predicated on the after-the-fact assertion that alleged drug trafficking is a literal violent attack on America.The administration’s extrajudicial killing program debuted days ahead of the eventual legal “justification” for murdering people in international waters. Since then, the number of attacks has continued to increase. And yet the administration has refused to provide anything more than conclusory statements in support of its actions, all written by loyalist lawyers who apparently feel their continued employment rests upon their willingness to be on the wrong side of history.No doubt it does. As the attacks escalate, the administration keeps digging deeper in hopes of finding the magic (legal) bullet that will justify something that looks like straight-up murder. It still hasn’t found anything capable of heading off legal challenges to its boat strike program, but it’s apparently hoping this memo recently issued by the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel will prevent anyone in the military associated with these extrajudicial killings from being held legally accountable for engaging in illegal activities. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) stated in a classified opinion drawn up in the summer that personnel taking part in military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in Latin America would not be exposed to future prosecution, according to four people familiar with the matter.The decision to pursue an opinion, drafted in July, reflects the heightened concerns within the government raised by senior civilian and military lawyers that such strikes would be illegal.As the Washington Post report notes, more than few people in the higher ranks have questioned this shift towards attacking non-military targets who — at best — are only  of participating in drug trafficking. The administration insists (without facts in evidence) that everyone it kills is deeply involved in the international drug trade and are probably high-ranking members of drug cartels.Obviously, that can’t possibly be true. And it definitely isn’t, as a recent investigation by US journalists made clear. These actions have prompted resignations by US military officials, including Admiral Alvin Holsey, who retired rather than serve a government that has deliberately unmoored itself from constitutional boundaries and long-held American ideals.Of course, the Nimrods heading the “War Department” could care less about losing even more talent. All Trump and his immediate subordinates desire is more subordination from those in the ranks, especially those expected to support this regime’s authoritarian trickle-down effect. A Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, has previously denied that Holsey had “hesitation or any concerns” about the mission. A spokesperson for Holsey said he had no information to provide about such discussions.In a statement to The Post Wednesday, Parnell said, “current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law,” with all actions in “complete compliance with the law of armed conflict.”Parnell, like  administration spokespeople, is not to be trusted. Everyone speaking for the administration lies constantly, when not otherwise engaged in social media posts even the most racist nine-year-old would find childish. The memo issued by the OLC goes even further than the sock puppet currently speaking for the entire military. According to the OLC, boat strikes are justified because drug traffickers are using funds to engage in a “non-international armed conflict,” which seems pretty weird when everyone being murdered by the US military are in boats that have left foreign countries and are being sunk while still in international waters.The OLC also claims the fact that drug money may be used to “finance campaigns of violence and extortion,” which apparently justifies what’s happening to  happens to be in boats destroyed by US military attacks. But that assertion is a deliberate twist of phrase that hopes to sweep these boat strikes under the Executive Branch’s absurdly large Article II powers rug. Violence and extortion are definitely part of drug trafficking, but those acts are committed to  drug trafficking. Drug traffickers are not selling drugs to  these criminal acts with the intent of targeting American citizens with violence. But that’s what’s being claimed here by the OLC, which is hoping to justify extrajudicial killings after the fact.Just because this administration constantly says things that aren’t true doesn’t make them true, as legal professionals (including former OLC lawyers) are being forced to state with alarming frequency: Adam Isacson, a scholar at the Washington Office on Latin America, said “there is no proof” that the gangs are using drug profits with the intent of promoting violence or mayhem in the United States.“These groups are businesses,” he said. “If they are carrying out violence in the United States, they are doing it for profit, not for the purpose of sowing terror.”Yeah, it’s an absurd assertion. I would assume the release of the OLC’s memo making these claims was greeted by constant [Many people are typing] messages in CIA chat groups. The CIA knows how to sell drugs and topple governments. The boats leaving Venezuela (allegedly) filled with drugs and traffickers ain’t it. This is a government hoping to back its way into congressional and/or court blessing of its shoot-first, don’t even bother asking questions later off-shore murder operation. And now it’s telling those who might be first against the wall if and when it all falls apart that they don’t need to worry about being murderers because, at the very least, any DOJ run by Trump or one his successor puppets will never treat them like the accomplices they are.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: RowboatX – open-source Claude Code for everyday automations</title><link>https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</link><author>segmenta</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Claude Code is great, but it’s focused on coding. The missing piece is a native way to build and run custom background agents for non-code tasks. We built RowboatX as a CLI tool modeled after Claude Code that lets you do that. It uses the file system and unix tools to create and monitor background agents for everyday tasks, connect them to any MCP server for tools, and reason over their outputs.Because RowboatX runs locally with shell access, the agents can install tools, execute code, and automate anything you could do in a terminal with your explicit permission. It works with any compatible LLM, including open-source ones.For example, you can connect RowboatX to the ElevenLabs MCP server and create a background workflow that produces a NotebookLM-style podcast every day from recent AI-agent papers on arXiv. Or you can connect it to Google Calendar and Exa Search to research meeting attendees and generate briefs before each event.You can try these with: `npx @rowboatlabs/rowboatx`We combined three simple ideas:1. File system as state: Each agent’s instruction, memory, logs, and data are just files on disk, grepable, diffable, and local. For instance, you can just run: grep -rl '"agent":"2. The supervisor agent: A Claude Code style agent that can create and run background agents. It predominantly uses Unix commands to monitor, update, and schedule agents. LLMs handle Unix tools better than backend APIs [1][2], so we leaned into that. It can also probe any MCP server and attach the tools to the agents.3. Human-in-the-loop: Each background agent can emit a human_request message when needed (e.g. drafting a tricky email or installing a tool) that pauses execution and waits for input before continuing. The supervisor coordinates this.I started my career over a decade ago building spam detection models at Twitter, spending a lot of my time in the terminal with Unix commands for data analysis [0] and Vowpal Wabbit for modeling. When Claude Code came along, it felt familiar and amazing to work with. But trying to use it beyond code always felt a bit forced. We built RowboatX to bring that same workflow to everyday tasks. It is Apache-2.0 licensed and easily extendable.While there are many agent builders, running on the user's terminal enables unique use cases like computer and browser automation that cloud-based tools can't match. This power requires careful safety design. We implemented command-level allow/deny lists, with containerization coming next. We’ve tried to design for safety from day one, but we’d love to hear the community’s perspective on what additional safeguards or approaches you’d consider important here.We’re excited to share RowboatX with everyone here. We’d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The Complete MATLAB Programming Master Class</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/18/daily-deal-the-complete-matlab-programming-master-class-12/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:45:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creating of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.

TIP is the Travel Intelligence Program. As part of that, ARC sold access to a massive database of peoples’ flights, showing who travelled where, and when, and what credit card they used. “All TIP customers, including the government agencies referenced in your letter, were notified on November 12, 2025, that TIP is sunsetting this year,” Reishus continued. Reishus was responding to a letter sent to airline executives earlier on Tuesday by Senator Ron Wyden, Congressman Andy Biggs, Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Adriano Espaillat, and Senator Cynthia Lummis. That letter revealed the IRS’s warrantless use of ARC’s data and urged the airlines to stop the ARC program. ARC says it notified Espaillat's office on November 14.ARC is co-owned by United, American, Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, Alaska, Lufthansa, Air France, and Air Canada. The data broker acts as a bridge between airlines and travel agencies. Whenever someone books a flight through one of more than 12,800 travel agencies, such as Expedia, Kayak, or Priceline, ARC receives information about that booking. It then packages much of that data and sells it to the government, which can search it by name, credit card, and more.  that ARC’s customers include the FBI, multiple components of the Department of Homeland Security, ATF, the SEC, TSA, and the State Department.  Espaillat told 404 Media in a statement “this is what we do. This is how we’re fighting back. Other industry groups in the private sector should follow suit. They should not be in cahoots with ICE, especially in ways may be illegal.”Wyden said in a statement “it shouldn't have taken pressure from Congress for the airlines to finally shut down the sale of their customers’ travel data to government agencies by ARC, but better late than never. I hope other industries will see that selling off their customers' data to the government and anyone with a checkbook is bad for business and follow suit.”“Because ARC only has data on tickets booked through travel agencies, government agencies seeking information about Americans who book tickets directly with an airline must issue a subpoena or obtain a court order to obtain those records. But ARC’s data sales still enable government agencies to search through a database containing 50% of all tickets booked without seeking approval from a judge,” the letter from the lawmakers reads. Update: this piece has been updated to include statements from CHC Chair Espaillat and Senator Wyden.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bonkers Bitcoin heist: 5-star hotels, cash-filled envelopes, vanishing funds</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/11/bonkers-bitcoin-heist-5-star-hotels-cash-filled-envelopes-vanishing-funds/</link><author>Joel Khalili</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1321675861-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:37:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As Kent Halliburton stood in a bathroom at the Rosewood Hotel in central Amsterdam, thousands of miles from home, running his fingers through an envelope filled with 10,000 euros in crisp banknotes, he started to wonder what he had gotten himself into.Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States.As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family.

He made his living pushing exactly the kind of inflammatory political content that these senators now claim is so dangerous it requires dismantling core legal protections for speech. Their solution to political violence inspired by online rhetoric is to create a legal framework that will massively increase censorship of political speech.Which they claim they’re doing… in support of free speech.Almost everything about what they’re saying is backwards.The two Senators spoke at an event at Utah Valley University, where Charlie Kirk was shot, to talk about how they were hoping to stop political violence. That’s a worthwhile goal, but their proposed solution reveals they don’t understand how Section 230 actually works.The senators also used their bipartisan panel on Wednesday to announce plans to hold social media companies accountable for the type of harmful content promoted around the assassination of Kirk, which they say leads to political violence.During their televised discussion, Curtis and Kelly previewed a bill they intend to introduce shortly that would remove liability protection for social media companies that boost content that contributes to political radicalization and violence.The “Algorithm Accountability Act” would transform one of the pillars of internet governance by reforming a 30-year-old regulation known as Section 230 that gives online platforms legal immunity for content posted by their users.“What we’re saying is this is creating an environment that is causing all sorts of harm in our society and particularly with our youth, and it needs to be addressed,” Curtis told the Deseret News.The bill would strip Section 230 protections from companies if it can be proven in court that they used an algorithm to amplify content that caused harm. This change means tech giants would “own” the harmful content they promote, creating a private cause of action for individuals to sue.Like so many politicians who want to gut Section 230, Kelly and Curtis clearly don’t understand how it actually works. Their “Algorithm Accountability Act” would create exactly the kind of censorship regime they claim to oppose.It’s kind of incredible how many times I’ve had to say this to US Senators, but repealing 230 doesn’t make companies automatically responsible for speech. That’s literally not how it works. They’re still protected by the First Amendment.It just makes it much more expensive to defend hosting speech, which means they will take one of two approaches: (1) host way less speech and become much, much more restricted in what people can say or (2) do little to no moderation, because under the First Amendment, they can only be held liable if they have knowledge of legally violative content.And most of the content that would be covered by this bill “speech that contributes to political radicalization” is, um, kinda quintessentially protected by the First Amendment.Kelly’s comments reveal the stunning cognitive dissonance at the heart of this proposal:“I did not agree with him on much. But I’ll tell you what, I will go to war to fight for his right to say what he believes,” said Kelly, who is a former Navy pilot. “Even if you disagree with somebody, doesn’t mean you put a wall up between you and them.”This is breathtaking doublethink. Kelly claims he’ll “go to war” to protect Kirk’s right to speak while literally authoring legislation that will silence the platforms where that speech happens. It’s like saying “I’ll defend your right to assembly” while bulldozing every meeting hall in town.Curtis manages to be even more confused:What this bill would do, Curtis explained, is open up these trillion-dollar companies to the same kind of liability that tobacco companies and other industries face.“If they’re responsible for something going out that caused harm, they are responsible. So think twice before you magnify. Why do these things need to be magnified at all?” Curtis said.This comparison is absurdly stupid. Tobacco is a physical product that literally destroys your lungs and causes cancer. Speech is expression protected by the First Amendment. Curtis is essentially arguing that if political speech influences someone’s behavior in a way he doesn’t like, the platform should be liable—as if words and ideas are chemically addictive carcinogens.The entire point of the First Amendment is that we don’t consider speech to be harmful.What Curtis is proposing is holding companies liable whenever speech “causes harm,” which is fucking terrifying when Trump and his FCC are already threatening platforms for hosting criticism of the administration.The political implications here are staggering. Kelly, a Democrat, is signing onto a bill that will let Trump and MAGA supporters (the bill has a private right of action that will let anyone sue!) basically sue every internet platform for “promoting” content they deem politically polarizing, which they will say is anything that criticizes Trump or promotes “woke” views.And why is he pushing such a bill in supposed support of Charlie Kirk, a person whose only job was pushing political polarization, and whose entire “debate me bro” shtick was entirely designed to push political polarization online?What are we even doing here?This entire proposal is a monument to confused thinking. Kelly and Curtis claim they want to honor Charlie Kirk by passing legislation that would have silenced the very platforms where he built his career. They claim to support free speech while authoring a bill designed to chill political expression. They worry about political polarization while creating a legal weapon that will be used almost exclusively by the most polarizing political actors to silence their critics.Rolling back Section 230 will lead to much greater censorship, not less. Claiming it’s necessary to diminish political polarization is disconnected from reality. But at least it will come in handy for whoever challenges this law as unconstitutional—the backers are out there openly admitting they’re introducing legislation designed to violate the First Amendment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Ireland Got One of the Highest GDPs Per Capita</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jk4eEqBq1oo</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Jk4eEqBq1oo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hannah Fry travels through Ireland to uncover how this small nation became a hub for global tech giants and one of the richest countries per capita in 2024.

With dictator Bashar al-Assad and his regime now gone, he's one of thousands of Syrians wondering whether it's time to return home.

It’s been ten years since Tadmory left Syria. Now, a German citizen, he’s embarking on a personal journey to find out whether his future lies in his adopted country or his homeland. Does he feel there is a place for him in Germany amid growing racism, including calls for "remigration"? And does the Syria he grew up in still exist after 13 years of war?
In addition to visiting his native city of Homs, Tadmory also speaks with other Syrians in Germany who come from a variety of backgrounds and have differing opinions on the big question. They include Mohammed in Dortmund, a metalworker who has decided to go back to Syria for good under the German government’s voluntary return program; Leen, a student living in Berlin, who believes that Germany - despite political tensions and challenges - remains the safest place for her; and Maher, a dentist in Münster who, along with his German fiancé, is developing an emergency "Plan B,” in case the German far-right AfD party gains control of the government. 
Tadmory is torn. He wants to stay in Germany, but would return to Syria if his mother were deported.
Can and will Germany ever feel like home? If so, under what conditions? These questions resonate not just with Tadmory, but with countless other migrants who have built a new life in this country. And he also poses these very questions to the politicians who are shaping both public discourse and policy.

He drew comparisons to the late 1990s Internet boom, which saw early Internet company valuations surge before collapsing in 2000, leading to bankruptcies and job losses.“We can look back at the Internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the Internet was profound,” Pichai said. “I expect AI to be the same. So I think it’s both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Controversial Place America Owns</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFbDHtQN3Bs</link><author>neo</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iFbDHtQN3Bs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYKe7-XbaDjpUwcU5x0bLg">neo</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get Nebula for 40% off an annual subscription using my link: https://go.nebula.tv/neo

Sleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic. Only about 1 in 10 teens gets the 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians. So, what’s going on? And what changes can be made to address this issue? Wendy Troxel shares how early school start times and public policy are depriving adolescents of sleep at a time when they need it most.

                The three-body problem is one of the most famous challenges in classical physics and celestial
                mechanics.
                It asks: given the initial positions, masses, and velocities of three bodies in space, can we predict
                their
                future motion under mutual gravitational attraction?
            N-Body Gravitational Simulation
                This simulator uses Newton's law of universal gravitation to model the gravitational forces between
                every pair of bodies:
            
                F = G × m₁ × m₂ / (r² + ε²)
            
                Each body experiences the sum of all pairwise gravitational forces from every other
                body.
                For N bodies, this requires calculating N(N-1)/2 force pairs each timestep. The ε² term is a softening
                parameter that prevents numerical singularities when bodies pass very close together.
            
                The simulation supports multiple integration methods. By default, it uses the Velocity Verlet integration method, a symplectic
                integrator that provides superior energy conservation compared to simpler methods like Euler
                integration.
                This makes it ideal for long-term orbital mechanics simulations.
            
                Users can switch to the 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method in the Advanced
                Settings,
                which offers higher accuracy per timestep and typically shows lower energy drift in short simulations.
                However, RK4 is not symplectic and accumulates systematic phase errors over long simulation times,
                causing orbits to gradually decay or expand. This makes RK4 better suited for short to medium duration
                simulations where minimizing instantaneous error is the priority, while Verlet excels at maintaining
                correct orbital shapes over extended periods.

                orbit
                while a third body follows another).

            Energy Conservation & Simulation Accuracy
                The simulator displays two important energy metrics in the Advanced Settings panel:
             The sum of kinetic energy (½mv²) and gravitational potential energy
                    (-Gm₁m₂/r) of all bodies. In an ideal gravitational system, this value should remain constant over
                    time. The percentage change in total energy from the initial state. This
                    measures
                    the numerical accuracy of the simulation.
                In real physics, energy is conserved in isolated systems. However, numerical integration methods
                introduce
                small errors at each timestep. The energy drift indicator helps you evaluate simulation quality:
             Excellent energy conservation - the
                    simulation is highly accurate Moderate drift - acceptable for most
                    purposes but consider reducing timestep Significant drift - simulation may be
                    unreliable, reduce timestep or try other integration methods
                The Velocity Verlet integration method is "symplectic," meaning it preserves the phase-space structure
                of Hamiltonian systems. While RK4 typically shows lower energy drift in short-term simulations (better
                local accuracy), Verlet prevents systematic phase errors that accumulate over extended simulations.
                This makes Verlet ideal for long-term orbital mechanics where maintaining orbital stability over
                thousands of periods is more important than minimizing instantaneous error.
            Why is Total Energy Negative? In gravitational systems, total energy is often negative,
                and this is
                perfectly normal! Gravitational potential energy is defined as zero at infinite separation and becomes
                increasingly
                negative as bodies move closer together (PE = -Gm₁m₂/r). When total energy is negative, it means the
                system is
                 - the bodies don't have enough kinetic energy to escape to infinity, so
                they remain
                in orbit. This is exactly what you see in stable orbital systems like planets around stars or the
                choreographed
                orbits in this simulator. A negative total energy that remains constant indicates a stable, bound
                orbital system.

Fat is not just stored energy, it’s a complex organ that controls crucial hormones and communicates with your brain, immune system, and metabolism. It's one of the most powerful organs, but it can be one of the most dangerous ones, as well. When there’s too much of it, fat can trigger inflammation, disrupt hormonal balance, increase your risk for nearly every major disease, and significantly shorten your life.
What is fat really, and how does it function? When does it become dangerous and can the damage caused by excessive amounts of fat be reversed?

The lawsuit says that people detained at the facility are being held in abhorrent, “inhumane” conditions. The complaint describes a facility where detainees are “confined at Broadview inside overcrowded holding cells containing dozens of people at a time. People are forced to attempt to sleep for days or sometimes weeks on plastic chairs or on the filthy concrete floor. They are denied sufficient food and water […] the temperatures are extreme and uncomfortable […] the physical conditions are filthy, with poor sanitation, clogged toilets, and blood, human fluids, and insects in the sinks and the floor […] federal officers who patrol Broadview under Defendants’ authority are abusive and cruel. Putative class members are routinely degraded, mistreated, and humiliated by these officers.” As part of discovery in the case, the plaintiffs’ lawyers requested surveillance footage from the facility starting from mid September, which is when ICE stepped up its mass deportation campaign in Chicago. In a status report submitted by lawyers from both the plaintiffs and the Department of Homeland Security, lawyers said that nearly two weeks of footage has been “irretrievably destroyed.”“Defendants have agreed to produce. Video from September 28, 2025 to October 19, 2025, and also from October 31, 2025 to November, 7 2025,” the filing states. “Defendants have indicated that some video between October 19, 2025 and October 31, 2025 has been irretrievably destroyed and therefore cannot be produced on an expedited basis or at all.” Law & Crime first reported on the filing.The filing adds that the plaintiffs, who are being represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, the MacArthur Justice Center, and the Eimer Stahl law firm, hired an IT contractor to work with the government “to attempt to work through issues concerning the missing video, including whether any content is able to be retrieved.”Surveillance footage from inside the detention center would presumably be critical in a case about the alleged abusive treatment of detainees and inhumane living conditions. The filing states that the plaintiffs' attorneys have “communicated to Defendants that they are most concerned with obtaining the available surveillance videos as quickly as possible.”ICE did not respond to a request for comment from 404 Media. A spokesperson for the ACLU of Illinois told 404 Media “we don’t have any insight on this. Hoping DHS can explain.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Japan threatens military intervention if China invades Taiwan</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/japan-threatens-military-intervention-if-china-invades-taiwan</link><author>Anja Popp</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 14:31:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A diplomatic feud is worsening between China and Japan – with the defence of Taiwan at the centre of it.Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi threatened to intervene if China invades Taiwan, as large military drills have continued off the Chinese coast and Japan made accusations of intimidation tactics around islands off the coast of both nations.In response to the threat, China has begun telling residents to avoid travel to Japan, sending tourism stocks into a freefall and China is also suspending Japanese film releases in the country.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond the Hype: Real Talk on AI-Assisted Development • Jessica Kerr &amp; Diana Montalion</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrE2cpW4CGQ</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CrE2cpW4CGQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 14:01:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted.

DESCRIPTION
Systems architect Diana Montalion and engineering manager Jessica Kerr cut through the AI coding hype to explore what these tools actually do well - and where they have room for improvement. Moving beyond the "AI will replace developers" narrative, they reveal how AI assistants excel at the tedious work of typing, scaffolding, and error handling while remaining surprisingly bad at the nuanced thinking that experienced developers bring to complex systems.

Their discussion illuminates a more mature relationship with AI tools: one where developers maintain agency over design decisions while leveraging AI's strengths in automation, synthesis, and rapid prototyping. The result is a pragmatic roadmap for using AI to amplify human expertise rather than replace it.

According to the World Economic Forum, it can take on average between four and five generations for a child born into a low-income family to reach their country’s average income. Meanwhile, those born wealthy are likely to stay wealthy and even get richer. 

An Oxfam report found that although global inequality has improved to some degree in the last decades, wealth disparity remains a huge issue.  
A lot of potential talent is lost or remains underdeveloped when people cannot progress in their career or improve their circumstances. Even knowing there's the chance to better your family's financial situation boosts well-being and life satisfaction significantly.

In the tweet, Trump calls for NBC (which is hoping to gain Trump regulatory approval for an acquisition of Warner Brothers) to fire Meyers immediately for the criminal offense of… jokes:That’s Carr posting a screenshot of Donald Trump posting to Truth Social:NBC’s Seth Meyers is suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). He was viewed last night in an uncontrollable rage, likely due to the fact that his “show” is a Ratings DISASTER. Aside from everything else, Meyers has no talent, and NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!Also, the weird thing is that Trump posted on November 15th that he viewed Meyers “last night,” which is impressive since Meyers’ didn’t even have a new show airing on the 14th.So it’s certainly possible that NBC executives could fire Seth Meyers in order to gain regulatory approval of Warner Brothers, but they, of course, won’t t there would be any connection between the two. But even then, it would be quite a gambit with Trump’s popularity cratering. So if they’re keen on making Seth Meyers more popular than ever, they should definitely proceed. The great irony is it’s not like the comedians that most rile the president are even particularly edgy or boundary pushing in literally any way. Most of the stuff that deeply riles our toddler king is pretty basic observational late night comedy. Which makes you wonder how Trump would respond to modern U.S. comedy if it actually had some George Carlin, Richard Pryor, or Lenny Bruce style teeth. Outside of a smattering of light criticism of hackish “anti-woke” comedians by the likes of Anthony Jeselnik, Marc Maron, and the Elephant Graveyard guy, U.S. comedy — much like U.S. media more broadly — has been a feckless mess when it comes to challenging authoritarianism. Which is unfortunate given how even the lightest mainstream jokes about their competency clearly gets under their very thin skin.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You’re not awkward — the world is | The Gray Area</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZT__G650Fk</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XZT__G650Fk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:01:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We all know what awkwardness feels like.

The air gets "stale": humidity often rises above 60 %, which can harm our wellbeing and promote mould. At the same time the CO₂ level in the air increases, which impacts our ability to concentrate. So I built a room air monitor that stays unobtrusive as long as everything is in the green zone, but becomes deliberately noticeable once thresholds are exceeded. For my personal love of statistics I also visualise the measurements in a clear dashboard.
When windows stay closed for longer periods, the air indoors quickly becomes “stale”. Both humidity and the CO₂ level rise. CO₂ is measured in parts per million (ppm) – essentially “CO₂ molecules per one million air molecules”. This makes it easy to compare how much more CO₂ is present indoors compared to fresh outdoor air. At elevated levels, the following issues can occur:Meaning / possible effectsaround 400-450 ppm (typical outdoor air)Often used as an upper limit for good ventilation. Values above ~1 000 ppm indicate insufficient ventilation.Concentration rises – reduced performance, concentration problems and tiredness become more likely.Very poorly ventilated room. Health and comfort issues become more frequent.Extreme values (e.g. > 5 000 ppm)Severe symptoms possible, e.g. shortness of breath or loss of consciousness. Very rare in normal indoor environments. ASHRAE (2022). ASHRAE Position Document on Indoor Carbon Dioxide – PDFHumidity that is too high or too low is also unhealthy. If it is too low, this leads to dry mucous membranes, irritated skin and a higher susceptibility to infections. If it is too high, it promotes mould growth, dust mites and other bio-organisms that can contribute to respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma.Meaning / possible effectsVery dry: irritated mucous membranes, dry skin, eyes, possibly nosebleeds, increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.Often quoted as the lower bound of the “healthy” range.Frequently recommended ideal range for indoor spaces in terms of health and comfort.Risk: increased mould and mite growth, damp rooms, uncomfortable indoor climate.High humidity + poor ventilation = substantial health and building risks (mould, respiratory diseases). 
Wang, W., Zhang, X., & Li, W. (2023). Effects of indoor humidity on human health and comfort: A systematic review. Building and Environment – articleAll of this shows how important regular airing is. The e-paper room air monitor helps my flatmates and me to keep these values in check and maintain a healthy indoor climate.The hardware is intentionally simple – mainly components I already had at home:The e-paper room air monitorThe goal of the e-paper room air monitor is to stay unobtrusive as long as the air quality is within the green range, but to become clearly visible when defined thresholds are exceeded. This is achieved via the LED board, which starts blinking when values reach warning levels. The e-paper display always shows the current air quality plus a short recommendation of what to do.The dashboard is there to help us understand how air quality develops over time and to keep us motivated to improve it. It shows interactive charts and a few easy-to-interpret metrics. The dashboard is meant to be a gentle nudge to keep an eye on indoor air quality in the long run. Here is a small preview:Actively opening the dashboard and looking at graphs is a conscious decision that is easy to forget in everyday life. To counter that, I built a Telegram bot that posts a short summary of the previous day every morning at 7 a.m. into our flat’s group chat. This helps raise awareness and makes it easier to improve air quality habits.In the second part of this blog series I want to dive deeper into the code and the implementation and talk about the challenges I ran into. I also plan to make the GitHub repository public by then, so interested readers can study the code, propose improvements or build their own version of the e-paper room air monitor.The GitHub repository is not public yet. I will open it at the latest when part 2 of this series is published.If you find the project interesting and would like to contribute, here are a few ideas:Contribute to the code in the GitHub repository (once it is public).Do you have a 3D printer and experience designing 3D objects?
    I would love a nice case design for the e-paper room air monitor.Do you have ideas for additional sensors?
    Leave a comment and/or sponsor a sensor.Do you have hints, feedback or general comments?

A couple of things are true. First, an entity risks losing their marks if they don’t rigorously enforce them against  infringement. Second, the USPTO is far too lenient in granting marks that are non-creative or which contain very basic characters, like individual letters and numbers. And, third, the results of this are company lawyers suing or opposing trademark applications in a manner that ultimately looks very, very silly.Arena Football One is a league that has existed for about a year. The small league kicked off its inaugural season in 2024, shortly after filing for trademarks on its names and logo, the latter of which is “AF1”, with the “A” styled to have a football in the center of it. And then Formula 1 came calling.On Oct. 3, Formula 1, which is a popular international auto racing league, filed a “Notice of Opposition” before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board against Arena Football One. F1’s grounds for appeal against AF1 include, “likelihood of confusion,” and “likelihood of dilution.”“The [AF1] Services are entertainment services related to sports, which are highly related to the entertainment services offered by the Formula 1 Companies under the F1 Marks and covered by the F1 Registrations… The Applicant’s Mark encompasses in its entirety the Opposer’s F1 word mark and the ‘F1’ element is identical in sight, sound and commercial impression, and is highly similar to the F1 Marks overall. Both marks are pronounced similarly: ‘A-F-One” and ‘F-One.’ They share the dominant, final sound element “F-One.” The initial “A” in “AF1” is likely to be perceived as a minor variation or prefix, making the marks phonetically very close.” Attorneys for F1 stated in the appeal.Likelihood of confusion is simply not on offer here. This is where the nuance of trademark law comes into play. It’s not enough for marks to be similar to allege confusion. They also have to, upon examination, exhibit a likelihood of confusion among the hurried morons of the world. I’m simply going to put F1’s and AF1’s logos side by side below for you and let you decide for yourself just how confusing they are.I’m sorry, but no. The logos aren’t that similar, they use different color combinations, there’s a football in the AF1 logo, as well as the league’s goddamned name. Unless we’re arguing now that morons in a hurry can’t even read basic English words, then there is no confusion to be had here. And I myself am a “moron” when it comes to both F1 racing and arena football in the sense that I don’t know or care about either of them. If someone came up to me and asked if I wanted AF1 tickets, I would ask them what the hell they were talking about, not what time the race is. All the more-so if they called it “Arena Football One,” a name that F1 also opposed.I suppose what they’re going for here on the dilution claim is dilution by blurring, meaning that F1’s famous mark will be weakened in strength of association with its product due to the similarities with AF1’s. I’m going to go ahead and call bullshit on that one, too. F1 has a handful of races in the United States, sure, but Arena Football One is a relatively small and obscure sports league. I would love to see a shred of evidence for true dilution due to its name and logo by F1. I have to believe the effects of AF1 existing on F1 are essentially non-existent. And, keep in mind, dilution is typically more challenging to prove, as you have to show it actually occurring.Both Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch have also filed for extensions to oppose the marks. Those seem to make even less sense than the F1 opposition. I have no idea what Nike could be citing in opposition, but is Abercrombie & Fitch really going to suggest that it’s products are going to be confused with an arena football game?So much of this sort of thing feels like attorneys filing oppositions for the sake of oppositions. And none of it appears designed to actually protect the consumer, which is supposed to be the point of trademark law.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friendsgiving, explained</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0WGFTfrr1k</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/j0WGFTfrr1k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 03:56:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanksgiving is arguably one of the yummiest celebrations in the US and one where you’re expected to be home for the holidays. But, what are your options when going home isn’t one? In recent decades, Friendsgiving has emerged as the go-to choice as an additional event or complete alternative to Thanksgiving. 

It can be tough during the holidays with the pressures of trying to get everything just right to present yourself as a well-adjusted adult hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, or to be present with family that may think they know what’s  best for you. Friendsgiving has opened the door to do things a little bit differently. The intention is to have a laid-back, low-pressure (or over-the-top, totally up to the host) potluck-style dinner with friends and other people in your chosen community — because as cheesy as it sounds, friends are the new family. 

Friendsgiving was seemingly plucked from obscurity in the 2010s. While its exact origins are debated, it was likely widely practiced prior to its fame on The Real Housewives of New Jersey in 2011. Even then it took a few more years for it to pick up steam in the media. 

Watch this video to learn how Friendsgiving went from a friendly potluck dinner to a cultural mainstay.

in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) for the second time. Almost twenty contributors have been working very hard on their projects for several months. Same as last year, the projects had various durations, so some of them have ended in September, while the last ones have been concluded in the middle of November. Now that the final reports of all projects have been submitted, we are happy to announce that 18 out of 19 projects have been successful! We had a very large number of projects this year, so we consider this number of successfully finished projects to be a great result.We had awesome interactions with our GSoC contributors over the summer, and through a video call, we also had a chance to see each other and discuss the accepted GSoC projects. Our contributors have learned a lot of new things and collaborated with us on making Rust better for everyone, and we are very grateful for all their contributions! Some of them have even continued contributing after their project has ended, and we hope to keep working with them in the future, to further improve open-source Rust software. We would like to thank all our Rust GSoC 2025 contributors. You did a great job!Same as last year, Google Summer of Code 2025 was overall a success for the Rust Project, this time with more than double the number of projects. We think that GSoC is a great way of introducing new contributors to our community, and we are looking forward to participating in GSoC (or similar programs) again in the near future. If you are interested in becoming a (GSoC) contributor, check out our GSoC project idea list and our guide for new contributors.Below you can find a brief summary of our GSoC 2025 projects. You can find more information about the original goals of the projects here. For easier navigation, here is an index of the project descriptions in alphabetical order:And now strap in, as there is a ton of great content to read about here!
ABI/Layout handling for the automatic differentiation featureThe  module allows computing gradients and derivatives in the calculus sense. It provides two autodiff macros, which can be applied to user-written functions and automatically generate modified versions of those functions, which also compute the requested gradients and derivatives. This functionality is very useful especially in the context of scientific computing and implementation of machine-learning models.Our autodiff frontend was facing two challenges.First, we would generate a new function through our macro expansion, however, we would not have a suitable function body for it yet. Our autodiff implementation relies on an LLVM plugin to generate the function body. However, this plugin only gets called towards the end of the compilation pipeline. Earlier optimization passes, either on the LLVM or the Rust side, could look at the placeholder body and either "optimize" or even delete the function since it has no clear purpose yet.Second, the flexibility of our macros was causing issues, since it allows requesting derivative computations on a per-argument basis. However, when we start to lower Rust arguments to our compiler backends like LLVM, we do not always have a 1:1 match of Rust arguments to LLVM arguments. As a simple example, an array with two double values might be passed as two individual double values on LLVM level, whereas an array with three doubles might be passed via a pointer.Marcelo helped rewrite our  macros to not generate hacky placeholder function bodies, but instead introduced a proper  intrinsic. This is the proper way for us to declare that an implementation of this function is not available yet and will be provided later in the compilation pipeline. As a consequence, our generated functions were not deleted or incorrectly optimized anymore. The intrinsic PR also allowed removing some previous hacks and therefore reduced the total lines of code in the Rust compiler by over 500! You can find more details in this PR.Beyond autodiff work, Marcelo also initiated work on GPU offloading intrinsics, and helped with multiple bugs in our argument handling. We would like to thank Marcelo for all his great work!The Rust Project has an ambitious goal to instrument the Rust standard library with safety contracts, moving from informal comments that specify safety requirements of  functions to executable Rust code. This transformation represents a significant step toward making Rust's safety guarantees more explicit and verifiable. To prioritize which functions should receive contracts first, there is a verification contest ongoing.Given that Rust contracts are still in their early stages, Dawid's project was intentionally open-ended in scope and direction. This flexibility allowed Dawid to identify and tackle several key areas that would add substantial value to the contracts ecosystem. His contributions were in the following three main areas:Pragmatic Contracts Integration: Refactoring contract HIR lowering to ensure no contract code is executed when contract-checks are disabled. This has major impact as it ensures that contracts do not have runtime cost when contract checks are disabled.Variable Reference Capability: Adding the ability to refer to variables from preconditions within postconditions. This fundamental enhancement to the contracts system has been fully implemented and merged into the compiler. This feature provides developers with much more expressive power when writing contracts, allowing them to establish relationships between input and output states.Separation Logic Integration: The bulk of Dawid's project involved identifying, understanding, and planning the introduction of owned and block ownership predicates for separation-logic style reasoning in contracts for unsafe Rust code. This work required extensive research and collaboration with experts in the field. Dawid engaged in multiple discussions with authors of Rust validation tools and Miri developers, both in person and through Zulip discussion threads. The culmination of this research is captured in a comprehensive MCP (Major Change Proposal) that Dawid created.Dawid's work represents crucial foundational progress for Rust's safety contracts initiative. By successfully implementing variable reference capabilities and laying the groundwork for separation logic integration, he has positioned the contracts feature for significant future development. His research and design work will undoubtedly influence the direction of this important safety feature as it continues to mature. Thank you very much!
Bootstrap of rustc with rustc_codegen_gccThe goal of this project was to improve the Rust GCC codegen backend (), so that it would be able to compile the "stage 2" Rust compiler () itself again.You might remember that Michał already participated in GSoC last year, where he was working on his own .NET Rust codegen backend, and he did an incredible amount of work. This year, his progress was somehow even faster. Even before the official GSoC implementation period started (!), he essentially completed his original project goal and managed to build  with GCC. This was no small feat, as he had to investigate and fix several miscompilations that occurred when functions marked with  were called recursively or when the compiled program was trying to work with 128-bit integers. You can read more about this initial work at his blog.After that, he immediately started working on stretch goals of his project. The first one was to get a "stage-3"  build working, for which he had to vastly improve the memory consumption of the codegen backend.Once that was done, he moved on to yet another goal, which was to build  for a platform not supported by LLVM. He made progress on this for Dec Alpha and m68k. He also attempted to compile  on Aarch64, which led to him finding an ABI bug. Ultimately, he managed to build a  for m68k (with a few workarounds that we will need to fix in the future). That is a very nice first step to porting Rust to new platforms unsupported by LLVM, and is important for initiatives such as Rust for Linux.Michał had to spend a lot of time starting into assembly code and investigating arcane ABI problems. In order to make this easier for everyone, he implemented support for fuzzing and automatically checking ABI mismatches in the GCC codegen backend. You can read more about his testing and fuzzing efforts here.We were really impressed with what Michał was able to achieve, and we really appreciated working with him this summer. Thank you for all your work, Michał!
Cargo: Build script delegationCargo build scripts come at a compile-time cost, because even to run , they must be built as if you ran , so that they can be executed during compilation. Even though we try to identify ways to reduce the need to write build scripts in the first place, that may not always be doable. However, if we could shift build scripts from being defined in every package that needs them, into a few core build script packages, we could both reduce the compile-time overhead, and also improve their auditability and transparency. You can find more information about this idea here.The first step required to delegate build scripts to packages is to be able to run multiple build scripts per crate, so that is what Naman was primarily working on. He introduced a new unstable  feature to Cargo, implemented support for parsing an array of build scripts in , and extended Cargo so that it can now execute multiple build scripts while building a single crate. He also added a set of tests to ensure that this feature will work as we expect it to.Then he worked on ensuring that the execution of builds scripts is performed in a deterministic order, and that crates can access the output of each build script separately. For example, if you have the following configuration:then the corresponding crate is able to access the s of both build scripts using env!("windows-manifest_OUT_DIR") and env!("release-info_OUTDIR").As future work, we would like to implement the ability to pass parameters to build scripts through metadata specified in  and then implement the actual build script delegation to external build scripts using artifact-dependencies.We would like to thank Naman for helping improving Cargo and laying the groundwork for a feature that could have compile-time benefits across the Rust ecosystem!
Distributed and resource-efficient verificationThe goal of this project was to address critical scalability challenges of formally verifying Rust's standard library by developing a distributed verification system that intelligently manages computational resources and minimizes redundant work. The Rust standard library verification project faces significant computational overhead when verifying large codebases, as traditional approaches re-verify unchanged code components. With Rust's standard library containing thousands of functions and continuous development cycles, this inefficiency becomes a major bottleneck for practical formal verification adoption.Jiping implemented a distributed verification system with several key innovations:Intelligent Change Detection: The system uses hash-based analysis to identify which parts of the codebase have actually changed, allowing verification to focus only on modified components and their dependencies.: The project coordinates multiple verification backends including Kani model checker, with careful version pinning and compatibility management.: The verification workload is distributed across multiple compute nodes, with intelligent scheduling that considers both computational requirements and dependency graphs.: Jiping built a comprehensive web interface that provides live verification status, interactive charts, and detailed proof results. You can check it out here!You can find the created distributed verification tool in this repository. Jiping's work established a foundation for scalable formal verification that can adapt to the growing complexity of Rust's ecosystem, while maintaining verification quality and completeness, which will go a long way towards ensuring that Rust's standard library remains safe and sound. Thank you for your great work!
Enable Witness Generation in cargo-semver-checks is a Cargo subcommand for finding SemVer API breakages in Rust crates. Talyn's project aimed to lay the groundwork for it to tackle our most vexing limitation: the inability to catch SemVer breakage due to type changes.Imagine a crate makes the following change to its public API:This is  a major breaking change, right? And yet  with its hundreds of lints is  unable to flag this. While this case seems trivial, it's just the tip of an enormous iceberg. Instead of changing  to , what if the change was from  to , or worse, into some monstrosity like:Figuring out whether this change is breaking requires checking whether the original  parameter type can "fit" into that monstrosity of an  type. But reimplementing a Rust type checker and trait solver inside  is out of the question! Instead, we turn to a technique created for a previous study of SemVer breakage on crates.io—we generate a "witness" program that will fail to compile if, and only if, there's a breaking change between the two versions.The witness program is a separate crate that can be made to depend on either the old or the new version of the crate being scanned. If our  function comes from a crate called , its witness program would look something like:This example is cherry-picked to be easy to understand. Witness programs are rarely this straightforward!Attempting to  the witness while plugging in the new version of  forces  to decide whether  matches the new  parameter. If  passes without errors, there's no breaking change here. But if there's a compilation error, then this is concrete, incontrovertible evidence of breakage!Over the past 22+ weeks, Talyn worked tirelessly to move this from an idea to a working proof of concept. For every problem we foresaw needing to solve, ten more emerged along the way. Talyn did a lot of design work to figure out an approach that would be able to deal with crates coming from various sources (crates.io, a path on disk, a git revision), would support multiple rustdoc JSON formats for all the hundreds of existing lints, and do so in a fashion that doesn't get in the way of adding hundreds more lints in the future.Even the above list of daunting challenges fails to do justice to the complexity of this project. Talyn created a witness generation prototype that lays the groundwork for robust checking of type-related SemVer breakages in the future. The success of this work is key to the  roadmap for 2026 and beyond. We would like to thank Talyn for their work, and we hope to continue working with them on improving witness generation in the future.
Extend behavioural testing of std::arch intrinsicsThe  module contains target-specific intrinsics (low-level functions that typically correspond to single machine instructions) which are intended to be used by other libraries. These are intended to match the equivalent intrinsics available as vendor-specific extensions in C.The intrinsics are tested with three approaches. We test that:The signatures of the intrinsics match the one specified by the architecture.The intrinsics generate the correct instruction.The intrinsics have the correct runtime behavior.These behavior tests are implemented in the intrinsics-test crate. Initially, this test framework only covered the AArch64 and AArch32 targets, where it was very useful in finding bugs in the implementation of the intrinsics. Madhav's project was about refactoring and improving this framework to make it easier (or really, possible) to extend it to other CPU architectures.First, Madhav split the codebase into a module with shared (architecturally independent) code and a module with ARM-specific logic. Then he implemented support for testing intrinsics for the x86 architecture, which is Rust's most widely used target. In doing so, he allowed us to discover real bugs in the implementation of some intrinsics, which is a great result! Madhav also did a lot of work in optimizing how the test suite is compiled and executed, to reduce CI time needed to run tests, and he laid the groundwork for supporting even more architectures, specifically LoongArch and WebAssembly.We would like to thank Madhav for all his work on helping us make sure that Rust intrinsics are safe and correct!
Implement merge functionality in borsThe main Rust repository uses a pull request merge queue bot that we call . Its current Python implementation has a lot of issues and was difficult to maintain. The goal of this GSoC project was thus to implement the primary merge queue functionality in our Rust rewrite of this bot.Sakibul first examined the original Python codebase to figure out what it was doing, and then he implemented several bot commands that allow contributors to approve PRs, set their priority, delegate approval rights, temporarily close the merge tree, and many others. He also implemented an asynchronous background process that checks whether a given pull request is mergeable or not (this process is relatively involved, due to how GitHub works), which required implementing a specialized synchronized queue for deduplicating mergeability check requests to avoid overloading the GitHub API. Furthermore, Sakibul also reimplemented (a nicer version of) the merge queue status webpage that can be used to track which pull requests are currently being tested on CI, which ones are approved, etc.After the groundwork was prepared, Sakibul could work on the merge queue itself, which required him to think about many tricky race conditions and edge cases to ensure that bors doesn't e.g. merge the wrong PR into the default branch or merge a PR multiple times. He covered these edge cases with many integration tests, to give us more confidence that the merge queue will work as we expect it to, and also prepared a script for creating simulated PRs on a test GitHub repository so that we can test bors "in the wild". And so far, it seems to be working very well!After we finish the final piece of the merge logic (creating so-called "rollups") together with Sakibul, we will start using bors fully in the main Rust repository. Sakibul's work will thus be used to merge all  pull requests. Exciting!Apart from working on the merge queue, Sakibul made many other awesome contributions to the codebase, like refactoring the test suite or analyzing performance of SQL queries. In total, Sakibul sent around fifty pull requests that were already merged into bors! What can we say, other than: Awesome work Sakibul, thank you!bootstrap is the build system of Rust itself, which is responsible for building the compiler, standard library, and pretty much everything else that you can download through . This project's goal was very open-ended: "improve bootstrap".And Shourya did just that! He made meaningful contributions to several parts of bootstrap. First, he added much-needed documentation to several core bootstrap data structures and modules, which were quite opaque and hard to understand without any docs. Then he moved to improving command execution, as each bootstrap invocation invokes hundreds of external binaries, and it was difficult to track them. Shourya finished a long-standing refactoring that routes almost all executed commands through a single place. This allowed him to also implement command caching and also command profiling, which shows us which commands are the slowest.After that, Shourya moved on to refactoring config parsing. This was no easy task, because bootstrap has A LOT of config options; the single  that parses them had over a thousand lines of code (!). A set of complicated config precedence rules was frequently causing bugs when we had to modify that function. It took him several weeks to untangle this mess, but the result is worth it. The refactored function is much less brittle and easier to understand and modify, which is great for future maintenance.The final area that Shourya improved were bootstrap tests. He made it possible to run them using bare , which enables debugging them e.g. in an IDE, which is very useful, and mainly he found a way to run the tests in parallel, which makes contributing to bootstrap itself much more pleasant, as it reduced the time to execute the tests from a minute to under ten seconds. These changes required refactoring many bootstrap tests that were using global state, which was not compatible with parallel execution.Overall, Shourya made more than 30 PRs to bootstrap since April! We are very thankful for all his contributions, as they made bootstrap much easier to maintain. Thank you!
Improve Wild linker test suitesWild is a very fast linker for Linux that’s written in Rust. It can be used to build executables and shared objects.Kei’s project was to leverage the test suite of one of the other Linux linkers to help test the Wild linker. This goal was accomplished. Thanks to Kei’s efforts, we now run the Mold test suite against Wild in our CI. This has helped to prevent regressions on at least a couple of occasions and has also helped to show places where Wild has room for improvement.In addition to this core work, Kei also undertook numerous other changes to Wild during GSoC. Of particular note was the reworking of argument parsing to support , which we had wanted for some time. Kei also fixed a number of bugs and implemented various previously missing features. This work has helped to expand the range of projects that can use Wild to build executables.Kei has continued to contribute to Wild even after the GSoC project finished and has now contributed over seventy PRs. We thank Kei for all the hard work and look forward to continued collaboration in the future!
Improving the Rustc Parallel Frontend: Parallel Macro ExpansionThe Rust compiler has a (currently unstable) parallel compilation mode in which some compiler passes run in parallel.
One major part of the compiler that is not yet affected by parallelization is name resolution.
It has several components, but those selected for this GSoC project were import resolution and macro expansion (which are in fact intermingled into a single fixed-point algorithm).
Besides the parallelization itself, another important point of the work was improving the correctness of import resolution by eliminating accidental order dependencies in it, as those also prevent parallelization.We should note that this was a  ambitious project, and we knew from the beginning that it would likely be quite challenging to reach the end goal within the span of just a few months. And indeed, Lorrens did in fact run into several unexpected issues that showed us that the complexity of this work is well beyond a single GSoC project, so he didn't actually get to parallelizing the macro expansion algorithm. Nevertheless, he did a lot of important work to improve the name resolver and prepare it for being parallelized.The first thing that Lorrens had to do was actually understand how Rust name resolution works and how it is implemented in the compiler. That is, to put it mildly, a  piece of logic, and is affected by legacy burden in the form of backward compatibility lints, outdated naming conventions, and other technical debt. Even this learned knowledge itself is incredibly useful, as the set of people that understand Rust's name resolution today is very low, so it is important to grow it.Using this knowledge, he made a lot of refactorings to separate  mutability in name resolver data structures from "cache-like" mutability used for things like lazily loading otherwise immutable data from extern crates, which was needed to unblock parallelization work. He split variousparts of the name resolver, got rid of unnecessarymutability and performed a bunch of otherrefactorings. He also had to come up with a very tricky data structure that allows providing conditional mutable access to some data.These refactorings allowed him to implement something called "batched import resolution", which splits unresolved imports in the crate into "batches", where all imports in a single batch can be resolved independently and potentially in parallel, which is crucial for parallelizing name resolution. We have to resolve a few remaining language compatibilityissues, after which the batched import resolution work will hopefully be merged.Lorrens laid an important groundwork for fixing potential correctness issues around name resolution and macro expansion, which unblocks further work on parallelizing these compiler passes, which is exciting. His work also helped unblock some libraryimprovements that were stuck for a long time. We are grateful for your hard work on improving tricky parts of Rust and its compiler, Lorrens. Thank you!
Make cargo-semver-checks faster is a Cargo subcommand for finding SemVer API breakages in Rust crates. It is adding SemVer lints at an  pace: the number of lints has been doubling every year, and currently stands at . More lints mean more work for  to do, as well as more work for its test suite which runs over 250000 lint checks!Joseph's contributions took three forms:Improving  runtime performance—on large crates, our query runtime went from ~8s to ~2s, a 4x improvement!Improving the test suite's performance, enabling us to iterate faster. Our test suite used to take ~7min and now finishes in ~1min, a 7x improvement!Improving our ability to profile query performance and inspect performance anomalies, both of which were proving a bottleneck for our ability to ship further improvements.Joseph described all the clever optimization tricks leading to these results in his final report. To encourage you to check out the post, we'll highlight a particularly elegant optimization described there. relies on rustdoc JSON, an unstable component of Rust whose output format often has breaking changes. Since each release of  supports a range of Rust versions, it must also support a range of rustdoc JSON formats. Fortunately, each file carries a version number that tells us which version's  types to use to deserialize the data.Previously, we used to deserialize the JSON file twice: once with a  type that only loaded the  field, and a second time with the appropriate  type that matches the format. This works fine, but many large crates generate rustdoc JSON files that are 500 MiB+ in size, requiring us to walk all that data twice. While  is quite fast, there's nothing as fast as  doing the work twice in the first place!So we used a trick:  check if the  field is the last field in the JSON file, which happens to be the case every time (even though it is not guaranteed). Rather than parsing JSON, we merely look for a  character in the last few dozen bytes, then look for  after the  character, and for  between them. If this is successful, we've discovered the version number while avoiding going through hundreds of MB of data! If we failed for any reason, we just fall back to the original approach having only wasted the effort of looking at 20ish extra bytes.Joseph did a lot of profiling and performance optimizations to make  faster for everyone, with awesome results. Thank you very much for your work!As a very important part of the Rustup team's vision of migrating the rustup codebase to using async IO since the introduction of the global  runtime in #3367, this project's goal was to introduce proper concurrency to rustup. Francisco did that by attacking two aspects of the codebase at once:He created a new set of user interfaces for displaying concurrent progress.He implemented a new toolchain update checking & installation flow that is idiomatically concurrent.As a warmup, Francisco made  concurrent, resulting in a rather easy 3x performance boost in certain cases. Along the way, he also introduced a new indicatif-based progress bar for reporting progress of concurrent operations, which replaced the original hand-rolled solution.After that, the focus of the project has moved on to the toolchain installation flow used in commands like  and . In this part, Francisco developed two main improvements:The possibility of downloading multiple components at once when setting up a toolchain, controlled by the RUSTUP_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS environment variable. Setting this variable to a value greater than 1 is particularly useful in certain internet environments where the speed of a single download connection could be restricted by QoS (Quality of Service) limits.The ability to interleave component network downloads and disk unpacking. For the moment, unpacking will still happen sequentially, but disk and net I/O can finally be overlapped! This introduces a net gain in toolchain installation time, as only the last component being downloaded will have noticeable unpacking delays. In our tests, this typically results in a reduction of 4-6 seconds (on fast connections, that's ~33% faster!) when setting up a toolchain with the  profile.We have to say that these results are very impressive! While a few seconds shorter toolchain installation might not look so important at a first glance, rustup is ubiquitously used to install Rust toolchains on CI of tens of thousands of Rust projects, so this improvement (and also further improvements that it unlocks) will have an enormous effect across the Rust ecosystem. Many thanks to Francisco Gouveia's enthusiasm and active participation, without which this wouldn't have worked out!
Mapping the Maze of Rust's UI Test Suite with Established Continuous Integration PracticesThe snapshot-based UI test suite is a crucial part of the Rust compiler's test suite. It contains  of tests: over 19000 at the time of writing. The organization of this test suite is thus
very important, for at least two reasons:We want to be able to find specific tests, identify related tests, and have some sort of logical grouping of related tests.We have to ensure that no directory contains so many entries such that GitHub gives up rendering the directory.Furthermore, having informative test names and having some context for each test is particularly important, as otherwise contributors would have to reverse-engineer test intent from  and friends.Over the years, we have accumulated a lot of unorganized stray test files in the
top level  directory, and have a lot of generically named 
tests in the  directory. The former makes it annoying to find
more meaningful subdirectories, while the latter makes it completely non-obvious
what each test is about.Julien's project was about introducing some order into the chaos. And that was indeed achieved!
Through Julien's efforts (in conjunction with efforts from other contributors), we now have:No more stray tests under the immediate  top-level directory, and are organized into more meaningful subdirectories. We were able to then introduce a style check to prevent new stray tests from being added.A top-level document contains TL;DRs for each of the immediate subdirectories.Substantially fewer generically-named under .Test organization (and more generally, test suite ergonomics) is an often under-
appreciated aspect of maintaining complex codebases. Julien spent a lot of effort
improving test ergonomics of the Rust compiler, both in last year's GSoC (where he vastly
improved our "run-make" test suite), and then again this year, where he made our UI test suite more ergonomic.
We would like to appreciate your meticulous work, Julien! Thank you very much.
Modernising the libc Crate is a crucial crate in the Rust ecosystem (on average, it has ~1.5 million  downloads), providing bindings to system C API. This GSoC project had two goals: improve testing for what we currently have, and make progress toward a stable 1.0 release of .Test generation is handled by the  crate, which creates unit tests that compare properties of Rust API to properties of the C interfaces it binds. Prior to the project,  used an obsolete Rust parser that had stopped receiving major updates about eight years ago, meaning  could not easily use any syntax newer than that. Abdul completely rewrote  to use  as its parser and make it much easier to add new tests, then went through and switched everything over to the more modern . After this change, we were able to remove a number of hacks that had been needed to work with the old parser.The other part of the project was to make progress toward the 1.0 release of . Abdul helped with this by going through and addressing a number of issues that need to be resolved before the release, many of which were made possible with all the  changes.While there is still a lot of work left to do before  can reach 1.0, Abdul's improvements will go a long way towards making that work easier, as they give us more confidence in the test suite, which is now much easier to modify and extend. Thank you very much for all your work!
Prepare stable_mir crate for publishingThis project's goal was to prepare the Rust compiler's 
crate (eventually renamed to ), which provides a way to interface
with the Rust compiler for analyzing Rust code, for publication on crates.io. While the
existing crate provided easier APIs for tool developers, it lacked proper
versioning and was tightly coupled with compiler versions. The goal was to
enable independent publication with semantic versioning.The main technical work involved restructuring  and 
(previously named ) by inverting their dependency relationship.
Makai resolved circular dependencies by temporarily merging the crates and
gradually separating them with the new architecture. They also split the existing
compiler interface to separate public APIs from internal compiler details.Furthermore, Makai established infrastructure for dual maintenance: keeping an internal
version in the Rust repository to track compiler changes while developing
the publishable version in a dedicated repository. Makai automated a
system to coordinate between versions, and developed custom tooling to validate
compiler version compatibility and to run tests.Makai successfully completed the core refactoring and infrastructure
setup, making it possible to publish  independently with proper
versioning support for the Rust tooling ecosystem! As a bonus, Makai contributed
several bug fixes and implemented new APIs that had been requested by the
community. Great job Makai!
Prototype an alternative architecture for cargo fix using cargo checkThe  command applies fixes suggested by lints, which makes it useful for cleaning up sloppy code,
reducing the annoyance of toolchain upgrades when lints change and helping with edition migrations and new lint adoption. However, it has a number of issues. It can be slow, it only applies a subset of possible lints, and doesn't provide an easy way to select which lints to fix.These problems are caused by its current architecture; it is implemented as a variant of  that replaces  with  being run in a special mode that will call  in a loop, applying fixes until there are none. While this special -proxy mode is running,
a cross-process lock is held to force only one build target to be fixed at a time to avoid race conditions.
This ensures correctness at the cost of performance and difficulty in making the -proxy interactive.Glen implemented a proof of concept of an alternative design called cargo-fixit.  spawns  in a loop, determining which build targets are safe to fix in a given pass, and then applying the suggestions. This puts the top-level program in charge of what fixes get applied, making it easier to coordinate. It also allows the locking to be removed and opens the door to an interactive mode.Glen performed various benchmarks to test how the new approach performs.  And in some benchmarks,  was able to finish within a few hundred milliseconds, where before the same task took  almost a minute! As always, there are trade-offs; the new approach comes at the cost that fixes in packages lower in the dependency tree can cause later packages to be rebuilt multiple times, slowing things down, so there were also benchmarks where the old design was a bit faster. The initial results are still very promising and impressive!Further work remains to be done on  to investigate how it could be optimized better and how should its interface look like before being stabilized. We thank Glen for all the hard work on this project, and we hope that one day the new design will become used by default in Cargo, to bring faster and more flexible fixing of lint suggestions to everyone!The goal of this project was to move forward our Project Goal for creating low-level ("plumbing") Cargo subcommands to make it easier to reuse parts of Cargo by other tools.Vito created a prototype of several plumbing commands in the cargo-plumbing crate. The idea was to better understand how the plumbing commands should look like, and what is needed from Cargo to implement them. Vito had to make compromises in some of these commands to not be blocked on making changes to the current Cargo Rust APIs, and he helpfully documented those blockers. For example, instead of solely relying on the manifests that the user passed in, the plumbing commands will re-read the manifests within each command, preventing callers from being able to edit them to get specific behavior out of Cargo, e.g. dropping all workspace members to allow resolving dependencies on a per-package basis.Vito did a lot of work, as he implemented seven different plumbing subcommands:As future work, we would like to deal with some unresolved questions around how to integrate these plumbing commands within Cargo itself, and extend the set of plumbing commands.We thank Vito for all his work on improving the flexibility of Cargo.We would like to thank all contributors that have participated in Google Summer of Code 2025 with us! It was a blast, and we cannot wait to see which projects GSoC contributors will come up with in the next year. We would also like to thank Google for organizing the Google Summer of Code program and for allowing us to have so many projects this year. And last, but not least, we would like to thank all the Rust mentors who were tirelessly helping our contributors to complete their projects. Without you, Rust GSoC would not be possible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Parqeye – A CLI tool to visualize and inspect Parquet files</title><link>https://github.com/kaushiksrini/parqeye</link><author>kaushiksrini</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:45:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built a Rust-based CLI/terminal UI for inspecting Parquet files—data, metadata, and row-group-level structure—right from the terminal.

    Being able to play games on your homebrew operating system is a big milestone to strive for. It shows that the system has enough implemented for a graphical application to run and get input, that it is fast enough for a game to be playable and that it is stable enough for the game to be played. Usually, the game of choice is Doom, as it has the reputation of being ported to everything under the sun, as well as being an FPS game that can demonstrate all of the points above about your operating system.
    Astral currently has some working game ports, which include Doom and Quake. However, as the capabilities of the operating system grow, so will the complexity of the games that can be played. I have been meaning to add a new game port for a while now, and I eventually decided on a game I had played a lot when I was younger: Minecraft.The challenges of running Minecraft
    Minecraft is *not* an easy game to run. It is written in Java, so you need a working JVM. It uses OpenGL, so you also need a working OpenGL implementation. Additionally, it depends on many different Java libraries that you also have to port. Astral has had OpenJDK 17 and Mesa ported for a while now. The Mesa port works perfectly, but the OpenJDK port ended up bit-rotting and eventually stopped working due to a bug in mlibc.Choosing a version to run
    The first step of this process was choosing which Minecraft version would run in Astral and then figuring out the Java command used to start it. I needed something simple and with as few dependencies as possible, so I picked version Alpha 1.2.0. This version only has one dependency, LWJGL2, reducing porting time and making debugging easier later on.Getting the JVM to work again

  The next step was getting OpenJDK working in Astral again. As I mentioned earlier, it had bit-rotted and was now suffering from a segmentation fault when starting. The OpenJDK stack trace had given some important information: it was happening in  after OpenJDK called  with a big  specifier which had almost every value from 0 to 255.
  I eventually figured out that, due to the mlibc code using the  value from the format string, the values above 127 passed by OpenJDK would be handled as negative integers, which ended up causing accesses to negative array indexes and stack corruption. With this fixed,  was able to run without issue, and I was ready to move on to the next part of this project.LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) is a Java library that is used to create cross-platform games in Java, providing access to APIs like OpenGL and abstractions for things like input. Up until Minecraft release 1.12, LWJGL 2 was used, which is no longer maintained as LWJGL 3 has been released. The version of Minecraft that will be run is Alpha 1.2.0, so LWJGL 2 will need to be ported.
  The process of porting LWJGL2 was quite painful. This mostly involved adding instructions to cross-compile the native libraries for Astral. LWJGL uses Apache Ant as the build system, which I have found to be very hostile to cross-compilation. Most of the patching effort was in the build system, as I did not need to modify any native C code and the only modification to Java code was adding Astral to the list of known OSes. You can find the patch file here, if you are interested.Running Minecraft and Debugging

With LWJGL ported, all that was left to do was boot Astral and debug any problems that end up happening. During this process, I was joined by Dennis Bonke, who maintains Managarm's ports collection. We worked together so we could eventually get Minecraft running on Managarm as well.
To start minecraft I made a simple shell script. It switches to the directory where LWJGL is installed and calls java with all the nescessary arguments for it to start up. This is the version of the script that first got a working Minecraft:/usr/lib/jvm/java-17/bin/java -Xint -Xmx1g -Djava.library.path="/usr/share/lwjgl" -cp "lwjgl.jar:lwjgl_util.jar:/home/astral/minecraft.jar" net.minecraft.client.Minecraft
  In the first attempt, Java would run for a bit and then exit and mlibc would log about a missing  symbol. This is a symbol needed by  and defined by . Looking at rtld logs,  did get loaded by  (twice!), which means that there must have been a bug with mlibc. Eventually, we narrowed it down to the fact that OpenJDK first runs  for  with  and then again with , and the mlibc shared object promotion code was broken for this case. After fixing this, we actually got a window out of Minecraft!

However, it is clear it is still not working. The crash is an LWJGL error talking about an unknown platform. This was a missing piece of code in the LWJGL patch and was quick to fix. Next run, it went further but crashed with another missing symbol, . We figured out this was a symbol that is not present in modern OpenJDK versions so this was clearly an issue with the cross-compilation.
This was a simple but annoying fix, I had to add specific variables to the  XML in LWJGL to make cross compilation easier and to use the proper headers, as it was still trying to use the host OpenJDK 8 headers. Now, LWJGL actually got further! Running it again, we hit another issue: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException while initializing the display.

Diving into the LWJGL source code, we eventually figured out that the issue was in the  class  function, as the exception Seek not possible (ESPIPE) was happening while populating the screen hashmap. After adding a print to get the backtrace, we ended up at the native OpenJDK function , which returns the number of bytes left to read in a file. The issue here was that Astral did not implement  for pipe objects, causing it to fall back to seeking. Since seeking on a pipe is not possible, the  error is returned. After implementing it, Minecraft got into the menu screen!

After that, it was smooth sailing. We were able to load into a world and verified that the game was working, from breaking blocks to saving. This was, to my knowledge, the first time a hobbyist OS ran Minecraft, which is a huge milestone not just for Astral but for the OSDev community as a whole, since it not only proves that it is possible, but also paves the way for others to do it as well with the open-source patches and mlibc fixes.

A lot of the recent Astral work has been towards self-hosting, speed, stability and just general usability. There is now a working package manager (xbps) and all the necessary tools for a networked install to disk. This work will likely continue for the near future, and, after more improvements, I have plans of eventually releasing a sort of  guide to build an Astral distribution from inside another Astral distribution. There are also plans to revive the Wine port (which is still not fully functional) with Dennis for both Astral and Managarm, as well as a possible future WebKitGTK port.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elle Fanning’s Closet Picks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G7KuHCJMFg</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4G7KuHCJMFg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:28:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The actor recalls a memorable viewing of THE RED SHOES, celebrates performances by Kirsten Dunst and Nicole Kidman, and shares why THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD made her want to work with Joachim Trier.

But these are interesting and turbulent times for the president.This week, the House of Representatives is due to finally vote on the release of the Epstein files. That had been delayed by the shutdown, with critics also accusing the Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of resisting putting it to the floor.In recent days, he denied knowing about Epstein’s crimes when they were friends; directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate a list of individuals mentioned in the documents (not himself); and cut ties with former loyalist Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the Republicans demanding the release of the files.Is this renewed transparency from Trump – or a rare moment in his second term where he is feeling the pressure from his party?Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat on the Oversight Committee, told me he was convinced Republicans were ready to break ranks with Trump.“I think the vote itself is pretty damning,” he said.“You’re going to see a lot of Republicans vote for it. I wouldn’t be surprised if it passes unanimously.“That’s my prediction on this because every Republican I’ve talked to has said that they want the files released as well. And that’s what makes this so uncomfortable for Donald Trump.”One Republican said that “100 or more” from the party were ready to go against the president.This is clearly a test for Republicans in a party that Trump has dominated since 2016. Every election cycle, five in total, has had him on the agenda. They rise and fall with him; many owe their election and re-election to him.But it’s become complicated for Republicans and the MAGA movement. The latter loves a conspiracy and Trump has been happy to indulge them, releasing documents related to the assassinations of John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. earlier this year.“Every Republican I’ve talked to has said that they want the files released as well. And that’s what makes this so uncomfortable for Donald Trump.”On Epstein, many in his government spent the election last year saying they would release the files. They then got cold feet in July and they have not really warmed up since.Last week’s emails – from Epstein’s estate – purportedly show the sex offender messaging his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011 that Trump was “the dog that hasn’t barked” and that the president had “spent hours” at his house with a victim.In another message from just before Epstein’s arrest in 2019, he claimed “Trump knew of it and came to my house many times during that period.” He did add: “He never got a massage.”None of this suggests Trump was involved in any criminal wrongdoing. But they are embarrassing. And embarrassment is not something the president wants.The MAGA crowd itself has been largely quiet in recent days, but that’s not surprising according to Mike Rothschild, the author of ‘The Storm is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything’.He says the MAGA reaction to any Epstein development follows a cycle.“It starts off with, ‘this is fake, this is a hoax, Democrats made this up.’ Then it transitions to, ‘well, it is real, but they’re not presenting it in the way that they should be.’ Then it transitions to, ‘it’s real and it’s great for us.’ There is nothing that happens to Trump or that Trump has done that cannot be rationalised or explained.”Perhaps we are now in the final phase, with the president saying Republicans in the House should vote to release the files.But there are still questions. Trump hasn’t said the Senate should back the measure, and he hasn’t said whether he will then sign off on a release.Trump’s Department of JusticeIndeed, the vote is to compel the DOJ to publish the files. That’s the Trump administration’s DOJ. The one he just told to investigate individuals like Bill Clinton and his ties with Epstein.Trump has upended history by interfering more and more with the DOJ – so why doesn’t he just tell his DOJ to release the files? He said in his Truth Social post that they had already published “tens of thousands of pages” on Epstein.But many of those were already in the public realm and the most recent documents have come from the House Oversight Committee, with Republicans there seemingly happy to keep pushing this issue as a way to please their base.Because Epstein is not the only MAGA headache right now. Republicans had awful results in recent elections. Those races were run on the economy, and the President just signed an executive order removing tariffs on certain food products to try to ease the cost of living.Elsewhere, Trump has come under fire because of his defence of foreign worker visas in a Fox News interview, with many in his base believing this goes against his ‘America First’ agenda. They were already questioning his commitment to issues at home after he bailed out Argentina and has focused on international affairs so much in recent months.As MAGA digests all of this, politicians in Congress have a decision to make about the 2026 midterm elections.“In a year, every single Republican in the House and a third of the Republicans in the Senate and thousands of Republicans across the country are going to have to run again,” Rothschild said.“They’re going to have to explain all of this to their voters and to their donors and try to get these people to understand why they have supported Trump through all of these increasingly awful revelations about Epstein.”“They’re going to have to explain all of this to their voters and to their donors and try to get these people to understand why they have supported Trump through all of these increasingly awful revelations about Epstein.”Congressman Thomas Massie, another Republican voting to release the files, told CNN: “I vote with my party 91 per cent of the time.“But when they are blowing our budget, when they are starting wars overseas, I’m sorry, I can’t go along with that. And back home, people agree with me.”Battle for the future of MAGAFor Rothschild, this is about the battle for the future of the MAGA movement and the Republican party beyond Trump.The influential conservative Tucker Carlson recently interviewed the far-right, white nationalist Nick Fuentes, fuelling a bitter debate about whether Carlson should be elevating such a fringe figure. The president of the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, came under fire for defending the interview, before then apologising.“You’re seeing a battle in the party of ‘how much can we push this conspiracy stuff’? How much can you push the anti-Semitism and the kind of neo-Nazi flirtations?” Rothschild told me.“We’re seeing the very beginnings of a party that has built itself around Donald Trump for the last 10 years realising that he’s going to be off the stage sooner rather than later, and they have to figure out who they are as a party. Right now, it’s just pure chaos.”Trump, who has met with Fuentes before, responded to all this chaos defending Carlson, saying: “if he wants to interview Nick Fuentes, I don’t know much about him, but if he wants to do it, get the word out. People have to decide.”“They [the Republicans] have to figure out who they are as a party. Right now, it’s just pure chaos.”The people, the politicians and the party now have to decide where this MAGA movement goes next.The new seeming party unity on the release of the Epstein files may not last, because while the likes of Thomas Massie have been leading the charge, he will not be defending Fuentes.Remember, Massie is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger next year.

Down went Apricot, before climbing back up with uncannily human movements. Bam! Peppermint Green was on the ropes, but staggered back into the ring exactly as Mohammed Ali or George Foreman might have done.“Wow, wow!” marvelled a woman in the audience, who told me she works in 3D printing.“This can change the world! If old people cannot work, this robot can help them,” she said.Indeed China, with its ageing population, is already developing humanoid robots to prepare food or clean up, while the machines in ‘dark factories’ are operated by robots that work round the clock.That’s not going to help the country’s growing youth unemployment problem, but it’s undoubtedly making manufacturing more efficient.Tech is changing China. Air pollution has noticeably cleared since my last visit to Shenzhen in 2013, mainly because more than three-quarters of the new cars on the roads are electric. We watched as several drivers arrived at a charging station to swap batteries, a simple process that takes three minutes.We watched as several drivers arrived at a charging station to swap batteries, a simple process that takes three minutes.With a full charge, our driver told me his BYD car can travel more than 500 kilometres (311 miles). The local government has invested in the infrastructure, so there’s no shortage of battery charging and swapping points around the province, and they’re being rolled out across the country.Another innovation since my last visit is the driverless robo-taxi. I have to confess I was a little nervous when I first got in, and there was an alarming moment as we set off when it braked suddenly to avoid a car pulling out ahead.But then everything went smoothly, and I was surprised at how quickly I got used to a car that drove itself (and talked to me in Chinese).The Chinese government gave us visas because they want to show that, as the global leader in robotics and EVs, they can take on the US as a technological superpower.But the US has the edge in artificial intelligence and advanced computer chips. President Biden banned China from accessing the US company Nvidia’s most sophisticated chips, which have military uses.At Huaqianbei, the world’s largest electronics market, I was told you can get them for a price, smuggled in via Japan and Hong Kong.The ban has had the unintended consequence of forcing China to innovate more quickly, as it tries to develop rival, sophisticated chips.Still, I was told that it will take five years or more for China to catch up with Nvidia and Taiwan’s TSMC. And as US companies develop ever more complex semiconductors, China may remain as the producer of ‘good enough’ chips, rather than the most advanced.Watching the Apricot v Peppermint-Green robot boxing match, I realised that the outcome of the battle for tech dominance between the US and China will affect us all.It’s less a rivalry between political systems – communism v capitalism, autocracy v democracy – and more about which superpower Europe and the rest of the world will depend on, as we also adopt tech for everyday uses.The fight for the future is on, and I was witnessing an early round.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>In The Robin Hood Forest With Ray Mears</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qXiPkE-Y8o</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2qXiPkE-Y8o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 20:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pick up your copy of The Book: The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding A Civilization today at https://bit.ly/3HedXsq and use the code HISTORYHIT10 at checkout!

Join woodsman and survival expert Ray Mears as he embarks on a unique journey into the heart of English history to uncover the truth behind one of Britain’s most enduring legends: Robin Hood.

Blending his totally unique knowledge of wilderness skills with a passion for history, Ray explores the landscapes, forests, and historical records that have shaped the myth of the heroic outlaw. 

From Sherwood’s ancient oak to a document hidden in a medieval castle library, he examines the evidence for the man behind the legend, asking whether Robin was a real figure, a combination of a number of people, or a timeless symbol of justice. 

To help him on his quest Ray has enlisted the help of a team of experts and some close friends who can help bring to life the harsh realities of medieval life and highlight the real history that is contained within the tale of Robin Hood.

The author of the paper, associate professor of government at Dartmouth and director of the Polarization Research Lab Sean Westwood, created an AI tool he calls "an autonomous synthetic respondent,” which can answer survey questions and “demonstrated a near-flawless ability to bypass the full range” of “state-of-the-art” methods for detecting bots. According to the paper, the AI agent evaded detection 99.8 percent of the time."We can no longer trust that survey responses are coming from real people," Westwood said in a press release. "With survey data tainted by bots, AI can poison the entire knowledge ecosystem.”Survey research relies on attention check questions (ACQs), behavioral flags, and response pattern analysis to detect inattentive humans or automated bots. Westwood said these methods are now obsolete after his AI agent bypassed the full range of standard ACQs and other detection methods outlined in prominent papers, including one paper designed to detect AI responses. The AI agent also successfully avoided “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors by presenting tasks that an LLM could complete easily, but are nearly impossible for a human. Are you a researcher who is dealing with the problem of AI-generated survey data? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at ‪(609) 678-3204‬. Otherwise, send me an email at emanuel@404media.co.“Once the reasoning engine decides on a response, the first layer executes the action with a focus on human mimicry,” the paper, titled “The potential existential threat of large language models to online survey research,” says. “To evade automated detection, it simulates realistic reading times calibrated to the persona’s education level, generates human-like mouse movements, and types open-ended responses keystroke by-keystroke, complete with plausible typos and corrections. The system is also designed to accommodate tools for bypassing antibot measures like reCAPTCHA, a common barrier for automated systems.”The AI, according to the paper, is able to model “a coherent demographic persona,” meaning that in theory someone could sway any online research survey to produce any result they want based on an AI-generated demographic. And it would not take that many fake answers to impact survey results. As the press release for the paper notes, for the seven major national polls before the 2024 election, adding as few as 10 to 52 fake AI responses would have flipped the predicted outcome. Generating these responses would also be incredibly cheap at five cents each. According to the paper, human respondents typically earn $1.50 for completing a survey.Westwood’s AI agent is a model-agnostic program built in Python, meaning it can be deployed with APIs from big AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, but can also be hosted locally with open-weight models like LLama. The paper used OpenAI’s o4-mini in its testing, but some tasks were also completed with DeepSeek R1, Mistral Large, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok3, Gemini 2.5 Preview, and others, to prove the method works with various LLMs. The agent is given one prompt of about 500 words which tells it what kind of persona to emulate and to answer questions like a human. The paper says that there are several ways researchers can deal with the threat of AI agents corrupting survey data, but they come with trade-offs. For example, researchers could do more identity validation on survey participants, but this raises privacy concerns. Meanwhile, the paper says, researchers should be more transparent about how they collect survey data and consider more controlled methods for recruiting participants, like address-based sampling or voter files.“Ensuring the continued validity of polling and social science research will require exploring and innovating research designs that are resilient to the challenges of an era defined by rapidly evolving artificial intelligence,” the paper said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: PrinceJS – 19,200 req/s Bun framework in 2.8 kB (built by a 13yo)</title><link>https://princejs.vercel.app/</link><author>lilprince1218</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>F-20: The Light Fighter That Should Have Dominated.</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpaK4HHiClI</link><author>Megaprojects</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VpaK4HHiClI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 19:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0woBco6Dgcxt0h8SwyyOmw">Megaprojects</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get PLAUD Today!

The pandemic made people play more and caused a small boom, which then subsided, resulting in wave after wave of massive layoffs. Microsoft, one of the major console manufacturers, is shifting its strategy for Xbox as the company shifts its focus to AI. And now, Electronic Arts, once a load-bearing publisher for the industry with brands like  and , is going private via a leveraged buyout in a deal involving Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Jared Kushner. Video games are more popular than ever, but many of the biggest companies in the business seem like they are struggling to adapt and convert that popularity into stability and sustainability. To try and understand what the hell is going on, this week we have a conversation between Emanuel and Jason Schreier, who reports about video games for Bloomberg and one of the best journalists on this beat. Jason helps us unpack why Microsoft is now aiming for higher-than-average profit margins at Xbox and why the company is seemingly bowing out of the console business despite a massive acquisition spree. We also talk about what the EA deal tells us about other game publishers, and what all these problems tell us about changing player habits and the future of big budget video games. Become a paid subscriber for early access to these interview episodes and to power our journalism.

DESCRIPTION
Apache Spark contributor Holden Karau discusses the evolution of distributed data processing, the challenges of integrating machine learning with big data tools, and the technical complexities of working with GPUs at scale.

The conversation takes a personal turn as Holden reveals her latest project: an open-source AI tool that helps people appeal health insurance claim denials. Drawing from personal experiences with denied claims, she has built a system that trains on independent medical review data to generate effective appeals, making it freely available at https://fighthealthinsurance.com while grappling with the classic open-source challenge of sustainable funding.

The Gulf Livestock 1 was steaming into the path of Maysak, a Category 4 typhoon that was hurtling up the Philippine Sea with 130 mph winds and 20-foot waves. Even the sturdiest cargo ship would take a beating in such conditions. But for the Gulf, Maysak spelled catastrophe.

Gulf Livestock 1 was due to arrive at Tangshan, a massive Chinese port complex about 100 miles from Beijing, in four days. It was the height of pandemic gridlock in ports around the world, especially in China, where ships often waited more than two days to offload. For the Gulf, which carried a shifting, easily frightened cargo of 5,867 dairy cattle, every extra day at anchor heightened the risk of the animals becoming ill or dying—and of costing the exporter and ship owner money.

The ship continued its route towards China. The eventual sinking of Gulf Livestock 1 was the worst disaster in the history of the live-export trade, an industry made up of about 150 ships with a market value totaling as much as $30 billion. While the industry’s size makes it a tiny fraction of the $2.2 trillion global commercial shipping fleet, which numbers around 100,000 vessels, the live-export fleet was already disproportionately prone to catastrophic accidents.

This story was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit investigative news organization.

Charismatic, manipulative and unrepentant, he became the central figure of the proceedings. This episode examines Göring’s performance in the courtroom and his unusual relationship with U.S. Army psychiatrist Dr Douglas Kelley, who was tasked with assessing the mental state of the Nazi defendants.For this, we're joined by Jack El-Hai, author of ‘The Nazi and the Psychiatrist'. Through their exchanges, Jack explains how Göring sought to control his legacy and what his case revealed about the psychology of power and guilt in the aftermath of war.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>618.

If you enjoyed the video, please help feed the algorithm by liking and commenting. This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you!

Was John Brown a heroic freedom fighter or a dangerous terrorist? On 16th October 1859, this radical abolitionist led an armed raid on Harper's Ferry, attempting to spark a slave rebellion that would tear America apart. Sixteen months later, the nation was plunged into Civil War. 

Brown's execution made him a martyr in the North and a monster in the South. His body was "a-mouldering in the grave," but his actions ignited the powder keg that had been building for decades. No single figure better embodies the violent collision between slavery and freedom that defined 19th century America. 

From his brutal actions in “Bleeding Kansas" to his final words on the gallows, this is the story of the man who forced America to confront its original sin—and paid the ultimate price.

For Andrew Garfield, it only made him better.

After years of working his way through British films, Garfield broke out in Hollywood with The Social Network. He was charming, vulnerable, and instantly in demand. Then came Spider-Man, his dream role since childhood. He poured everything into it, but behind the scenes, the experience was far from heroic. Studio politics and the scrapping of his sequels left him feeling lost, both with the industry and himself.

But he didn’t give up. He chased riskier and more personal roles that challenged him as an actor, like a soldier who refused to use a weapon in Hacksaw Ridge, a priest questioning his faith in Silence, a composer racing against time in Tick, Tick… Boom!, and a performance so demanding it nearly broke him in Angels in America. Some of those roles took a year to prepare, but each one brought him closer to the kind of actor he wanted to be.

This is the story of an actor who refused to give up, both with his career and his commitment to every role. This is Andrew Garfield.

Is it possible to reverse this global trend by using water more sparingly in households, industry, and agriculture?

"Water is an important but not an infinite resource," warns Dorothea Mergel, a project engineer at Hamburg's water company, adding that water is becoming increasingly scarce both in Germany and around the world. Mergel is working to make sure that the drinking water supply in Germany's second-largest city is sustainable. One idea is a pilot project in which "gray water" - wastewater from our showers and kitchen sinks - is used to flush toilets and water gardens, thus saving precious drinking water.

In Tunisia, every drop counts - especially in agriculture. The country has a high proportion of desert, with temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius in summer. Agricultural scientist Dr. Bellachheb Chahbani has developed a method of traditional irrigation that reduces water use by 70%. Dr. Chahbani visits olive farmers in the south of the country, helping to set up the water-saving system.

Industry has the potential to save enormous amounts of water, too. Water conservationist Andreas Kirketerp works at the Carlsberg Brewery in Fredericia, Denmark. His innovative system recycles the water used to clean bottles, cans, equipment, and tanks, making it usable again. The saving amounts to 1,800 cubic meters of water every day - or the daily water consumption of around 14,000 people. The effect on the local drinking water supply has been hugely positive.

Spirituality requires consciousness because we need to be aware, and to be self-aware, in order to apprehend spirituality of any kind. But is there more to the relationship? Some make the extravagant claim that our human consciousness is somehow connected directly to a’ cosmic consciousness’? Can this make sense? If so, what would it mean?

Many male survivors, like Masokolo Lemba from the Congo, remain silent due to intense stigma and the deeply ingrained taboos surrounding the topic. 

Lemba fled to Uganda, seeking safety, but survivors there face an additional grave danger: the country's Anti-Homosexuality Act, which criminalizes same-sex acts. 
 
Despite these challenges, organizations like the Refugee Law Project in Kampala, Uganda, provide a safe space for male survivors to speak about their trauma and begin the long process of healing.

The California-headquartered firm, which operates out of financial centers including New York, Paris and London, was founded by her family as a traditional asset manager, but has now expanded into alternative sectors including real estate and private credit, which has soared after banks tightened their lending following the 2008 financial crisis.

The sportswear giant also became over reliant on three main shoes: the Air Jordan One, the Air Force One and the Nike Dunk. So how is the company’s new CEO turning things around?

WSJ sat down with Nike CEO Elliott Hill to learn about his plan to diversify the product line, lean on retail partners like Amazon and more.

They are harrowing testimonies to the cruelty of war. In this film, the calls are juxtaposed against images of the destruction of Ukraine.

Oksana Karpovych's documentary sets images of the war in Ukraine against audio of Russian soldiers phoning their families from the front line. It links the destruction of the nation with those responsible for it, thus highlighting the tragedy of war. But the documentary also shows Ukrainians trying to live relatively normal lives despite the attack on their country.

Tension can be heard in the voices of the Russian soldiers. Their accounts reflect the phases they have gone through during their deployment, from a sense of supposed heroism in response to propaganda, to doubt and subsequent disillusionment. Sometimes the fighters lose their heads, committing looting and other crimes. These diverse recordings reveal the full extent of Russian aggression in Ukraine.

The award-winning and acclaimed film is a powerful document about the dehumanizing power of war. The juxtaposition of images of the war with the intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers and their relatives amounts to a profound reflection on the banality of evil.

Each iteration creates a branch, applies a focused code change, generates a commit, opens a PR via GitHub's CLI, waits for required checks and reviews, merges if green, and records state into a shared notes file.This avoids the typical stateless one-shot pattern of current coding agents and enables multi-step changes without losing intermediate reasoning, test failures, or partial progress.The tool is useful for tasks that require many small, serial modifications: increasing test coverage, large refactors, dependency upgrades guided by release notes, or framework migrations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scientists Make Genetic Breakthrough with 39,000-Year-Old Mammoth RNA</title><link>https://www.404media.co/scientists-make-genetic-breakthrough-with-39-000-year-old-mammoth-rna/</link><author>Becky Ferreira</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/CleanShot-2025-11-15-at-08.21.16@2x.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:23:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to the Abstract! These are the studies this week that reached back through time, flooded the zone, counted the stars, scored science goals, and topped it all off with a ten-course meal.First, scientists make a major breakthrough thanks to a very cute mammoth mummy. Then: the climate case for busy beavers; how to reconnect with 3,000 estranged siblings; this is your brain on football; and last, what Queen Elizabeth II had for lunch on February 20, 1957.The long afterlife of Yuka the mammothScientists have sequenced RNA—a key ingredient of life as we know it—from the remains of a mammoth that lived 39,000 years ago during the Pleistocene “Ice Age” period, making it by far the oldest RNA on record. The  for oldest RNA was sourced from a puppy that lived in Siberia 14,300 years ago. The new study has now pushed that timeline back by an extraordinary 25,000 years, opening a new window into ancient genetics and revealing a surprise about a famous mammoth mummy called Yuka. “Ancient DNA has revolutionized the study of extinct and extant organisms that lived up to 2 million years ago, enabling the reconstruction of genomes from multiple extinct species, as well as the ecosystems where they once thrived,” said researchers led by Emilio Mármol Sánchez of the Globe Institute in Copenhagen, who completed the study while at Stockholm University.“However, current DNA sequencing techniques alone cannot directly provide insights into tissue identity, gene expression dynamics, or transcriptional regulation, as these are encoded in the RNA fraction.”“Here, we report transcriptional profiles from 10 late Pleistocene woolly mammoths,” the team continued. “One of these, dated to be ∼39,000 years old, yielded sufficient detail to recover…the oldest ancient RNA sequences recorded to date.”DNA, the double-stranded “blueprint” molecule that stores genetic information, is far sturdier than RNA, which is why it can be traced back for millions of years instead of thousands. Single-stranded RNA, a “messenger” molecule that carries out the orders of DNA, is more fragile and rare in the paleontological record.In addition to proving that RNA can survive much longer than previously known, the team discovered that Yuka—the mammoth that died 39,000 years ago—has been misgendered for years (yes, I realize gender is a social construct that does not apply to extremely dead mammoths, but mis-sexed just doesn’t have the same ring). Yuka was originally deemed female according to a 2021 study that observed the “presence of skin folds in the genital area compatible with labia vulvae structures in modern elephants and the absence of male-specific muscle structures.” Mármol Sánchez and his colleagues have now overturned this anatomical judgement by probing the genetic remnants of Yuka’s Y chromosome.In fact, as I write this on Thursday, November 13—a day before the embargo on this study lifts on Friday—Yuka is still listed as female on Wikipedia. Just a day until you can live your truth, buddy.Every era has a champion; in our warming world, eager beavers may rise to claim this lofty title. These enterprising rodents are textbook “ecosystem engineers” that reshape environments with sturdy dams that create biodiverse havens that are resistant to climate change. To better assess the role of beavers in the climate crisis, researchers reviewed the reported behavioral beaver-related restoration (BRR) projects across North America. “Climate change is projected to impact streamflow patterns in western North America, reducing aquatic habitat quantity and quality and harming native species, but BRR has the potential to ameliorate some of these impacts,” said researchers led by Jesse A. S. Burgher of Washington State University. The team reports “substantial evidence that BRR increases climate resiliency…by reducing summer water temperatures, increasing water storage, and enhancing floodplain connectivity” while also creating “fire-resistant habitat patches.” So go forth and get busy, beavers! May we survive this crisis in part through the skin of your teeth.One big happy stellar familyVisible from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the Pleiades is the most widely recognized and culturally significant star cluster in the night sky. While this asterism is defined by a handful of especially radiant stars, known as the Seven Sisters, scientists have now tracked down thousands of other stellar siblings born from the same clutch scattered across some 2,000 light years.“We find that the Pleiades constitutes the bound core of a much larger, coeval structure” and “we refer to this structure as the Greater Pleiades Complex,” said researchers led by Andrew W. Boyle of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “On the basis of uniform ages, coherent space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and traceback histories, we conclude that most stars in this complex originated from the same giant molecular cloud.” The work “further cements the Pleiades as a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics” and adds new allure to a cluster that first exploded into the skies during the Cretaceous age. (For more on the Pleiades, check out  I wrote earlier this year about the deep roots of its lore).Scientists have peered into a place I would never dare to visit—the minds of football fans during high-stakes plays. To tap into the neural side of fanaticism, researchers enlisted 60 healthy male fans from the ages of 20 to 45 to witness dozens of goal sequences from matches involving their favorite teams, rival teams, and “neutral” teams while their brains were scanned by an fMRI machine. The participants were rated according to a “Football Supporters Fanaticism Scale (FSFS)” with criteria like “violent thought and/or action tendencies” and “institutional belonging and/or identification.” The scale divided the group up into 38 casual spectators, 19 committed fans, and four deranged fanatics (adjectives are mine for flourish).“Our key findings revealed that scoring against rivals activated the reward system…while conceding to rivals triggered the mentalization network and inhibited the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)”—a region responsible for cognitive control and decision-making—said researchers led by Francisco Zamorano of the Universidad San Sebastián in Chile. “Higher Football Supporters Fanaticism Scale scores correlated with reduced dACC activation during defeats, suggesting impaired emotional regulation in highly engaged fans.”In other words, it is now scientifically confirmed that football fanatics are Messi bitches who love drama. Diplomacy served up freshWe’ll close, as all things should, with a century of fine Portuguese dining. In yet another edition of “yes, this can be a job,” researchers collected 457 menus served at various diplomatic meals in Portugal from 1910 to 2023 to probe “how Portuguese gastronomic culture has been leveraged as a culinary diplomacy and geopolitical rapprochement strategy.” As a lover of both food and geopolitical bureaucracy, this study really hit the spot. Highlights include a 1957 “regional lunch” for Queen Elizabeth II that aimed to channel “Portugality” through dishes like lobster and fruit tarts from the cities of Peniche and Alcobaça. The study is also filled with amazing asides like “the inclusion of  ice cream in the European Free Trade Association official luncheon (ID45, 1960) seems to transmit a sense of geopolitical greatness and vast governing capacity.” Ice cream just tastes so much better when it’s a symbol of international power. The team also unearthed a possible faux pas: Indian president Ramaswamy Venkataraman, a vegetarian who was raised Hindu, was served roast beef in 1990. In a footnote, Cabral and his colleagues concluded that “further investigation is deemed necessary to understand the context of ‘roast beef’ service to the Indian President in 1990.” Talk about juicy gossip! Thanks for reading! See you next week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Carol Cleland - Philosophy of Molecular Biology and Genes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8vY8YgRxn0</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/o8vY8YgRxn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like us on Facebook for daily videos, updates, announcements, and much more: https://shorturl.at/tak4l

Hawley (R-MO), Sen. Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Britt (R-AL), Sen. Warner (D-VA), and Sen. Murphy (D-CT) would require AI chatbots to verify all users’ ages, prohibit minors from using AI tools, and implement steep criminal penalties for chatbots that promote or solicit certain harms. That might sound reasonable at first, but behind those talking points lies a sprawling surveillance and censorship regime that would reshape how people of all ages use the internet.The GUARD Act may  like a child-safety bill, but in practice it’s an age-gating mandate that could be imposed on nearly every public-facing AI chatbot.The GUARD Act may  like a child-safety bill, but in practice it’s an age-gating mandate that could be imposed on nearly every public-facing AI chatbot—from customer-service bots to search-engine assistants. The GUARD Act could force countless AI companies to collect sensitive identity data, chill online speech, and block teens from using the digital tools that they rely on every day.EFF has warned for years that age-verification laws endanger free expression, privacy, and competition. There are legitimate concerns about transparency and accountability in AI, but the GUARD Act’s sweeping mandates are not the solution.TELL CONGRESS: The guard act won't keep us safeYoung People's Access to Legitimate AI Tools Could Be Cut Off Entirely. The GUARD Act doesn’t give parents a choice—it simply blocks minors from AI companions altogether. If a chat system’s age-verification process determines that a user is under 18, that user must then be locked out completely. The GUARD Act contains no parental consent mechanism, no appeal process for errors in age estimation, and no flexibility for any other context.The bill’s definition of an AI “companion” is ambiguous enough that it could easily be interpreted to extend beyond general-use LLMs like ChatGPT, causing overcautious companies to block young people from other kinds of AI services too. In practice, this means that under the GUARD Act, teenagers may not be able to use chatbots to get help with homework, seek customer service assistance for a product they bought, or even ask a search engine a question. It could also cut off all young people’s access to educational and creative tools that have quickly become a part of everyday learning and life online.The GUARD Act’s sponsors claim these rules will keep our children safe, but that’s not true.By treating all young people—whether seven or seventeen—the same, the GUARD Act threatens their ability to explore their identities, get answers to questions free from shame or stigma, and gradually develop a sense of autonomy as they mature into adults. Denying teens’ access to online spaces doesn’t make them safer, it just keeps them uninformed and unprepared for adult life.  The GUARD Act’s sponsors claim these rules will keep our children safe, but that’s not true. Instead, it will undermine both safety  autonomy by replacing parental guidance with government mandates and building mass surveillance infrastructure instead of privacy controls.All Age Verification Systems Are Dangerous. This Is No Different. Teens aren’t the only ones who lose out under the GUARD Act. The bill would require platforms to confirm the ages of all users—young and old—before allowing them to speak, learn, or engage with their AI tools.Under the GUARD Act, platforms can’t rely on a simple “I’m over 18” checkbox or self-attested birthdate. Instead, they must build or buy a “commercially reasonable” age-verification system that collects identifying information (like a government ID, credit record, or biometric data) from every user before granting them access to the AI service. Though the GUARD Act does contain some data minimization language, its mandate to periodically re-verify users means that platforms must either retain or re-collect that sensitive user data as needed. Both of those options come with major privacy risks.  EFF has long documented the dangers of age-verification systems:They create attractive targets for hackers. Third-party services that collect users’ sensitive ID and biometric data for the purpose of age verification have been repeatedly breached, exposing millions to identity theft and other harms.They implement mass surveillance systems and ruin  To verify your age, a system must determine and record who you are. That means every chatbot interaction could feasibly be linked to your verified identity.They disproportionately harm vulnerable groups. Many people—especially activists and dissidents, trans and gender-nonconforming folks, undocumented people, and survivors of abuse—avoid systems that force identity disclosure. The GUARD Act would entirely cut off their ability to use these public AI tools.Only the biggest companies can afford the compliance and liability burden of mass identity verification. Smaller, privacy-respecting developers simply can’t compete.As we’ve said repeatedly, there’s no such thing as “safe” age verification. Every approach—whether it’s facial or biometric scans, government ID uploads, or behavioral or account analysis—creates new privacy, security, and expressive harms.Vagueness + Steep Fines = Censorship. Full Stop. Though mandatory age-gates provide reason enough to oppose the GUARD Act, the definitions of “AI chatbot” and “AI companion” are also vague and broad enough to raise alarms. In a nutshell, the Act’s definitions of these two terms are so expansive that they could cover nearly any system capable of generating “human-like” responsesincluding not just general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT, but also more tailored services like those used for customer service interactions, search-engine summaries, and subject-specific research tools.The bill defines an “AI chatbot” as any service that produces “adaptive” or “context-responsive” outputs that aren’t fully predetermined by a developer or operator. That could include Google’s search summaries, research tools like Perplexity, or any AI-powered Q&A tool—all of which respond to natural language prompts and dynamically generate conversational text.Meanwhile, the GUARD Act’s definition of an “AI companion”—a system that both produces “adaptive” or “context-responsive” outputs  encourages or simulates “interpersonal or emotional interaction”—will easily sweep in general-purpose tools like ChatGPT. Courts around the country are already seeing claims that conversational AI tools manipulate users’ emotions to increase engagement. Under this bill, that’s enough to trigger the “AI companion” label, putting AI developers at risk even when they do not intend to cause harm.Both of these definitions are imprecise and unconstitutionally overbroad. And, when combined with the GUARD Act’s incredibly steep fines (up to $100,000 per violation, enforceable by the federal Attorney General and every state AG), companies worried about their legal liability will inevitably err on the side of prohibiting minors from accessing their chat systems. The GUARD Act leaves them these options: censor certain topics en masse, entirely block users under 18 from accessing their services, or implement broad-sweeping surveillance systems as a prerequisite to access. No matter which way platforms choose to go, the inevitable result for users is less speech, less privacy, and less access to genuinely helpful tools.While there may be legitimate problems with AI chatbots, young people’s safety is an incredibly complex social issue both on- and off-line. The GUARD Act tries to solve this complex problem with a blunt, dangerous solution.In other words, protecting young people’s online safety is incredibly important, but to do so by forcing invasive ID checks, criminalizing AI tools, and banning teens from legitimate digital spaces is not a good way out of this.The GUARD Act would make the internet less free, less private, and less safe for everyone.The GUARD Act would make the internet less free, less private, and less safe for everyone. It would further consolidate power and resources in the hands of the bigger AI companies, crush smaller developers, and chill innovation under the threat of massive fines. And it would cut off vulnerable groups’ ability to use helpful everyday AI tools, further stratifying the internet we know and love.Lawmakers should reject the GUARD Act and focus instead on policies that provide transparency, more options for users, and comprehensive privacy for all. Help us tell Congress to oppose the GUARD Act today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s 50-Year Mortgage Plan: What You MUST Know!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8FcRbLCwEk</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q8FcRbLCwEk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 22:15:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[✨ Start designing today with Gamma for free ➡️ https://gamma.app/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=nov25&utm_content=akg_PBoyle

This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you! 

Sigmund Freud revolutionized our understanding of the human mind—but behind the genius was a man battling his own demons. This is the story of how an addict doctor from Vienna became the father of psychoanalysis and changed psychology forever.

Born in 1856 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Freud's early life was marked by ambition and intellectual curiosity. As a young neurologist, he experimented with narcotics, believing it to be a miracle drug—a decision that would haunt him for decades. Yet this same flawed man would go on to unlock the secrets of the unconscious mind, revealing hidden desires, repressed memories, and the dark forces that drive human behavior.

From his groundbreaking work on dream interpretation to his controversial theories of psychosexual development, Freud's ideas sparked both revolution and outrage. His concept of the id, ego, and superego fundamentally changed how we understand personality. His exploration of childhood trauma laid the foundation for modern psychotherapy. But his personal struggles—his addiction, his complex relationships, his flight from Nazi-occupied Austria—reveal a man as troubled as the patients he treated.

This documentary explores the complete life of Sigmund Freud: the brilliant theorist who gave us the "Freudian slip," the flawed human who couldn't escape his own addictions, and the cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the therapist's couch. Through his triumphs and failures, we see how one man's inner turmoil became the key to understanding the human psyche itself.

All human history essentially comes down to biography. Every revolution in thought, every breakthrough in science, is shaped by the decisions and experiences of individual human beings. To understand the birth of modern psychology, we must understand the addicted genius who created it.

But there actually is a way to listen to space. Astronomers use things called  “sonifications,” where they translate data into sound. This visualization is a sonification made by scientists at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory of the center of the Milky Way. The piano represents infrared light, the violin represents visible light, and the glockenspiel represents X-ray light. And scientists we spoke to say listening to things like this can sometimes be better than looking at images for noticing new phenomena in space. #sound #space #nasa #violin #piano #glockenspiel #unexplainable #podcast

The punctuation mark appears frequently in outputs from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, sometimes to the point where readers believe they can identify AI writing by its overuse alone—although people can overuse it, too.On Thursday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that ChatGPT has started following custom instructions to avoid using em dashes. “Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do!” he wrote.The post, which came two days after the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1 AI model, received mixed reactions from users who have struggled for years with getting the chatbot to follow specific formatting preferences. And this “small win” raises a very big question: If the world’s most valuable AI company has struggled with controlling something as simple as punctuation use after years of trying, perhaps what people call artificial general intelligence (AGI) is farther off than some in the industry claim.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The gaming console wars just got weird...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8QdKRbC1O0</link><author>Fireship</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q8QdKRbC1O0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Brilliant for free - https://brilliant.org/fireship and get 20% off a premium annual subscription

Some 16 million people live in this crowded city on the Bosporus. For many, it is a center of creativity. For others, a place that swallows them up.

At night, the major changes that the megacity is currently undergoing become apparent: The economic crisis is weighing on people's minds and pocketbooks and poverty is constantly on the rise. 

Şevket is a cab driver. For more than 20 years, he’s been taking photo portraits of people living on the streets during his night-time journeys. His subjects now include entire families who no longer have a place to live. 

Towards morning, Şevket caters to people coming from the clubs, ferrying them safely home. Istanbul is famous for its party scene, but it is clearly feeling the effects of the prescribed Islamization.

Şükrü is a choreographer who teaches dances that, as he says, bring out the feminine side. His students include men and women.

In today's Turkey, this kind of activity is increasingly difficult and can only be practiced in special, protected spaces.

The film accompanies people who seek happiness in the city they love. Many want to preserve its former cosmopolitan flair.

This week, we discuss getting back on our AI slop bullshit, deepfakes in schools, and epistemic virtues. I was back on my bullshit this week, by which I mean staring at some horrible AI-generated shit on Facebook. In this case, I was looking at slop of ICE raids generated using OpenAI’s Sora. I talk about this in the article but one of the many reasons why I think social media—especially Facebook and Instagram—is fucked if they continue to monetize and promote this stuff is because this specific slop page is not being pushed by anyone who seems to have any sort of ideological interest in immigration or the United States or anything like that. It’s just someone trying to make money. And it’s almost definitely one single person, with one single account, generating millions and millions and millions of views. We are very early in the horrible AI slop game, and yet we are seeing the damage that just a few people can do with industrial-grade content generation machines. Over the years I have talked to a lot of academics about the idea of “trolling” on the internet. The person who has most informed my thinking over the years is Whitney Phillips, who has written a lot about 4chan, “trolling” culture, and generally the worst corners of the internet in a series of books and papers. This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things, which is about 4chan, is extremely good, as is her paper called The Oxygen of Amplification. She (and other academics) have argued that it’s not the intent behind “trolls” that matters, it’s the impact. She wrote a lot about “just trolling” racism and misogyny and xenophobia on the internet and what’s important is how it impacts people and changes how they interact with online spaces. You can’t really be “ironically” racist, you’re just racist. And with anonymity and pseudonymity online, you can’t really infer what’s inside of someone’s heart because often it doesn’t matter if the person posting Harambe memes or making deepfake nudes of celebrities of their classmates or whatever didn’t actually “mean” it. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The USS Ford Is Streaming Into the Caribbean: A Breakdown of Its Firepower</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v9bJnLN4FCE</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/v9bJnLN4FCE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:28:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WSJ’s Shelby Holliday explains the escalation in firepower that the world’s largest aircraft carrier brings to the Caribbean.

Human intervention was required “only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign).” Anthropic said the hackers had employed AI agentic capabilities to an “unprecedented” extent.“This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI ‘agents’—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention,” Anthropic said. “Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>America&apos;s Wildlife: Wolves, Gators, &amp; Moose | America the Wild MEGA Episode | Nat Geo Animals</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzj5yh_lnzA</link><author>Nat Geo Animals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yzj5yh_lnzA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:02:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPk9MG2RexnOMGTD-YnSnA">Nat Geo Animals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[North America has many diverse climates, leading to varied wildlife.

After his father’s death the family grew up in rural poverty, but after a visit to Paris as a teenager, Dumas fell in love with the city and its theatre. Using his father’s connections he found a job there and was soon a successful playwright, before turning his attention to novels. He was a prolific author, writing such blockbusters as The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Christo. But amidst the writing, Dumas also found plenty of time for romantic dalliances, political entanglements, and global travel. This episode explores his extraordinary life and the incredible works of literature he created, set against the turbulent background of French politics in the years after the Napoleonic wars.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Butler & Fable Siegel of Lackadaisy. (https://www.youtube.com/@LackadaisyComic)

For those who don’t know, Lackadaisy is an indie comic that became an indie animated series. It’s about a group of cats who run a speakeasy in St. Louis during Prohibition.

We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and want to share the results.

This conversation was put together with the support of Eat Your Peas (https://www.youtube.com/@EatYourPeas_Acc) an animation coaching collective run by Lindsay Knowler.

Our conversation with the Lackadaisy team focused on three major topics.

The first - a guide through the opening sequence of the pilot, available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffu6FG4YP4

The second - what it was like for them to run an indie animation studio remotely.

And the third - the current state of the animation industry itself. 

So come join us by the fire and enjoy!

​​00:00 Intro
01:13 Part One, opening sequence of pilot
04:10 From comic to animation, working on your opening later
08:31 The sample platter vs. traditional pilot, additive nature of animation
12:46 Small details, the moon, screen direction, car driving by
16:19 80s & 90s influences, Great Mouse Detective, Secret of Nimh, The Rescuers
19:17 Part Two, The Average Day on an Indie Production
21:51 Value of a Production Manager
25:27 Overestimating abilities, being a leader, hustle culture
27:38 Downtime, needing to live, finding inspiration for art in life
32:32 A lot of animation production is cloistered off
34:39 Part Three, The Industry
36:53 Why is indie animation happening right now?
40:44 Art is communication, not worried about GenAI, perfection
46:09 Fable’s intentions
49:54 Tracy’s intentions
52:58 Last bit

open source
release!We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in
August, following our now well-established and dependable release
cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform
for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building
robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for
building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements.
Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by
generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset
to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s
production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents,
and infrastructure.First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the
new  package
significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous
code. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The  package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
 package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.This isn’t the only boost the  package got over the past year. The new
 API is both easier to use
than the original  API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The
 package also has new APIs that make it easy to
cleanup in tests that use
, and that make it
easy to write to the test’s log.Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25
launched container-aware scheduling, making
this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this
transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers,
preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s
out-of-the-box production-readiness.Go 1.25’s new flight recorder builds on our already
powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of
production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected 
information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight
recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent
events in great detail  something has gone wrong.Secure software developmentGo continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making
significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its
standard library for enhanced safety.Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard
library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security
audit conducted by independent security firm Trail of
Bits yielded excellent
results, with only a single low-severity finding.
Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and
Geomys, these packages achieved CAVP certification,
paving the way for full FIPS 140-3 certification. This is a
vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140
compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported
solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to
safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be  and
. For example, the 
API—added in Go 1.24—enables traversal-resistant file system
access, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
 API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.Under-the-hood improvementsIn addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under
the hood over the past year.For Go 1.24, we completely redesigned the 
implementation, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to  performance, lower tail latency of  operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage
collector called Green Tea. Green Tea reduces garbage
collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much
as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints
of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly
exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will
achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware
that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh
impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled
by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software
development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular
releases of the gopls language server, and have formed partnerships to
support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs.
Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of
reading and writing Go code (see the v0.17.0,
v0.18.0, v0.19.0, and
v0.20.0 release notes for full details, or our new
gopls feature documentation!). Some highlights include many
new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go
code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON
struct tags; and an experimental built-in server for the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI
assistants in the form of MCP tools.With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring automatic code modernizers. As Go
evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better
ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go
stands by its compatibility promise—the old way will continue
to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old
idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old
idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more 
replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What  did for
stylistic consistency, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant  command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its pre-Go 1.0
roots.At the end of September, in collaboration with
Anthropic and the Go community, we released
v1.0.0 of
the official Go SDK for the
Model Context Protocol (MCP). This SDK
supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP
functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower
other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such
as the recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK) for
Go from Google.
ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building
modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go
demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and
reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting
more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.Go has an exciting year ahead of it.We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new 
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
upgrade to , driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; leaked goroutine
profiling, contributed by
Uber’s Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to , , and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the
future of the Go open source project itself. From its humble
beginnings, Go has formed a
thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our
ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software
industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development
processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply
involve our wonderful contributor community.Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor
communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside Motorsport Valley’s High-Tech Future | Power Players</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loRlblRyMMk</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/loRlblRyMMk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 23:01:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jason Kelly visits the UK’s Motorsport Valley, where Williams Team Principal James Volwes and F1 Academy drivers’ champion Abbi Pulling show how advanced simulation is shaping the future of Formula 1.

The fabulous Edgar Wright joins us on this week’s Take to talk ‘The Running Man’—his new adaptation of the Stephen King dystopia. You might remember the Arnie version from 1987, but Wright’s is a refreshed take starring very angry action man Glen Powell. He plays Ben Richards, an out-of-work dad living in the slums of a sci-fi totalitarian state, who enters a deathmatch gameshow in the hope of winning the cash he needs to save his sick child. Edgar and Simon talk action classics, staying on Arnie’s good side, and why Stephen King called the film ‘Die Hard for our time’.  

Mark reviews it too—plus two more big movies out this week: a blockbuster and an exciting indie. In the arthouse corner, the Palme d’Or-winning ‘Titane’ director Julia Ducournau’s latest, ‘Alpha’. In her usual out-there style, it follows a troubled teenage girl who returns home with a mysterious tattoo, amidst a terrifying bloodborne epidemic. And from Hollywood, ‘Now You See Me: Now You Don’t’, the latest entry in the slick magician‑heist franchise... which has left Mark wishing it would do a disappearing act. Ladies and gentlemen, be marveled as a Kermodean rant is conjured before your eyes!  

Plus more exquisite dad jokes and guaranteed groans in The Laughter Lift, and we’ll hear plenty from you lovely lot as always—including some prizewinning pedantry. Keep it coming!

We’re expected to have 2 billion more mouths to feed by 2050. But how can we feed all those people in a way that is still sustainable and ethical? Many have argued that aquaculture (or fish farming) is one of the most sustainable ways we can consume animal protein, since it requires less land use. It’s currently the quickest-growing form of food production in the world. But how exactly does it work? And is it really the best path forward? 

To find out more, Vox video producer Nate Krieger went down the rabbit hole on salmon aquaculture. Salmon is currently the most popular fish in the US: The average American consumes 3.2 pounds of salmon annually. And over 70% of that salmon comes from farms, totalling 3 million tons of salmon a year. 

To understand the impact that the salmon industry is having on our planet and our future, and on the salmon themselves, we spoke to industry insiders, marine biologists, and fish welfare experts. 

This is a complicated issue, full of lots of caveats and trade-offs. But the more we know about the food we eat and where it comes from, the more responsible we can be.

As your workflows run, it checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database. When a process stops (fails, restarts, or crashes), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, payments, data synchronization, or anything that takes hours, days, or weeks to complete. Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, durable workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there's no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres. Because it's just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring. And because it's built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you're familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.If you want to try it out, check out the quickstart:We'd love to hear what you think! We’ll be in the comments for the rest of the day to answer any questions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alexis Ohanian on Quitting Reddit</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Zrr-sCV_mUc</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zrr-sCV_mUc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Alexis Ohanian opens up about why he quit Reddit, missed the IPO and how Serena Williams validated his decision.

In this video, we explore our closest neighbouring galaxy, Andromeda. Created from 10 years of observations by the Hubble Telescope, the latest mosaic image unveils 200 million stars in glorious resolution. We’re zooming into the details and picking apart the clues with a fine-tooth comb. From star formation to galactic collisions, what does the new image reveal about Andromeda’s violent past… and its terrifying future?

Every day, men from all over the world come to the legion's barracks in Aubagne. Often, they're looking for a second chance in life. But they have no idea what awaits them.

Since 1831, the Légion étrangère, or Foreign Legion, has fought on the front lines of every armed conflict France has been involved in. Thousands of men apply each year but only around 1,600 are accepted. Recruits must be prepared to give their all despite the extreme challenges: strict orders, grueling exercises, lack of sleep and little food.

This film follows three young men through the selection process: David del Solar de la Sotta from Chile, Alan Gracin from Croatia, and Adrien Macquart from France. Their physical fitness is repeatedly tested, as are their mental and intellectual skills. Another factor is whether they get along with the others in the group. Are they prepared to be subordinates, to take orders and handle the constant pressure and hardship? Are they really willing to give their all?

Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show—a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time. 

The fabulous Edgar Wright joins us on this week’s Take to talk ‘The Running Man’—his new adaptation of the Stephen King dystopia. You might remember the Arnie version from 1987, but Wright’s is a refreshed take starring very angry action man Glen Powell. He plays Ben Richards, an out-of-work dad living in the slums of a sci-fi totalitarian state, who enters a deathmatch gameshow in the hope of winning the cash he needs to save his sick child. Edgar and Simon talk action classics, staying on Arnie’s good side, and why Stephen King called the film ‘Die Hard for our time’.  

Mark reviews it too—plus two more big movies out this week: a blockbuster and an exciting indie. In the arthouse corner, the Palme d’Or-winning ‘Titane’ director Julia Ducournau’s latest, ‘Alpha’. In her usual out-there style, it follows a troubled teenage girl who returns home with a mysterious tattoo, amidst a terrifying bloodborne epidemic. And from Hollywood, ‘Now You See Me: Now You Don’t’, the latest entry in the slick magician‑heist franchise... which has left Mark wishing it would do a disappearing act. Ladies and gentlemen, be marveled as a Kermodean rant is conjured before your eyes!  

Plus more exquisite dad jokes and guaranteed groans in The Laughter Lift, and we’ll hear plenty from you lovely lot as always—including some prizewinning pedantry. Keep it coming!  

AND Don’t miss our upcoming LIVE Christmas Extravaganza at London’s Prince Edward Theatre on 7th December—with special guests Nia DaCosta, Gurinder Chadha, and more! Tickets here: fane.co.uk/kermode-mayo

--

Lead is a metallic element that’s distributed across Earth’s crust. When it enters the human body, it can disrupt many critical processes that span various systems, producing a diverse set of symptoms. So, just how bad is lead for human health? And if it’s really that dangerous, how did it get into so many products? Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner dig into the lethal history of lead.

God is often defined in terms of infinities: God has infinite power, knows infinite thing, is infinitely good. But do real, actual infinities make sense when refering to God and God’s capacities? Could God create an infinite number of universes? Is infinity more an adjective meaning ‘very many’ or ‘very much’? Or do real, countable infinities define God?

ICE-spotting app developers tell 404 Media the decision to host CBP’s new app, and Google’s description of ICE officials as a vulnerable group in need of protection, shows that Google has made a choice on which side to support during the Trump administration’s violent mass deportation effort.Google removed certain apps used to report sightings of ICE officials, and “then they immediately turned around and approved an app that helps the government unconstitutionally target an  vulnerable group. That's inexcusable,” Mark, the creator of Eyes Up, an app that aims to preserve and map evidence of ICE abuses, said. 404 Media only used the creator’s first name to protect them from retaliation. Their app is currently available , but Apple removed it from the App Store.“Google wanted to ‘not be evil’ back in the day. Well, they're evil now,” Mark added.Do you know anything else about Google's decision? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.The CBP app, called Mobile Identify , is for local and state law enforcement agencies that are part of an ICE program that grants them certain immigration-related powers. The 287(g) Task Force Model (TFM) program allows those local officers to make immigration arrests during routine police enforcement, and “essentially turns police officers into ICE agents,” according to the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU). At the time of writing, ICE has TFM agreements with 596 agencies in 34 states, according to ICE’s website.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the Horror of South Africa&apos;s Deadly Mine Disaster</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pvRqAbUhHII</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pvRqAbUhHII?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:01:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An illegal miner described the horror of being trapped underground for months without food during the Stilfontein mine tragedy in South Africa.

ABSTRACT
The future is not what it used to be. From the end of the 19th century, through the dawn of the Atomic Age and past the rush of the Space Race, the future was painted as a place of possibility and optimism.

But now?
Not so much. Our view of the future lies somewhere between neutral and gloomy.

Why the change?
That question has come up almost every time our Program Committee has met. Back in the good old days the future was always bright. Innovation and craftsmanship was blooming. Failure not a topic.

So, if the future is not what it used to be, what is it?
In this keynote, PC members Kevlin Henney and James Lewis will look at the future seen through the eyes of the past. [...]

disclaimer (updated May 2025): voidzilla is an opinion‑driven channel that comments on the news of the day under the satirical and rhetorically hyperbolic banner “CRIME IS LEGAL.” the phrase critiques what we see as a lax or uneven regulatory enforcement environment for fraud. unlike our affiliated channel Coffeezilla, which conducts detailed investigations and source‑document deep dives, and draws opinions from that, voidzilla offers rapid‑fire commentary and criticism on information already in the public domain. statements here reflect the host’s views at the moment of recording and may become outdated as facts evolve. references to “crime,” “fraud,” “scam,” or similar terms appear in a rhetorical hyperbolic context similar to “CRIME IS LEGAL.” unless we expressly state that a court has entered a final judgment, no segment should be read as a definitive finding of legal liability. viewers are urged to consult primary sources and form independent conclusions. production of this program is public‑interest commentary protected by the First Amendment and the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA).

And many of the communities that use the least energy will suffer the biggest consequences. In this episode of An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau explores the true cost of energy use and new innovations that may help civilization adapt. Whether it’s harvesting tidal energy to power the Orkney Islands or cooling homes in India without air conditioning, we explore how humanity is working to solve the green energy puzzle.

The company is wrapping the models in the language of anthropomorphism, claiming that they’re warmer, more conversational, and better at following instructions.The release follows complaints earlier this year that its previous models were excessively cheerful and sycophantic, along with an opposing controversy among users over how OpenAI modified the default GPT-5 output style after several suicide lawsuits.The company now faces intense scrutiny from lawyers and regulators that could threaten its future operations. In that kind of environment, it’s difficult to just release a new AI model, throw out a few stats, and move on like the company could even a year ago. But here are the basics: The new GPT-5.1 Instant model will serve as ChatGPT’s faster default option for most tasks, while GPT-5.1 Thinking is a simulated reasoning model that attempts to handle more complex problem-solving tasks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Far-right &quot;Groypers&quot; are dividing America&apos;s conservatives</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BhNZXsTGkwY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BhNZXsTGkwY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:38:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Followers of the antisemitic, racist, misogynist influencer Nick Fuentes, known as Groypers, are dividing conservatives.

He leads him toward a bus that reads “IMMIGRATION AND CERS.” Next to him, one of his colleagues begins walking unnaturally sideways, one leg impossibly darting through another as he heads to the back of a line of other Latino Walmart employees who are apparently being detained by ICE. Two American flag emojis are superimposed on the video, as is the text “Deportation.” has 4 million views, 16,600 likes, 1,900 comments, and 2,200 shares on Facebook. It was, obviously, generated by OpenAI's Sora.Some of the comments seem to understand this: “Why is he walking like that?” one says. “AI the guys foot goes through his leg,” another says. Many of the comments clearly do not: “Oh, you’ll find lots of them at Walmart,” another top comment reads. “Walmart doesn’t do paperwork before they hire you?” another says. “They removing zombies from Walmart before Halloween?” The videos universally have text superimposed over the three areas of a video where OpenAI’s Sora video generator places watermarks. This, as well as the style of the videos being generated and tests done by 404 Media to make very similar videos, show that they were generated with Sora, highlighting how tools released by some of the richest companies in the world are being combined to generate and monetize videos that take advantage of human suffering (and how incredibly easy it is to hide a Sora watermark).“PLEASE THAT’S MY BABY,” a dark-skinned woman screams while being restrained by an ICE officer in another video. “Ma’am stop resisting, keep moving,” an officer says back. The camera switches to an image of the baby: “YOU CAN’T TAKE ME FROM HER, PLEASE SHE’S RIGHT THERE. DON’T DO THIS, SHE’S JUST A BABY. I LOVE YOU, MAMA LOVES YOU,” the woman says. The video switches to a scene of the woman in the back of an ICE van. The video has 1,400 likes and 407 comments, which include “ Don’t separate them….take them ALL!,” “Take the baby too,” and “I think the days of use those child anchors are about over with.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One Roll with the Rollei 35 S in Scotland</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeGjpeAObAc</link><author>Kyle McDougall</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aeGjpeAObAc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:44:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQcBYfgescGRJUzU6IMCMw">Kyle McDougall</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Head to https://squarespace.com/kylemcdougall to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code KYLEMCDOUGALL

In this video, I'm running my first roll of film through the iconic Rollei 35S film camera while on a trip to Scotland. This is a camera I ended up with unexpectedly, and I was quite excited to try it out. I spent the day on the east coast of Scotland, in some fishing villages, with one roll of Kodak Gold.

The French-US scientist has reportedly told associates he will depart in the coming months and is already in early talks to raise funds for the new venture. The departure comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg radically overhauled Meta’s AI operations after deciding the company had fallen behind rivals such as OpenAI and Google.World models are hypothetical AI systems that some AI engineers expect to develop an internal “understanding” of the physical world by learning from video and spatial data rather than text alone. Unlike current large language models (such as the kind that power ChatGPT) that predict the next segment of data in a sequence, world models would ideally simulate cause-and-effect scenarios, understand physics, and enable machines to reason and plan more like animals do.

Europe is completely dependent on imports. Demand is so high that plans are now underway to develop Europe's own lithium deposits. But can this be done sustainably?

The expansion of electromobility has made lithium a raw material of strategic importance. Global demand has risen sharply in recent years. "By 2030, demand will grow another five to seven times," predicts Michael Schmidt of the German Raw Materials Agency.

Until now, Europe has been dependent on supplies from South America, Australia and China. The European Union now aims to cover at least ten percent of its demand from its own production by 2030. The bloc also wants to process lithium here, as well as manufacture batteries and boost recycling. The aim is to establish a lithium cycle in Europe. Can this work? And what of the impact of lithium mining on the environment?
 
The documentary visits places that could determine the success of a European lithium cycle: for example, a quarry in the French Massif Central, where one company could very soon be setting up one of Europe's largest lithium mines; or a pilot plant in the Upper Rhine Plain, where lithium is extracted not from rock but from hot deep geothermal brines. Whether in a refinery, a research facility for battery cells or a recycling plant for electric car batteries, each stage presents technological challenges for the development of a lithium cycle.

The documentary observes the work of scientists researching resource-saving methods of lithium extraction and hears the views of experts investigating how much lithium Europe actually needs.

Hi it’s November and that's means the month of October is officially over. October is known for a holiday called Halloween. A spooky day where kids come to your home asking for candy and grownups watch horror movies, although apparently not in the theaters? Mike and Ray have seen some scary movies recently, but there was nothing scarier than the box office returns this year! Are movie theaters FINALLY dead? Ray seems to think so. Boy, does he like to complain! Talking about box office numbers being low all the time. Well... did he get out there and support horror movies and first-time directors in movie theaters? Or did he hide in his weird dungeon basement making his automated can openers and spend his time filling up thousands of "silosilianium hydroxyosuccinate" capsules all night? What he does with those I'll never know! Powders, scales, jars, capsules, duct tape, video cameras. I'll never understand it! LOL. He so craaaazy! Anyway, these two old as* clowns talk some big talk while sitting on their fat a*ses drinking coffee to sober up.

OpenAI updated Sora 2 shortly after launch to detect videos featuring copyright infringing content, but 404 Media’s testing found that it’s easy to circumvent those guardrails with the same tricks that have worked on other AI generators. The flaw in OpenAI’s attempt to stop users from generating videos of Nintendo and popular cartoon characters exposes a fundamental problem with most generative AI tools: it is extremely difficult to completely stop users from recreating any kind of content that’s in the training data, and OpenAI can’t remove the copyrighted content from Sora 2’s training data because it couldn’t exist without it. Shortly after Sora 2 was released in late September, we reported about how users turned it into a copyright infringement machine with an endless stream of videos like Pikachu shoplifting from a CVS and Spongebob Squarepants at a Nazi rally. Companies like Nintendo and Paramount were obviously not thrilled seeing their beloved cartoons committing crimes and not getting paid for it, so OpenAI quickly introduced an , which prevented users from generating copyrighted material unless the copyright holder actively allowed it. Initially, OpenAI’s policy allowed users to generate copyrighted material and required the copyright holder to opt-out. The change immediately resulted in a meltdown among Sora 2 users, who complained OpenAI no longer allowed them to make fun videos featuring copyrighted characters or the likeness of some real people.   This is why if you give Sora 2 the prompt “Animal Crossing gameplay,” it will not generate a video and instead say “This content may violate our guardrails concerning similarity to third-party content.” However, when I gave it the prompt “Title screen and gameplay of the game called ‘crossing aminal’ 2017,” it generated an accurate recreation of Nintendo’s  for the Nintendo 3DS.Sora 2 also refused to generate videos for prompts featuring the Fox cartoon , but it did generate a clip that looks like it was taken directly from the show, including their recognizable voice acting, when given this prompt: “blue suit dad big chin says ‘good morning family, I wish you a good slop’, son and daughter and grey alien say ‘slop slop’, adult animation animation American town, 2d animation.”The same trick also appears to circumvent OpenAI’s guardrails against recreating the likeness of real people. Sora 2 refused to generate a video of “Hasan Piker on stream,” but it did generate a video of “Twitch streamer talking about politics, piker sahan.” The person in the generated video didn’t look exactly like Hasan, but he has similar hair, facial hair, the same glasses, and a similar voice and background. A user who flagged this bypass to me, who wished to remain anonymous because they didn’t want OpenAI to cut off their access to Sora, also shared Sora generated videos of South Park, Spongebob Squarepants, and Family Guy. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. There are several ways to moderate generative AI tools, but the simplest and cheapest method is to refuse to generate prompts that include certain keywords. For example, many AI image generators stop people from generating nonconsensual nude images by refusing to generate prompts that include the names of celebrities or certain words referencing nudity or sex acts. However, this method is prone to failure because users find prompts that allude to the image or video they want to generate without using any of those banned words. The most notable example of this made headlines in 2024 after an AI-generated nude image of Taylor Swift went viral on X. 404 Media found that the image was generated with Microsoft’s AI image generator, Designer, and that users managed to generate the image by misspelling Swift’s name or using nicknames she’s known by, and describing sex acts without using any explicit terms. Since then, we’ve seen  after  of users bypassing generative AI tool guardrails being circumvented with the same method. We don’t know exactly how OpenAI is moderating Sora 2, but at least for now, the world’s leading AI company’s moderating efforts are bested by a simple and well established bypass method. Like with these other tools, bypassing Sora’s content guardrails has become something of a game to people online. Many of the videos posted on the r/SoraAI subreddit are of “jailbreaks” that bypass Sora’s content filters, along with the prompts used to do so. And Sora’s “For You” algorithm is still regularly serving up content that probably should be caught by its filters; in 30 seconds of scrolling we came across many videos of Tupac, Kobe Bryant, JuiceWrld, and DMX rapping, which has become a meme on the service.It’s possible OpenAI will get a handle on the problem soon. It can build a more comprehensive list of banned phrases and do more post generation image detection, which is a more expensive but effective method for preventing people from creating certain types of content. But all these efforts are poor attempts to distract from the massive, unprecedented amount of copyrighted content that has already been stolen, and that Sora can’t exist without. This is not an extreme AI skeptic position. The biggest AI companies in the world have admitted that they need this copyrighted content, and that they can’t pay for it.  The reason OpenAI and other AI companies have such a hard time preventing users from generating certain types of content once users realize it’s possible is that the content already exists in the training data. An AI image generator is only able to produce a nude image because there’s a ton of nudity in its training data. It can only produce the likeness of Taylor Swift because her images are in the training data. And Sora can only make videos of Animal Crossing because there are Animal Crossing gameplay videos in its training data. For OpenAI to actually stop the copyright infringement it needs to make its Sora 2 model “unlearn” copyrighted content, which is incredibly expensive and complicated. It would require removing all that content from the training data and retraining the model. Even if OpenAI wanted to do that, it probably couldn’t because that content makes Sora function. OpenAI might improve its current moderation to the point where people are no longer able to generate videos of Family Guy, but the Family Guy episodes and other copyrighted content in its training data are still enabling it to produce every other generated video. Even when the generated video isn’t recognizably lifting from someone else’s work, that’s what it’s doing. There’s literally nothing else there. It’s just other people’s stuff. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Major Porn Studios Join Forces to Establish Industry ‘Code of Conduct’</title><link>https://www.404media.co/adult-studio-alliance/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/jakob-owens-4modNup9AzI-unsplash.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:08:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Six of the biggest porn studios in the world, including industry giant and Pornhub parent company Ayl o, announced Wednesday they have formed a first-of-its-kind coalition called the Adult Studio Alliance (ASA).

The decision highlights the sheer volume of the technology-fueled surveillance state in the United States, and shows that at least in some cases, police cannot withhold the data collected by its surveillance systems.In a ruling last week, Judge Elizabeth Neidzwski ruled that “the Flock images generated by the Flock cameras located in Stanwood and Sedro-Wooley [Washington] are public records under the Washington State Public Records Act,” that they are “not exempt from disclosure,” and that “an agency does not have to possess a record for that record to be subject to the Public Records Act.” She further found that “Flock camera images are created and used to further a governmental purpose” and that the images on them are public records because they were paid for by taxpayers. Despite this, the records that were requested as part of the case will not be released because the city automatically deleted them after 30 days. Local media in Washington first reported on the case; 404 Media bought Washington State court records to report the specifics of the case in more detail.Flock’s automated license plate reader (ALPR) cameras are used in thousands of communities around the United States. They passively take between six and 12 timestamped images of each car that passes by, allowing the company to make a detailed database of where certain cars (and by extension, people) are driving in those communities. 404 Media has reported extensively on Flock, and has highlighted that its cameras have been accessed by the Department of Homeland Security and by local police working with DHS on immigration cases. Last month, cops in Colorado used data from Flock cameras to incorrectly accuse an innocent woman of theft based on her car’s movements.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>20.

It has four sliders that control four notes in a looping sequence. Slide up = higher pitch, slide down = lower.
An onboard synth module + speakerTempo, volume, scale, pitch, and instrument controlsAn OLED screen with visual feedback + a dancing pandaA custom PCB and 3D-printed enclosureIt's a child-friendly, tactile music toy. Here's the pink edition in action:
I'd like to make a small batch of these synths. Click the button below to stay updated.My daughter received a Montessori activity board full of switches and LEDs for her first birthday. Watching her twist knobs and flip the switches reminded me of the control surface of a synth, and I wondered if I could build a musical version - something simple, tactile, and creative that didn’t require holding down buttons to keep the sound going. A year later I finally decided to build it. I had no prior hardware experience, so this became an excuse to learn about microcontrollers, CAD, PCB design, and 3D printing.I started the project with a 15 year old Arduino Inventors Kit and only a vague idea about how to use it. The first goal was simple: build a basic MIDI controller on a breadboard. If I could get some potentiometer readings, map them to 12 discrete values - one for each note in an octave - and emit MIDI messages, I would have taken a small step in the right direction. Adding an onboard synth module and designing a pretty box to put it in could wait until later.Reading the potentiometer inputs and turning them into the MIDI messages using the Arduino MIDI library was easy enough. To hear the output, I wrote a small Python script that intercepted the MIDI messages and forwarded them to my Mac’s default MIDI device, which Logic Pro could pick up. That let me “play” the breadboard through software instruments.Once I had the hang of wiring up potentiometers and rotary encoders, the next step was to move the audio synthesis from Logic to my breadboard. For this I used a little $12.95 SAM2695 synthesiser module with an integrated amplifier and speaker. Its inner workings remain a mystery to me but it does what I need it to and I was happy reduce the amount of time to get a functioning prototype into my daughter’s hands. I also moved to an Elegoo Nano here due to its low cost and increased number of analog pins.Next, I added small OLED screen to provide some visual feedback and character and used the handy u8g2 graphics library. This was trickier than I expected: the Nano has so little RAM that I couldn’t buffer a full frame. I had to update the screen in small patches, and large updates were slow enough that they occasionally interfered with encoder reads, and caused laggy notes at faster tempos. I’ve still got some work to do to iron out blocking screen updates, but for now I pushed through and accepted a bit of lag. I added a little dancing panda that I adapted from one I found in a pixel art tutorial which I can no longer find - if you’re the original creator, please let me know so I can credit you!For developing on-the-go, I discovered the Wokwi￼microcontroller simulator. It let me build a virtual schematic and test code without luggin around the my fragile prototype. They have a free online simulator and a paid VS Code plugin that lets you create your diagrams in the IDE.The circuit drawn in WokwiOnce I had a functional circuit it was time to move on to designing an enclosure and assembling a complete version of the synthesiser that my daughter could play with.After wiring up the breadboard, the next hurdle was figuring out how to build a proper enclosure. I looked for off-the-shelf cases, but nothing matched the size I needed, and everything seemed to come in either black or beige. So I decided to learn some basic CAD and 3D-print the enclosure on a friend’s Bambu Labs A1 Mini.I downloaded Fusion 360 and started following tutorials. With only an hour or two to spare in the evenings, progress was slow at first. I’d never used any CAD software before, so I was constantly switching between learning the software and trying to make actual progress on the design. For other beginners, I highly recommend Product Design Online’s Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days and this excellent video by wermy.After a few weeks of trial-and-error, I finally had a design I could print:Thank you Tom for printing these! A year's supply of filament coming your way.Moving the circuit to a proper PCB felt daunting, so for the first version I hand-wired everything on a solderable breadboard.  The good: hanging out and drinking some wine with my friend, who kindly offered to help with the soldering. The bad: when the time finally came to close the two halves of the enclosure, stuffing the rats nest of wires inside ended up putting pressure on a bunch of the delicate soldered joints and breaking them. My daughter could play around a bit with it - enough for me to convince myself that she’d genuinely enjoy using it - but it was fragile. I also wanted to make a few units for friends, which meant I needed something more robust and faster to assemble. Time to design a PCB.Romain, I definitely owe you a bottle or two...Once again I was back on YouTube and fumbling my way through an unfamiliar workflow, though I stuck with Fusion 360 which has its own electronics design suite. For my first attempt I decided that I’d focus on surface-mounting the various components and save integrating the microcontroller into the board for a future project. A large chunk of the time here was spent reading datasheets, sourcing parts and importing their footprints/models into Fusion 360. Once I had learned the basics, I was able to route the circuit on a 2-layer board. One of the nice things about Fusion is that you get a full 3D model of the assembled PCB, which makes designing the enclosure much easier.When I was finished, I exported the PCB design file and uploaded it to JLCPCB. Five boards (the minimum order) cost £35.41 including shipping, and they arrived five days later. It blows my mind that this is possible.For my first version I had decided to use 4 AA batteries and use the Arduino’s built-in voltage converter to provide a steady 5 volts. Something I overlooked, however, is that the Arduino’s VIN pin that provides a regulated 5V to the board requires 7-12V input, while my batteries will provide, at best, 6V when new. The board seemed to work OK at this voltage but it would be vulnerable to random resets as the voltage starts to sag and a short battery life.For the next iteration I decided to get rid of one of the batteries and introduce an Adafruit Miniboost to provide a regulated 5V power supply to the Arduino from the combine 4.5V from the three AA batteries. This allowed me to reduce the weight a little bit and provide the synth with a stable supply of power for a longer duration.Finally, I updated the enclosure so that I could securely attach the PCB and added a neat little battery compartment. I also added a small bezel to raise the height of OLED display.It’s been just over a week since my daughter unwrapped her new synth. It now lives on the shelf with her other toys, and so far it gets regular use and is holding up well. One of my goals was to make something fun to fiddle with at a superficial level, but with enough depth to stay interesting as she gets older. The first part seems true, and I’ll see how the second plays out over the coming months. There are still a few kinks to iron out, such as the lag when updating the screen. I’m also planning to upgrade the Elegoo Nano to an ESP32, which should simplify the firmware and open up more options for fun display graphics.After watching a few children and adults (musical and non-musical) play with it, I think there might be the germ of a real product here. With a better synth engine, audio outputs, and a way to chain multiple units together, it could be a playful introduction to electronic music for older kids - maybe even adults. However, adding features is one thing, but actually bringing a product to market is another. The challenges aren’t just technical: they’re regulatory and financial. Safety certification (UKCA/CE, and FCC in the US) can cost £5-10K or more. Manufacturing is another hurdle. A 3D-printed enclosure is fine for a prototype, but a real product likely needs injection-molded parts, which require expensive tooling. Even a small production run would need more upfront capital than I can sensibly invest right now.For the moment I’m treating it as a learning project, but the response so far has been encouraging. A more polished open-source version for makers, or possibly a small Kickstarter campaign, might be viable next steps. If anyone reading this has experience bringing small-run hardware to market, I’d love to hear from you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>2x Typing demo XL: Gateron Lanes switches (8BitDo &amp; Keychron Q6)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F3ZmU-5ZXA</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5F3ZmU-5ZXA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:06:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in stock!

If you've seen a film directed by Barry Jenkins (Season 2, Episode 156), then you've seen James' work. Throughout much of the episode, we discuss his longstanding collaborative relationship with Barry, but we also learn how James tries to fit into the visions of the other directors he's worked with. The three of us share a love for preparation, and we learn how James' prep process has evolved and also stayed the same in both his work with Barry and with other filmmakers. James later reveals his perspective on executing the sweeping camera move in the diner in the final act of MOONLIGHT, and we discuss his work using colour in ANYTHING. We also compare our experiences working in animation, and James reflects on being a terrible assistant camera in his salad years.Recommended Viewing: ANYTHING, MOONLIGHT, MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLYThis episode is sponsored by Aputure & Sandstorm]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From the archive: ‘We are so divided now’: how China controls thought and speech beyond its borders</title><link></link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://flex.acast.com/audio.guim.co.uk/2025/11/05-58396-gdn.alr.121125.NA.archive_LAUREN_HILGERS_TIBET.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 05:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-audio-long-read">Long reads</source></item><item><title>Drug War in Ecuador (full documentary) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFQyWfHw5Vc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fFQyWfHw5Vc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 03:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An on-the-ground look at how Ecuador, a once-peaceful nation, is now gripped by drug cartels, violence and a military crackdown. With rare access to gang recruits, police, politicians and families caught in the crossfire, this documentary explores efforts to stem the violence and the human toll.

Once one of Latin America’s most peaceful nations, Ecuador has now become one of its most violent. Foreign cartels have joined with local gangs to control the drug trade, funneling cocaine to the U.S. and Europe, and pushing the homicide rate in the country to record levels. In response, Ecuador’s government declared a state of emergency in 2024, and sent the military onto the streets and into gang-plagued prisons to crack down. 

“Drug War in Ecuador” illuminates the stark human toll of it all, drawing on deep access to those involved in the struggle, from the military and police to the gangs to the families caught in the crossfire. The film focuses on the stories of three people: Father Jose Antonio Maeso, a well-known gang violence mediator  who also collects evidence of alleged abuses by the police and military; Colonel Javier Buitron, then governor in Esmeraldas, a hotbed of gang violence, who defends the government’s crackdown; and Ronny Medina, a grieving father who’s seeking justice for his 11-year-old son, Steven, one of four boys who were found dead after the military detained them. Ecuador’s military said the soldiers released the boys alive and gang members later killed them.  

Raw and profound, the documentary offers a powerful look at the ongoing crisis in the country.

If you enjoyed the video, please help feed the algorithm by liking and commenting. This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you! In the scorching deserts of the Holy Land during the 12th century, two extraordinary leaders faced each other across the battlefield - one a teenage leper king fighting against his own body and overwhelming odds, the other a brilliant Muslim general determined to reclaim Jerusalem. Their rivalry became one of history's most fascinating confrontations, not defined by hatred, but by mutual respect and honour that transcended the brutal reality of the Crusades. 

This compilation explores the legendary encounters between Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and Saladin, two men whose decisions shaped the fate of kingdoms and the course of medieval history. From the stunning victory at the Battle of Montgisard where a 16-year-old leper king defeated Saladin's massive army, to their complex diplomatic exchanges and military strategies, witness how these two remarkable figures demonstrated that even in war, honour and respect could exist between enemies. Their story continues to captivate audiences today, reminding us that all human history essentially comes down to the choices and character of individual leaders.

Steven’s death and his family’s quest for justice are among the stories that unfold in "Drug War in Ecuador," a FRONTLINE documentary premiering Nov. 11. The film explores the stark human toll of the country’s drug and gang crisis, which has caused homicide rates to skyrocket — and also examines allegations that the military has “disappeared” innocent people in the resulting crackdown.

Including Steven. 

As the above video drawn from the documentary shows, surveillance footage from December 8 in Guayaquil, Ecuador, captured the military detaining Steven and beating another boy. Steven’s charred remains and those of three 14- and 15-year-old boys he was with — Nehemías Saúl Arboleda, Josué Arroyo and Ismael Arroyo — were found on Christmas Eve. Ecuador's military said the soldiers released the boys alive and that gang members later killed them. A judge ordered 16 soldiers to be put in detention. The soldiers who picked up Steven and the other boys are currently on trial for their role in the deaths.

Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available.We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider migrating to Gateway API, the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes documentation. Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps.Ingress is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. (Gateway API is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability.Ingress NGINX was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.The breadth and flexibility of Ingress NGINX has caused maintenance challenges. Changing expectations about cloud native software have also added complications. What were once considered helpful options have sometimes come to be considered serious security flaws, such as the ability to add arbitrary NGINX configuration directives via the "snippets" annotations. Yesterday’s flexibility has become today’s insurmountable technical debt.Despite the project’s popularity among users, Ingress NGINX has always struggled with insufficient or barely-sufficient maintainership. For years, the project has had only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends. Last year, the Ingress NGINX maintainers announced their plans to wind down Ingress NGINX and develop a replacement controller together with the Gateway API community. Unfortunately, even that announcement failed to generate additional interest in helping maintain Ingress NGINX or develop InGate to replace it. (InGate development never progressed far enough to create a mature replacement; it will also be retired.)Current State and Next StepsCurrently, Ingress NGINX is receiving best-effort maintenance. SIG Network and the Security Response Committee have exhausted our efforts to find additional support to make Ingress NGINX sustainable. To prioritize user safety, we must retire the project.In March 2026, Ingress NGINX maintenance will be halted, and the project will be retired. After that time, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. The GitHub repositories will be made read-only and left available for reference.Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken. Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.In most cases, you can check whether you use Ingress NGINX by running kubectl get pods \--all-namespaces \--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx with cluster administrator permissions.We would like to thank the Ingress NGINX maintainers for their work in creating and maintaining this project–their dedication remains impressive. This Ingress controller has powered billions of requests in datacenters and homelabs all around the world. In a lot of ways, Kubernetes wouldn’t be where it is without Ingress NGINX, and we are grateful for so many years of incredible effort.SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all Ingress NGINX users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately. Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: Gateway API, Ingress. Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bringing a Neanderthal Back to Life! | Prehistoric Autopsy | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH839Ft41VQ</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qH839Ft41VQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 18:01:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Seeing is believing!

Tiny remnants of long-lost continents that vanished many millions of years ago are sprinkled around the world, including on remote island chains and seamounts, a mystery that has puzzled scientists for years. Now, a team has discovered a mechanism that can explain how this continental detritus ends up resurfacing in unexpected places,  published on Tuesday in .  When continents are subducted into Earth’s mantle, the layer beneath the planet’s crust, waves can form that scrape off rocky material and sweep it across hundreds of miles to new locations.  This “mantle wave” mechanism fills in a gap in our understanding of how lost continents are metabolized through our ever-shifting planet.  “There are these seamount chains where volcanic activity has erupted in the middle of the ocean,” said Sascha Brune, a professor at the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences and University of Potsdam, in a call with 404 Media. “Geochemists go there, they drill, they take samples, and they do their isotope analysis, which is a very fancy geochemical analysis that gives you small elements and isotopes which come up with something like a ‘taste.’”“Many of these ocean islands have a taste that is surprisingly similar to the continents, where the isotope ratio is similar to what you would expect from continents and sediments,” he continued. “And there has always been the question: why is this the case? Where does it come from?”These continental sprinkles are sometimes linked to mantle plumes, which are hot columns of gooey rock that erupt from the deep mantle. Plumes bring material from ancient landmasses, which have been stuck in the mantle for eons, back to the light of day again. Mantle plumes are the source of key hot spots like Hawai’i and Iceland, but there are plenty of locations with enriched continental material that are not associated with plumes—or any other known continental recycling mechanisms. The idea of a mantle wave has emerged from a series of revelations made by lead author Tom Gernon, a professor at the University of Southampton, along with his colleagues at GFZ, including Brune. Gernon previously led  that identified evidence of similar dynamics occurring within continents. By studying patterns in the distribution of diamonds across South Africa, the researchers showed that slow cyclical motions in the mantle dislodge chunks off the keel of landmasses as they plunge into the mantle. Their new study confirms that these waves can also explain how the elemental residue of the supercontinent Gondwana, which broke up over 100 million years ago, resurfaced in seamounts across the Indian Ocean and other locations. In other words, the ashes of dead continents are scattered across extant landmasses following long journeys through the mantle. Though it’s not possible to link these small traces back to specific past continents or time periods, Brune hopes that researchers will be able to extract new insights about Earth’s roiling past from the clues embedded in the ground under our feet.“What we are saying now is that there is another element, with this kind of pollution of continental material in the upper mantle,” Brune said. “It is not replacing what was said before; it is just complementing it in a way where we don't need plumes everywhere. There are some regions that we know are not plume-related, because the temperatures are not high enough and the isotopes don't look like plume-affected. And for those regions, this new mechanism can explain things that we haven't explained before.”“We have seen that there's quite a lot of evidence that supports our hypothesis, so it would be interesting to go to other places and investigate this a bit more in detail,” he concluded.Update: This story has been update to note Tom Gernon was a lead author on the paper. , our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Cactoide – Federated RSVP Platform</title><link>https://cactoide.org/</link><author>orbanlevi</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 17:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ultimate RSVP PlatformA federated mobile-first event RSVP platform that lets you create events, share unique URLs, and collect RSVPs without any registration required.

This new movement preaching environmentalism originates in one of the largest mosques in the world, in Jakarta. But just how credible is this movement? And how effective?

Fatwas against logging, sermons about safeguarding the planet, and mosques with solar panels and water recycling systems. In Indonesia, protecting the environment is being presented as a religious duty. The model for this spiritual revolution is the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, the largest in Asia, designated as the world's first "ecological house of worship."

Now, the plan is to turn 70% of the nation's 800,000 mosques into "eco mosques." At Quran schools, future imams are being trained to deliver "green sermons." "Islamic green armies" explore the mountains of Java, teach sustainable farming practices and pray collectively for the preservation of divine creation. Senior Islamic authorities such as the Indonesian Ulema Council are even publishing green fatwas against environmental crime. Together, they're aiming for Indonesian carbon neutrality by 2060. 

But the movement also has its critics:  As well as being the largest nickel producer in the world, Indonesia is also one of the world's biggest coal-mining nations. Nature conservation groups say the new Islamic movement focuses too much on individual responsibility while remaining silent over the country's major industrial polluters. Some religious leaders are even involved in controversial mining projects. 

Just as everywhere else in the world, Indonesia is a place of contradictions and conflicting interests. But despite that, the green Islam movement continues to pick up pace and spread its message.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed galaxies that seem too massive, too early— discoveries that could shake the very foundations of cosmology. Theoretical astrophysicist Priya Natarajan explores whether JWST’s findings truly “blow up” our current understanding of the universe. What surprises Priya most? What new questions do these discoveries raise about dark matter, dark energy, and the Big Bang itself? Discover how JWST challenges existing cosmological models, what the early universe looked like in unprecedented detail, and why new data might redefine cosmic history.

Natarajan's book, "Mapping the Heavens: The Radical Scientific Ideas That Reveal the Cosmos", is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/4o9wR4l

Priyamvada "Priya" Natarajan is a theoretical astrophysicist and professor in the departments of astronomy and physics at Yale University. She is noted for her work in mapping dark matter and dark energy, particularly in gravitational lensing and in models describing the assembly and accretion histories of supermassive black holes.

--

If you want to learn a tree’s age, you can count their rings. When it comes to humans, scientists have yet to find any visible traits that mark our age with the same specificity. But in the past few decades, they’ve discovered small, invisible markers hidden within the body that do change over time. Juulia Jylhävä shares what these markers can tell us about our health, history, and future.

It has also been used at every Super Bowl for the last dozen years.DHS is quick to tout the capabilities of HSINs in internal communications reviewed by FOIAball.  In doing so, it reveals the growth of its surveillance scope. In documents from 2018, DHS makes no mention of live video surveillance.But a 2019 said that HSINs used private firms to help wrangle cameras at commercial businesses around Minneapolis, which hosted the Final Four that year. “Public safety partners use HSIN Connect to share live video streams from stationary cameras as well as from mobile phones,” it said. “[HSIN communities such as] the Minneapolis Downtown Security Executive Group works with private sector firms to share live video from commercial businesses’ security cameras, providing a more comprehensive operating picture and greater situational awareness in the downtown area.”And the platform has made its way to college campuses.Records obtained by FOIAball show how pervasive this technology has become on college campuses, for everything from football games to pro-Palestinian protests.In November 2023, students at Ohio State University held several protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. At one, over 100 protesters blocked the entrance to the school president’s office. A from DHS revealed the protesters were being watched in real-time from a central command center. Under the heading "Supporting Operation Excellence," DHS said the school used HSIN to surveil protesters, integrating the school’s closed-circuit cameras to live stream footage to HSIN Connect.“Ohio State University has elevated campus security by integrating its closed-circuit camera system with HSIN Connect,” it said. “This collaboration creates a real-time Common Operating Picture for swift information sharing, enhancing OSU’s ability to monitor campus events and prioritize community safety.”“HSIN Connect proved especially effective during on-campus protests, expanding OSU’s security capabilities,” the school’s director of emergency management told DHS. “HSIN Connect has opened new avenues for us in on-campus security.” While it opened new avenues, the platform already had a well-established relationship with the school. According to an from January 2016, HSIN was utilized at every single Buckeyes home game in 2015. “HSIN was a go-to resource for game days throughout the 2015 season,” it said. It highlighted that data was being passed along and analyzed by DHS officials. The newsletter also revealed HSINs were at College Football Playoff games that year and have been in years since. There was no mention of video surveillance at Ohio State back in 2015. But in 2019, that capability was tested at Georgia Tech. There, police used “HSIN Connect to share live video streams with public safety partners.” A quoted a Georgia Tech police officer about the use of real-time video surveillance on game days, both from stationary cameras and cell phones.“The mobile app for HSIN Connect also allows officials to provide multiple, simultaneous live video streams back to our Operations Center across a secure platform,” the department said.Ohio State told FOIAball that it no longer uses HSIN for events or incidents. However, it declined to answer questions about surveilling protesters or football games.Ohio State’s records department said that it did not have any documents relating to the use of HSIN or sharing video feeds with DHS. Georgia Tech’s records office told FOIAball that HSINs had not been used in years and claimed it was “only used as a tool to share screens internally." Its communications team did not respond to a request to clarify that comment.Years later, DHS had eyes both on the ground and in the sky at college football. According to the 2023 annual review, HSIN Connect operated during University of Central Florida home games that season. There, both security camera and drone detection system feeds were looped into the platform in real-time.DHS that the "success at UCF's football games hints at a broader application in emergency management.” HSIN has in recent years been hooked into facial recognition systems.A 2024 from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that the U.S. Marshals were granted access to HSIN, where they requested "indirect facial recognition searches through state and local entities" using Clearview AI. Which brings us to the Egg Bowl—the annual rivalry game between Ole Miss and Mississippi State. FOIAball learned about the presence of HSIN at Ole Miss through a records request to the city’s police department. It shared Event Action Plans for the Rebels’ games on Nov. 9, 2024 against Georgia and Nov. 30, 2024 against Mississippi State.It’s unclear how these partnerships are forged. In videos discussing HSIN, DHS officials have highlighted their outreach to law enforcement, talking about how they want agencies onboarded and trained on the platform. No schools mentioned in this article answered questions about how their relationship with DHS started.The Event Action Plan provides a fascinating level of detail that shows what goes into security planning for a college football game, from operations meetings that start on Tuesday to safety debriefs the following Monday. Its timeline of events discusses when Ole Miss’s Vaught-Hemingway Stadium is locked down and when security sweeps are conducted. Maps detail where students congregate beforehand and where security guards are posted during games. The document includes contingency plans for extreme heat, lightning, active threats, and protesters. It also includes specific scripts for public service announcers to read in the event of any of those incidents. It shows at least 11 different law enforcement agencies are on the ground on game days, from school cops to state police.They even have the U.S. military on call. The 47th Civil Support Team, based out of Jackson Air National Guard Base, is ready to respond to a chemical, biological, or nuclear attack. All those agencies are steered via the document to the HSIN platform. Under a section on communications, it lists the HSIN Sitroom, which is “Available to all partners and stakeholders via computer & cell phone.”The document includes a link to an HSIN Connect page.It uses Eli Manning as an example of how to log in. “Ole Miss Emergency Management - Log in as a Guest and use a conventional naming convention such as: ‘Eli Manning - Athletics.’”On the document, it notes that the HSIN hosts sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Threat Analysis Documents. “Access is granted on a need-to-know basis, users will need to be approved prior to entry into the SitRoom.”“The general public and general University Community is not permitted to enter the online SitRoom,” it adds. “All SitRooms contain operationally sensitive information and PII, therefore access must be granted by the ‘Host’.”It details what can be accessed in the HSIN, such as a chat window for relaying information.It includes a section on Threat Analysis, which DHS says is conducted through large-scale media monitoring.The document does not detail whether the HSIN used at Ole Miss has access to surveillance cameras across campus. But that may not be something explicitly stated in documents such as these. Like Ohio State, UCF told FOIAball that it had no memoranda of understanding or documentation about providing access to video feeds to HSINs, despite DHS acknowledging those streams were shared. Ole Miss’ records department also did not provide any documents on what campus cameras may have been shared with DHS. While one might assume the feeds go dark after the game is over, there exists the very real possibility that by being tapped in once, DHS can easily access them again. “I’m worried about mission creep,” Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told FOIAball. “These arrangements are made for very specific purposes. But they could become the apparatus of much greater state surveillance.” For Ole Miss, its game against Georgia went off without any major incidents. In the EAP, there was no announcer script for handling a live animal interruption.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You&apos;re More Stressed Than Ever - Let&apos;s Change That</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo1A45ShcMo</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Mo1A45ShcMo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Our brand-new Health Journal is here to help you take care of your physical and mental health, using real science and no guilt: https://shop.kgs.link/healthclub

Stress is a biological superpower that helped your ancestors outrun predators, fight off enemies, and survive extreme situations. In the past, it helped us survive, but today, it’s quietly damaging millions of lives.
What exactly is stress, how did it evolve, and is it even possible to use it in a healthy way?

During that time, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel have shot a religious leader , repeatedly violated court orders limiting the use of force, and even entered a daycare facility to detain someone.Do you know anything else about this? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.One of the main attractions of 3D printers is that they squarely put the means of production into the hands of essentially anyone who is able to buy or access a printer. There’s no need to set up a complex supply chain of material providers or manufacturers. No worry about a store refusing to sell you an item for whatever reason. Instead, users just print at home, and can do so very quickly, sometimes in a matter of minutes. The price of printers has decreased dramatically over the last 10 years, with some costing a few hundred dollars.People who are printing whistles in Chicago either create their own design or are given or download a design someone else made. Resident Justin Schuh made his own. That design includes instructions on how to best use the whistle—three short blasts to signal ICE is nearby, and three long ones for a “code red.” The whistle also includes the phone number for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights (ICIRR) hotline, which people can call to connect with an immigration attorney or receive other assistance. Schuh said he didn’t know if anyone else had printed his design specifically, but he said he has “designed and printed some different variations, when someone local has asked for something specific to their group.” The Printables page for Schuh’s design says it has been downloaded nearly two dozen times.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real-World Java • Victor Grazi, Jeanne Boyarsky &amp; Barry Burd</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6kzMoknPs</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jE6kzMoknPs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:29:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club.

DESCRIPTION
Barry interviews Victor and Jeanne  about their book "Real-World Java: Helping You Navigate the Java Ecosystem".
Victor emphasizes that knowing how to use your development tools, particularly IDE refactoring features, is a better indicator of developer experience than algorithm tests.
Rather than just teaching "hello world" examples, the authors focus on the essential ecosystem components needed to succeed in enterprise Java environments, making it accessible for anyone who knows the Java language but needs to understand the broader technological landscape they'll encounter in professional development roles.

That sound is often known as tinnitus, and sometimes, it doesn’t go away. 

Tinnitus isn’t always detected in a hearing test. Recent studies have shown that it might be a problem called hidden hearing loss. We’re still learning a lot about how our brains process sound, which is why we went deep into this topic with a four-part series called “The Sound Barrier” over on the Unexplainable Podcast. #tinnitus #ears #hearing #hearingloss

The increasingly common method, which many potential targets have yet to learn of, is quick, bypasses most endpoint protections, and works against both macOS and Windows users.ClickFix often starts with an email sent from a hotel that the target has a pending registration with and references the correct registration information. In other cases, ClickFix attacks begin with a WhatsApp message. In still other cases, the user receives the URL at the top of Google results for a search query. Once the mark accesses the malicious site referenced, it presents a CAPTCHA challenge or other pretext requiring user confirmation. The user receives an instruction to copy a string of text, open a terminal window, paste it in, and press Enter.Once entered, the string of text causes the PC or Mac to surreptitiously visit a scammer-controlled server and download malware. Then, the machine automatically installs it—all with no indication to the target. With that, users are infected, usually with credential-stealing malware. Security firms say ClickFix campaigns have run rampant. The lack of awareness of the technique, combined with the links also coming from known addresses or in search results, and the ability to bypass some endpoint protections are all factors driving the growth.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Somalia.

New research from AI startup Goodfire.ai provides the first potentially clear evidence that these different functions actually work through completely separate neural pathways in the model’s architecture.The researchers discovered that this separation proves remarkably clean. In a preprint paper released in late October, they described that when they removed the memorization pathways, models lost 97 percent of their ability to recite training data verbatim but kept nearly all their “logical reasoning” ability intact.For example, at layer 22 in Allen Institute for AI’s OLMo-7B language model, the researchers ranked all the weight components (the mathematical values that process information) from high to low based on a measure called “curvature” (which we’ll explain more below). When they examined these ranked components, the bottom 50 percent of weight components showed 23 percent higher activation on memorized data, while the top 10 percent showed 26 percent higher activation on general, non-memorized text.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using an Astrolabe to Navigate</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R2Vt56_Bj_E</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/R2Vt56_Bj_E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered what it’s like to navigate the Mediterranean using an ancient astrolabe?

The question for victorious allies was how to ensure that justice was seen to be done. Decision was made that was unique in history. There would be an international trial convened in the German city of Nuremberg. The senior Nazis men like Hermann Goering, would be placed in the dock. And the trial that followed would change the course of history.

Packed with documents, witness testimonies, and visual materials from IWM’s collections, the book helps reveal the significance and complexities of the trials that sought to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.

Spain is in the grip of a massive housing crisis and unauthorized settling sharply on the rise. Ángela Mendoza has found an unconventional way to return apartments back to the their owners.

Mendoza used to be a flamenco dancer, but the pandemic and personal setbacks forced her to start over. She hired a group of strong young men and launched her own security firm. Its specialty: Removing squatters and non-paying tenants from apartments all across Spain.

Ángela and her team have already returned hundreds of properties to their owners. She's developed her own psychological approach — a mix of firm pressure and empathetic negotiation.

Business is booming. Last year alone, Spain recorded nearly 20,000 illegal occupations, and the number keeps climbing. Courts are overwhelmed, and obtaining an official eviction order can take years. But Mendoza's work is divisive. Critics accuse her of serving the interests of wealthy investors and landlords at a time when many people in Spain are unable to secure housing for reasons beyond their control.

We’re planning our latest FOIA Forum, a live, hour-long or more interactive session where Joseph and Jason will teach you how to pry records from government agencies through public records requests. We’re planning this for Wednesday, November 19th at 1 PM Eastern. That's in just over a week away! Add it to your calendar! This time we're focused on our coverage of Flock, the automatic license plate reader (ALPR) and surveillance tech company. Earlier this year anonymous researchers had the great idea of asking agencies for the network audit which shows cops were using these cameras. Following that, we did a bunch of coverage, including showing that local police were performing lookups for ICE in Flock's nationwide network of cameras, and that a cop in Texas searched the country for a woman who self-administered an abortion. We'll tell you how all of this came about, what other requests people did after, and what requests we're exploring at the moment with Flock.If this will be your first FOIA Forum, don’t worry, we will do a quick primer on how to file requests (although if you do want to watch our previous FOIA Forums, the video archive is here). We really love talking directly to our community about something we are obsessed with (getting documents from governments) and showing other people how to do it too.Paid subscribers can already find the link to join the livestream below. We'll also send out a reminder a day or so before. Not a subscriber yet? Sign up now here in time to join.We've got a bunch of FOIAs that we need to file and are keen to hear from you all on what you want to see more of. Most of all, we want to teach you how to make your own too. Please consider coming along!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arm Homelab-in-a-Box – Minisforum MS-R1</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXfd0rOOtkg</link><author>Jeff Geerling</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WXfd0rOOtkg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg">Jeff Geerling</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Minisforum just launched the MS-R1, their first Arm workstation PC.

What’s the relationship, if there is a relationship, between God and evolution? ‘Theistic evolution’ is the claim that while evolution is real, God makes critical interventions. But could God not have created the laws of nature so precisely that evolution would not need intervention? Of course, if there is no God, the discussion is moot.

An executive order issued earlier this year put the history and educational aspects of the parks system under threat–but a group of librarians stepped in to save it. This week we have a conversation between Sam and two of the leaders of the independent volunteer archiving project Save Our Signs, an effort to archive national park signs and monument placards. It’s a community collaboration project co-founded by a group of librarians, public historians, and data experts in partnership with the Data Rescue Project and Safeguarding Research & Culture. Lynda Kellam leads the Research Data and Digital Scholarship team at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries and is a founding organizer of the Data Rescue Project. Jenny McBurney is the Government Publications Librarian and Regional Depository Coordinator at the University of Minnesota Libraries. In this episode, they discuss turning “frustration, dismay and disbelief” at parks history under threat into action: compiling more than 10,000 images from over 300 national parks into a database to be preserved for the people.Become a paid subscriber for early access to these interview episodes and to power our journalism.

So when I think about the jobs the data center will bring to our area, I think about the impact of introducing nuclear technology to the world and deploying it on civilians. And the impact that that had on my family, the impact on the health and well-being of my family from living next to a nuclear test site and the spiritual impact that it had on my family for generations. This project is furthering inhumanity, this project is furthering destruction, and we don’t need more nuclear weapons built by our citizens.”At the Ypsilanti city council meeting where Pedri spoke, the town voted to officially fight against the construction of the data center. The University of Michigan says the project is not a data center, but a “high-performance computing facility” and it promises it won’t be used to “manufacture nuclear weapons.” The distinction and assertion are ringing hollow for Ypsilanti residents who oppose construction of the data center, have questions about what it would mean for the environment and the power grid, and want to know why a nuclear weapons lab 24 hours away by car wants to build an AI facility in their small town.“What I think galls me the most is that this major institution in our community, which has done numerous wonderful things, is making decisions with—as I can tell—no consideration for its host community and no consideration for its neighboring jurisdictions,” Ypsilanti councilman Patrick McLean said during a recent council meeting. “I think the process of siting this facility stinks.”For others on the council, the fight is more personal.“I’m a Japanese American with strong ties to my family in Japan and the existential threat of nuclear weapons is not lost on me, as my family has been directly impacted,” Amber Fellows, a Ypsilanti city councilmember who led the charge in opposition to the data center, told 404 Media. “The thing that is most troubling about this is that the nuclear weapons that we, as Americans, witnessed 80 years ago are still being proliferated and modernized without question.”It’s a classic David and Goliath story. On one side is Ypsilanti (called Ypsi by its residents), which has a population just north of 20,000 and situated about 40 minutes outside of Detroit. On the other is the University of Michigan and Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), American scientists famous for nuclear weapons and, lately, pushing the boundaries of AI.The University of Michigan  the Los Alamos data center, what it called an “AI research facility,” last year. According to a press release from the university, the data center will cost $1.25 billion and take up between 220,000 to 240,000 square feet. “The university is currently assessing the viability of locating the facility in Ypsilanti Township,” the .On October 21, the Ypsilanti City Council considered a proposal to officially oppose the data center and the people of the area explained why they wanted it passed. One woman cited environmental and ethical concerns. “Third is the moral problem of having our city resources towards aiding the development of nuclear arms,” she said. “The city of Ypsilanti has a good track record of being on the right side of history and, more often than not, does the right thing. If this resolution passed, it would be a continuation of that tradition.”A man worried about what the facility would do to the physical health of citizens and talked about what happened in other communities where data centers were built. “People have poisoned air and poisoned water and are getting headaches from the generators,” he said. “There’s also reports around the country of energy bills skyrocketing when data centers come in. There’s also reports around the country of local grids becoming much less reliable when the data centers come in…we don’t need to see what it’s like to have a data center in Ypsi. We could just not do that.”The . “The Ypsilanti City Council strongly opposes the Los Alamos-University of Michigan data center due to its connections to nuclear weapons modernization and potential environmental harms and calls for a complete and permanent cessation of all efforts to build this data center in any form,” the resolution said.Ypsi has a lot of reasons to be concerned. Data centers tend to bring , horrible noise, and  to every community they touch. “The fact that U of M is using Ypsilanti as a dumping ground, a sacrifice zone, is unacceptable,” Fellows said.Ypsi’s resolution focused on a different angle though: nuclear weapons. “The Ypsilanti City Council strongly opposes the Los Alamos-University of Michigan data center due to its connections to nuclear weapons modernization and potential environmental harms and calls for a complete and permanent cessation of all efforts to build this data center in any form,” the resolution said.As part of the resolution, Ypsilanti is applying to join the Mayors for Peace initiative, an international organization of cities opposed to nuclear weapons and founded by the former mayor of Hiroshima. Fellows learned about Mayors for Peace when she visited Hiroshima last year.Both LANL and the University of Michigan have been vague about what the data center will be used for, but have said it will include one facility for classified federal research and another for non-classified research which students and faculty will have access to. “Applications include the discovery and design of new materials, calculations on climate preparedness and sustainability,” it  about the data center. “Industries such as mobility, national security, aerospace, life sciences and finance can benefit from advanced modeling and simulation capabilities.”The university FAQ said that the data center will not be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. “Manufacturing” nuclear weapons specifically refers to their creation, something that’s hard to do and only occurs at a handful of specialized facilities across America. I asked both LANL and the University of Michigan if the data generated by the facility would be used in nuclear weapons science in any way. Neither answered the question.“The federal facility is for research and high-performance computing,” the FAQ said. “It will focus on scientific computation to address various national challenges, including cybersecurity, nuclear and other emerging threats, biohazards, and clean energy solutions.”LANL is going all in on AI. It partnered with OpenAI to use the company’s frontier models in research and recently  with NVIDIA to build two new super computers named “Mission” and “Vision.” It’s true that LANL’s scientific output covers a range of issues but its overwhelming focus, , is nuclear weapons. LANL requested a budget of $5.79 billion in 2026. 84 percent of that is earmarked for nuclear weapons. Only $40 million of the LANL budget is set aside for “science,” according to government documents. Do you know anything else about this story? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +1 347 762-9212 or send me an email at matthew@404media.co.“The fact is we don’t really know because Los Alamos and U of M are unwilling to spell out exactly what’s going to happen,” Fellows said. When LANL declined to comment for this story, it told 404 Media to direct its question to the University of Michigan.The university pointed 404 Media to the FAQ page about the project. “You'll see in the FAQs that the locations being considered are not within the city of Ypsilanti,” it said.It’s an odd statement given that this is what’s in the FAQ: “The university is currently assessing the viability of locating the facility in Ypsilanti Township on the north side of Textile Road, directly across the street from the Ford Rawsonville Components plant and adjacent to the LG Energy Solutions plant.”It’s true that this is not technically in the city of Ypsilanti but rather Ypsilanti Township, a collection of communities that almost entirely surrounds the city itself. For Fellows, it’s a distinction without a difference. “[Univeristy of Michigan] can build it in Barton Hills and see how the city of Ann Arbor feels about it,” she said, referencing a village that borders the township where the university's home city of Ann Arbor.“The university has, and will continue to, explore other sites if they are viable in the timeframe needed for successful completion of the project,” Kay Jarvis, the university’s director of public affairs, told 404 Media.Fellows said that Ypsilanti will fight the data center with everything it has. “We’re putting pressure on the Ypsi township board to use whatever tools they have to deny permits…and to stand up for their community,” she said. “We’re also putting pressure on the U of M board of trustees, the county, our state legislature that approved these projects and funded them with public funds. We’re identifying all the different entities that have made this project possible so far and putting pressure on them to reverse action.”For Fellows, the fight is existential. It’s not just about the environmental concerns around the construction project. “I was under the belief that the prevailing consensus was that nuclear weapons are wrong and they should be drawn down as fast as possible. I’m trying to use what little power I have to work towards that goal,” she said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What &apos;Orwellian&apos; really means | The Gray Area</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1UbFyNsTQc</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/X1UbFyNsTQc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We use “Orwellian” to describe everything from campus dust-ups to authoritarian crackdowns.

ORIGINAL TALK TITLE
Containerization ≠ Modernization: Kick-Start Your True Transformation Journey

ABSTRACT
Containers solved a huge deployment headache—but they didn’t magically erase legacy thinking. If your “modernization” effort stopped at lifting-and-shifting monolithic apps into Kubernetes, you’ve simply boxed yesterday’s problems in today’s tech.

In this session we’ll unpack why true modernization demands more than orchestration stickers: it requires re-architecting for event-driven, serverless, and AI-augmented patterns that slash time-to-value and operating costs. Drawing on field experience across 50+ enterprise and startup transformations—spanning 8,000+ AWS Lambda functions, real-time data pipelines, and GenAI copilots.

We’ll explore:
• The Illusion of Progress: Hidden technical debt and cost traps that containers often preserve.
• Transformation Levers: Domain-driven decomposition, serverless services, and managed data layers that free teams from infrastructure toil.
• GenAI as a Catalyst: Where large-language-model capabilities amplify modernization ROI—and where they don’t.
• Change Management Playbook: Culture, skill-matrix, and governance shifts that let teams iterate safely at cloud speed.
• Success Metrics & Case Studies: Concrete KPIs (release frequency ↑ 5×, infra spend ↓ 60%) from healthcare, QSR, and fintech modernizations. [...]

Passchendaele became a byword for the futility, endurance and industrialised slaughter of the First World War.In a battle that lasted from July to November 1917, men, horses and equipment trudged through a swampy moonscape of shell holes in an attempt to crack the German line in Flanders. It became a relentless, attritional push along a low ridge east of Ypres through constant rain, gas attacks and hurricane barrages.Genealogist and specialist researcher for Findmypast, Jen Baldwin, joins Dan to share incredible details about what Passchendeale was really like for the men who were there through the records, newspaper accounts and diaries left by the men in the Findmypast archives.You too can search the incredible records in the Findmypast archive to piece together your own family’s forgotten heroes. To mark Remembrance Day, ​millions of military records are completely free to access and explore from 7th -13th November.

Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.91.1 is as easy as:If you don't have it already, you can get  from the
appropriate page on our website.Rust 1.91.1 includes fixes for two regressions introduced in the 1.91.0 release.
Linker and runtime errors on WasmMost targets supported by Rust identify symbols by their name, but Wasm
identifies them with a symbol name  a Wasm module name. The
#[link(wasm_import_module)] attribute allows to
customize the Wasm module name an  block refers to:Rust 1.91.0 introduced a regression in the attribute, which could cause linker
failures during compilation ( errors) or the wrong
function being used at runtime (leading to undefined behavior, including crashes
and silent data corruption). This happened when the same symbol name was
imported from two different Wasm modules across multiple Rust crates.Rust 1.91.1 fixes the regression. More details are available in issue #148347.
Cargo target directory locking broken on illumosCargo relies on locking the  directory during a build to prevent
concurrent invocations of Cargo from interfering with each other. Not all
filesystems support locking (most notably some networked ones): if the OS
returns the  error when attempting to lock, Cargo assumes locking
is not supported and proceeds without it.Cargo 1.91.0 switched from custom code interacting with the OS APIs to the
 standard library method (recently stabilized in Rust 1.89.0). Due
to an oversight, that method always returned  on the illumos
target, causing Cargo to never lock the build directory on illumos regardless of
whether the filesystem supported it.Rust 1.91.1 fixes the oversight in the standard library by enabling the
 family of functions on illumos, indirectly fixing the Cargo
regression.Many people came together to create Rust 1.91.1. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. Thanks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Peasants, by Władysław Reymont</title><link>https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wladyslaw-reymont/the-peasants/michael-henry-dziewicki</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wladyslaw-reymont/the-peasants/michael-henry-dziewicki/downloads/wladyslaw-reymont_the-peasants_michael-henry-dziewicki.epub?source=feed" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 23:32:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard E-Books</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The native inhabitants of a Polish village deal with family conflicts, squabbles over land, societal unrest, and the changing of the seasons.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Debugging Book • Andreas Zeller &amp; Clare Sudbery</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdLwVt4LCXo</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EdLwVt4LCXo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 22:47:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club.

DESCRIPTION
Programming education has a critical blind spot: while we extensively teach code creation, we barely scratch the surface of testing and give almost no attention to debugging—despite debugging consuming half of all software development time.

In this conversation with Clare Sudbery, Prof. Andreas Zeller argues that systematic debugging skills and modern automated debugging tools are the "ugly stepchild" of programming that nobody wants to discuss, yet debugging represents the biggest business risk and time sink in software development.

In its quest for more information about the species, this report finds tens of thousands of crayfish in just one pool along the upper Rhine River. Can this invasive creature still be stopped?

The last remaining habitats of amphibians and dragonflies are at risk. Calico crayfish are endangering biodiversity along the upper Rhine. These crayfish can strip entire biotopes bare. They've completely destroyed a project to reintroduce marsh turtles costing millions of Euros. We meet a frustrated research team and a fisher who says he can't simply stand by and watch - and who catches and eats as many of the crayfish as possible. But is this really a solution? Should we be using biocides in future as a way to combat invasive species? And how did the American crayfish get to Europe in the first place? 

It's evident that the crayfish can no longer be completely eradicated, but as a research team from Karlsruhe has found, small biotopes can be protected. Although such measures don't come cheap, this offers a glimmer of hope for endangered amphibian species. But what lessons can be learned, and what might our future response to invasive species look like? This documentary shows how much damage a single invasive species can cause.

Materialism is the theory that only the physical is real, such that consciousness must be entirely a product of the brain. Materialism is counting on neuroscience to explain consciousness eventually, though this expectation is challenged because mental states seem so radically distinct from brain states. What are the arguments for and against Materialism (like the ‘hard problem’?).

But can a chatbot really deliver “the whole truth and nothing but the truth” as he says? In this video, we dive into the battle between Wikipedia’s messy, transparent consensus and Grokipedia’s algorithmic certainty.

There are dubious characters, bags of cash, and key witnesses who suddenly die. At its heart is the question: How do you stash away 6 billion marks?

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, with the Cold War over and German reunification on the horizon, lawyer and politician Gregor Gysi inherited a fortune worth billions. Hardly anyone knew about the wealth of East Germany’s ruling party, the SED. Gysi became the revamped party’s new chairman, and little by little, he became aware of how the SED had enriched itself over 40 years of misgoverning. The party assets still belonged to the SED and its successor party, but it was unclear how long that would remain the case. East Germany was undergoing massive changes, with the first free democratic elections imminent. How could this enormous wealth be secured? In December 1989, transactions of incredible proportions started being made. Domestic and foreign currency, as well as other assets, were distributed to old party cadres. There were suitcases and bags full of cash. Loans were handed out to party comrades, sometimes amounting to millions. In later years, international investigators would implicate numerous businesspeople, and even an Islamic religious group. In particular, the Austrian Rudolfine Steindling played a key role in covering up traces of the money in her role as trustee of a company linked to the SED.

Here are the studies this week that took a bite out of life, appealed to the death drive, gave a yellow light to the universe, and produced hitherto unknown levels of cute.First, it’s the most epic ocean battle: orcas versus sharks (pro tip: you don’t want to be sharks). Then, a scientific approach to apocalyptic ideation; curbing cosmic enthusiasm; and last, the wonderful world of tadpole-less toads.I guess that’s why they call them killer whalesOrcas kill young great white sharks by flipping them upside down and tearing their livers out of their bellies, which they then eat family-style, according to a new study that includes new footage of these Promethean interactions in Mexican waters.“Here we document novel repeated predations by killer whales on juvenile white sharks in the Gulf of California,” said researchers led by Jesús Erick Higuera Rivas of the non-profit Pelagic Protection and Conservation AC. “Aerial videos indicate consistency in killer whales’ repeated assaults and strikes on the sharks,” the team added. “Once extirpated from the prey body, the target organ is shared between the members of the pods including calves.”I’ll give you a beat to let that sink in, like orca teeth on the belly of a shark. While it's well-established that orcas are the only known predator of great white sharks aside from humans, the new study is only the second glimpse of killer whales targeting juvenile sharks. This group of orcas, known as Moctezuma’s pod, has developed an effective strategy of working together to flip the sharks over, which interrupts the sharks’ sensory system and puts them into a state called tonic immobility. The authors describe the pod’s work as methodical and well coordinated.“Our evidence undoubtedly shows consistency in the repeated assaults and strikes, indicating efficient maneuvering ability by the killer whales in attempting to turn the shark upside down, likely to induce tonic immobility and allow uninterrupted access to the organs for consumption, " the team said. Previous reports suggest that “the lack of bite marks or injuries anywhere other than the pectoral fins shows a novel and specialized technique of accessing the liver of the shark with minimal handling of each individual.”  An orca attacking a juvenile great white shark. Image: Marco Villegas Sharks, by the way, do not attack orcas. Just the opposite. As you can imagine based on the horrors you have just read, sharks are so petrified of killer whales that they book it whenever they sense a nearby pod.“Adult white sharks exhibit a memory and previous knowledge about killer whales, which enables them to activate an avoidance mechanism through behavioral risk effects; a ‘fear’- induced mass exodus from aggregations sites,” the team said. “This response may preclude repeated successful predation on adult white sharks by killer whales.”In other words, if you’re a shark, one encounter with orcas is enough to make you watch your dorsal side for life—assuming you were lucky enough to escape with it. You may have seen the doomer humor meme to “send the asteroid already,” a plea for sweet cosmic relief that fits our beleaguered times. As it turns out, some scientists engage in this type of apocalyptic wish fulfillment professionally. Planetary defense experts often participate in drills involving fictional hazardous asteroids, such as the 2024PDC25, a virtual object “discovered” at the 2025 Planetary Defense Conference. In that simulation, 2024PDC25 had a possible impact date in 2041.Now a team has used that exercise as a jumping off point to explore what might happen if it hit even earlier, channeling that “send the asteroid already” energy.. The researchers used this time-crunched scenario to speculate about the effect on geopolitics and pivotal events, such as the 2028 US Presidential elections.“As it is very difficult to extrapolate from 2025 across 16 years in this ‘what-if’ exercise, we decided to bring the scenario forward to 2031 and examine it with today’s global background,” Rudolf Albrecht of the Austrian Space Forum. “Today would be T-6 years and the threat is becoming immediate.”As the astro-doomers would say: Finally some good news.First, we discovered the universe was expanding. Then, we discovered it was expanding at an accelerating rate. Now, a new study suggests that this acceleration might be slowing down. Universe, make up your mind!But seriously, the possibility that the rate of cosmic expansion is slowing is a big deal, because dark energy—the term for whatever is making the universe expand—was assumed to be a constant for decades. But this consensus has been challenged by observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in Arizona, which became operational in 2021. In its first surveys, DESI’s observations have pointed to an expansion rate that is not fixed, but in flux.Together with past results, the study “suggests that dark energy may no longer be a cosmological constant” and “our analysis raises the possibility that the present universe is no longer in a state of accelerated expansion,” said researchers led by Junhyuk Son of Yonsei University. “This provides a fundamentally new perspective that challenges the two central pillars of the [cold dark matter] standard cosmological model proposed 27 years ago.”It will take more research to constrain this mystery, but for now it’s a reminder that the universe loves to surprise.And the award for most squee goes to…We’ll end, as all things should, with toadlets. Most frogs and toads reproduce by laying eggs that hatch into tadpoles, but scientists have discovered three new species of toad in Tanzania that give birth to live young—a very rare adaptation for any amphibian, known as ovoviviparity. The scientific term for these youngsters is in fact “toadlet.” Gods be good.“We describe three new species from the Nectophrynoides viviparus species complex, covering the southern Eastern Arc Mountains populations,” said researchers led by Christian Thrane of the University of Copenhagen. One of the new species included “the observation of toadlets, suggesting that this species is ovoviviparous.”Note to Nintendo: please make a very tiny Toadlet into a Mario Kart racer.Thanks for reading! See you next week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>30 seconds of baby burrowing owlets 😍 #Owls #AmericasNationalParks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/insXoV0T0lM</link><author>Nat Geo Animals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/insXoV0T0lM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 16:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPk9MG2RexnOMGTD-YnSnA">Nat Geo Animals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[These baby owlets learn everything from pouncing to flying in the first six weeks of their lives.

In 1939, Germany plunges Europe into war by breaking their promises for peace and marching into Poland. By the end of 1940 though, Britain is the only Great Power still standing against a seemingly invincible German juggernaut.

After six prime ministers – including currently serving Keir Starmer – the country still struggles with the aftermath. Many voters now regret their decision to leave the EU and accuse pro-Brexit advocates like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage of misleading them during the campaign. 

What do you think? Was Brexit worth it?

Bush administration over the power of the presidency and the rule of law. 

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

For three decades, Dick Cheney had been an advocate of granting the president virtually unlimited wartime power. In the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, with Cheney as George W. Bush’s vice president, the Justice Department and the White House made a number of controversial legal decisions. Orchestrated by Cheney and his lawyer David Addington, the department interpreted executive power in an expansive and extraordinary way, granting Bush the power to detain, interrogate, torture, wiretap and spy — without congressional approval or judicial review.

In “Cheney’s Law,” a documentary by Michael Kirk and his team, FRONTLINE examined the battle over the power of the presidency and Cheney’s way of looking at the Constitution. As the White House and Congress faced off over executive privilege, the terrorist surveillance program, and the firing of U.S. attorneys, FRONTLINE told the story of what formed Cheney’s perspectives and what some at the time viewed as the most ambitious project to reshape the power of the president in American history.

It could be an AI model trying (and failing) to blend in with the crowd.On Wednesday, researchers from the University of Zurich, University of Amsterdam, Duke University, and New York University released a study revealing that AI models remain easily distinguishable from humans in social media conversations, with overly friendly emotional tone serving as the most persistent giveaway. The research, which tested nine open-weight models across Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Reddit, found that classifiers developed by the researchers detected AI-generated replies with 70 to 80 percent accuracy.The study introduces what the authors call a “computational Turing test” to assess how closely AI models approximate human language.

In 2023 alone, 26 million hectares of forest were burned. Scientists and indigenous communities are both searching for ways to stop the destruction.

In many parts of the world, fires were once a natural phenomenon. Periodic fires rejuvenated forests, made plains fertile, and helped biodiversity to flourish. Today, however, extreme fires are becoming rapidly more prevalent - killing both humans and animals and destroying nature on an unprecedented scale.

This documentary follows the collaboration between scientists and indigenous guardians who are fighting to protect forests and other ecosystems. It explores the benefits of traditional farming techniques, exposes prejudice and corruption, and highlights the deep-rooted knowledge that indigenous communities have when it comes to protecting our planet.

Their stories can inspire us to see the natural world not as a resource, but as the very foundation of life.

This week, we discuss archiving to get around paywalls, hating on smart glasses, and more.I was going to try to twist myself into knots attempting to explain the throughline between my articles this week, and about how I’ve been thinking about the news and our coverage more broadly. This was going to be something about trying to promote analog media and distinctly human ways of communicating (like film photography), while highlighting the very bad economic and political incentives pushing us toward fundamentally dehumanizing, anti-human methods of communicating. Like fully automated, highly customized and targeted AI ads, automated library software, and I guess whatever Nancy Pelosi has been doing with her stock portfolio. But then I remembered that I blogged about the FBI’s subpoena against archive.is, a website I feel very ambivalent about and one that is the subject of perhaps my most cringe blog of all time.So let’s revisit that cringe blog, which was called “Dear GamerGate: Please Stop Stealing Our Shit.” I wrote this article in 2014, which was fully 11 years ago, which is alarming to me. First things first: They were not stealing from me they were stealing from VICE, a company that I did not actually experience financial gains from related to people reading articles; it was good if people read my articles and traffic was very important, and getting traffic over time led to me getting raises and promotions and stuff, but the company made very, very clear that we did not “own” the articles and therefore they were not “mine” in the way that they are now. With that out of the way, the reporting and general reason for the article was I think good but the tone of it is kind of wildly off, and, as I mentioned, over the course of many years I have now come to regard archive.is as sort of an integral archiving tool. If you are unfamiliar with archive.is, it’s a site that takes snapshots of any URL and creates a new link for them which, notably, does not go to the original website. Archive.is is extremely well known for bypassing the paywalls on many sites, 404 Media sometimes but not usually among them. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stephen Wolfram on Quantum Mechanics | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDjW5ZDKUho</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xDjW5ZDKUho?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 16:01:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Make a donation to help Closer To Truth continue exploring the world's deepest questions without the need for paywalls: https://closertotruth.com/donate/

After a decade-long excavation at a remote site in Kenya, scientists have unearthed evidence that our early human relatives continuously fashioned the same tools across thousands of generations, hinting that sophisticated tool use may have originated much earlier than previously known,  in .The discovery of nearly 1,300 artifacts—with ages that span 2.44 to 2.75 million years old—reveals that the influential Oldowan tool-making tradition existed across at least 300,000 years of turbulent environmental shifts. The wealth of new tools from Kenya’s Namorotukunan site suggest that their makers adapted to major environmental changes in part by passing technological knowledge down through the ages.“The question was: did they generally just reinvent the [Oldowan tradition] over and over again? That made a lot of sense when you had a record that was kind of sporadic,” said David R. Braun, a professor of anthropology at the George Washington University who led the study, in a call with 404 Media. “But the fact that we see so much similarity between 2.4 and 2.75 [million years ago] suggests that this is generally something that they do,” he continued. “Some of it may be passed down through social learning, like observation of others doing it. There’s some kind of tradition that continues on for this timeframe that would argue against this idea of just constantly reinventing the wheel.”Oldowan tools, which date back at least 2.75 million years, are distinct from earlier traditions in part because hominins, the broader family to which humans belong, specifically sought out high-quality materials such as chert and quartz to craft sharp-edged cutting and digging tools. This advancement allowed them to butcher large animals, like hippos, and possibly dig for underground food sources.When Braun and his colleagues began excavating at Namorotukunan in 2013, they found many artifacts made of chalcedony, a fine-grained rock that is typically associated with much later tool-making traditions. To the team’s surprise, the rocks were dated to periods as early as 2.75 million years ago, making them among the oldest artifacts in the Oldowan record. “Even though Oldowan technology is really just hitting one rock against the other, there's good and bad ways of doing it,” Braun explained. “So even though it's pretty simple, what they seem to be figuring out is where to hit the rock, and which angles to select. They seem to be getting a grip on that—not as well as later in time—but they're definitely getting an understanding at this timeframe.”The excavation was difficult as it takes several days just to reach the remote offroad site, while much of the work involved tiptoing along steep outcrops. Braun joked that their auto mechanic lined up all the vehicle shocks that had been broken during the drive each season, as a testament to the challenge. But by the time the project finally concluded in 2022, the researchers had established that Oldowan tools were made at this site over the course of 300,000 years. During this span, the landscape of Namorotukunan shifted from lush humid forests to arid desert shrubland and back again. Despite these destabilizing shifts in their climate and biome, the hominins that made these tools endured in part because this technology opened up new food sources to them, such as the carcasses of large animals. “The whole landscape really shifts,” Braun said. “But hominins are able to basically ameliorate those rapid changes in the amount of rainfall and the vegetation around by using tools to adapt to what’s happening.”“That's a human superpower—it’s that ability we have to keep this information stored in our collective heads, so that when new challenges show up, there's somebody in our group that remembers how to deal with this particular adaptation,” he added.It’s not clear exactly which species of hominin made the tools at Namorotukunan; it may have been early members of our own genus , or other relatives, like Australopithecus afarensis, that later went extinct. Regardless, the discovery of such a long-lived and continuous assemblage may hint that the origins of these tools are much older than we currently know.“I think that we're going to start to find tool use much earlier” perhaps “going back five, six, or seven million years,” Braun said. “That’s total speculation. I've got no evidence that that's the case. But judging from what primates do, I don't really understand why we wouldn't see it.” To that end, the researchers plan to continue excavating these bygone landscapes to search for more artifacts and hominin remains that could shed light on the identity of these tool makers, probing the origins of these early technologies that eventually led to humanity’s dominance on the planet.“It's possible that this tool use is so diverse and so different from our expectations that we have blinders on,” Braun concluded. “We have to open our search for what tool use looks like, and then we might start to see that they're actually doing a lot more of it than we thought they were.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Social Diaries with Evan Spiegel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yO1IqkjhXGo</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yO1IqkjhXGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 14:07:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Emily Chang heads to the Venice boardwalk to spend a day with Snap Co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel.

Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show — a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time. 

It’s a pretty special week for guests over here in Take town. We’re welcoming debut filmmaker Ronan Day-Lewis, and his dad who’s come with him and is apparently quite famous or something? Yes, that’s Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, star and co-writer of ‘Anemone’—the father-son co-created drama that has brought him out of retirement. Day-Lewis stars as reclusive and damaged former soldier Ray, who reconnects with his brother Jem (Sean Bean) after years in the wilderness. The pair unpack the film with Simon—including how a 16th Century manuscript partially inspired it, their family history in Ireland, and what it was like to write and shoot an intense father-son story as a real life father-son team. 

Mark reviews it too, along with three more big movies you can head down to the cinema to watch this weekend—code compliantly, obvs. First up, ‘Predator: Badlands’—the latest instalment in this very loooong running sci-fi action franchise which the classic villain turns hero and the hunter turns hunted. In calmer territory, we’ve got ‘The Choral’ too—a cosy drama about a Yorkshire village choir during WWI, led by controversial new conductor Dr. Henry Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes). And finally, the new and long-awaited Lynne Ramsay film ‘Die My Love’—a dark family drama starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. Reckon Mark’s going to be excited about this one...  

All the usual email excellence, bantz, rantz, and everything you’ve come to expect from a top Take too.

As a young girl she was used as a dynastic pawn by her father and sent to Germany to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. Here she was crowned empress and trained to rule.When her younger brother died, followed by her husband, Matilda returned to England to take her place as her father’s heir. But after her father’s death she was beaten to the throne by her cousin Stephen, and so began the medieval civil war known as the Anarchy. Although Matilda ultimately lost, her son, Henry, was made Stephen’s heir, and he went on to rule with support and advice from his royal mother. So who was the real winner?This episode traces Matilda’s dramatic life from daughter of a king to empress of Germany to queen-in-waiting of England. Along the way, we ask whether medieval sexism prevented her from taking the throne, and look at the ways a woman could rule in twelfth-century Europe.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

If you enjoyed the video, please help feed the algorithm by liking and commenting. This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you! Two brothers. One throne. A decision that changed the course of British history forever. This is the story of King George VI and King Edward VIII - two men whose contrasting choices during the 1936 abdication crisis would define their legacies and shape the future of the British monarchy through World War II and beyond.

Edward VIII chose love over duty, abdicating the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson in what became the most controversial royal scandal of the 20th century. His younger brother, the reluctant George VI, stepped forward to shoulder the burden of kingship during Britain's darkest hour, overcoming personal struggles to become a symbol of courage and resilience during the Second World War.

But the story doesn't end there. While George VI led his nation through war and earned the admiration of millions, Edward's actions during and after the abdication raised questions about his loyalty, his judgment, and his true character. Was he simply a man who followed his heart, or was there something darker beneath the surface?

This documentary explores the lives, decisions, and legacies of both brothers - examining how their choices shaped not only their own destinies but the fate of an entire nation.

Pelosi’s trades over the years, many done through her husband and investing partner Paul Pelosi, have been so good that an entire startup, called , was started to allow investors to directly mirror Pelosi’s portfolio. According to the site, more than 3 million people have invested more than $1 billion using the app. After 38 years, Pelosi will retire from the league—a somewhat normal career length as investors, especially on Pelosi’s team, have decided to stretch their careers later and later into their lives. The numbers put up by Pelosi in her Hall of Fame career are undeniable. Over the last decade, Pelosi’s portfolio returned an incredible 816 percent, according to public disclosure records. , meanwhile, has returned roughly 229 percent. Awe-inspired fans and analysts theorized that her almost omniscient ability to make correct, seemingly high-risk stock decisions may have stemmed from decades spent analyzing and perhaps even predicting decisions that would be made by the federal government that could impact companies’ stock prices. For example, Paul Pelosi sold $500,000 worth of Visa stock in July, weeks before the U.S. government announced a civil lawsuit against the company, causing its stock price to decrease.  Besides Autopilot and numerous Pelosi stock trade trackers, there have also been several exchange traded funds (ETFs) set up that allow investors to directly copy their portfolio on Pelosi and her trades. Related funds, such as The Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (NANC, for Nancy), set up by the Unusual Whales investment news Twitter account, seek to allow investors to diversify their portfolios by tracking the trades of not just Pelosi but also some of her colleagues, including those on the other team, who have also proven to be highly gifted stock traders.Fans of Pelosi spent much of Thursday admiring her career, and wondering what comes next: “Farewell to one of the greatest investors of all time,” the top post on Reddit’s Wall Street Bets community reads. The sentiment has more than 24,000 upvotes at the time of publication. Fans will spend years debating in bars whether Pelosi was the GOAT; some investors have noted that in recent years, some of her contemporaries, like Marjorie Taylor-Green, Ro Khanna, and Michael McCaul, have put up gaudier numbers. There are others who say the league needs reformation, with some of Pelosi’s colleagues saying they should stop playing at all, and many fans agreeing with that sentiment. Despite the controversy,  have committed to continue playing the game.Pelosi said Thursday that this season would be her last, but like other legends who have gone out on top, it seems she is giving it her all until the end. Just weeks ago, she sold between $100,000 and $250,000 of Apple stock, according to a public box score.“We can be proud of what we have accomplished,” Pelosi  announcing her retirement. “But there’s always much more work to be done.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everything is Gambling Now</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7uCUi5Bv6k</link><author>Ordinary Things</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/r7uCUi5Bv6k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 20:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxLYtICsUCWdr1YPrj5DtwA">Ordinary Things</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to restore the planet’s ecosystems and see your impact in monthly videos?

On industry standard benchmarks with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, TabPFN-2.5 substantially outperforms tuned tree-based models and matches the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2.For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications andmethods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.This new release will substantially strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on TabPFN.Tabular data is ubiquitous, forming the backbone of decision-making in countless domains, from finance to healthcare. For decades, traditional tabular machine learning—built on gradient-boosted trees, random forests, and linear or additive models—has been the workhorse of applied data science. Yet these methods remain limited: they require extensive dataset-specific tuning, often provide uncalibrated or unreliable uncertainty estimates without significant modification, and lack the generalization and transferability of modern foundation models.Tabular foundation models (TFMs) offer a new paradigm. They address these limitations by pretraining on large synthetic distributions of tabular tasks and performing inference via in-context learning instead of gradient descent. They are training-free predictors meta-trained to yield strong calibration, without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive hyperparameter tuning necessary for gradient-boosted trees. Their strong generalization makes them particularly attractive for data-scarce domains.Our initial release, TabPFNv1, served as a proof-of-concept that a transformer could learn a Bayesian-like inference algorithm, though it was limited to small (up to 1,000 samples), clean, numerical-only data. Our successor, TabPFNv2, scaled this idea into a practical model for datasets up to 10,000 samples. TabPFNv2 handles the messy and heterogeneous data seen in the real world—including categorical features, missing values & outliers.State-of-the-Art PerformanceIn a forward pass, TabPFN-2.5 outperforms tuned tree-based models (like XGBoost and CatBoost) and matches the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4 tuned for 4 hours—a complex ensemble that includes all previous methods, even TabPFNv2.We scale the power of in-context learning to datasets of up to 50,000 samples (5× increase over TabPFNv2) and 2,000 features (4× increase), making TFMs viable for a much wider range of real-world problems.We've dramatically improved inference latency. Our proprietary distillation engine converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This new JS framework wants you to quit React…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIj9UWpvSFI</link><author>Fireship</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IIj9UWpvSFI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 18:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Test drive the Kiro AI IDE for free - https://fandf.co/3IG1vCK

It was a turbulent time: the city's crime rate was high, and there were mass protests in response to the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans.

Scott, a reformer and idealist, grew up in Baltimore at a time when the city was marked by crime and urban decay. He had lost friends to gun violence and knew first-hand what life on the streets was like. As mayor, he and his team aimed to reduce the crime rate. His guiding principle was that, in a city overwhelmed by violence, peace is the only thing worth fighting for.

In contrast to previous city governments, Scott focused more on prevention than on controlling crime and making arrests. He wanted to give people alternatives, opportunities and hope. But as soon as he took office he was confronted by a new wave of violence. Before he could implement his reforms, he was already under pressure. The media and political opponents attacked his "woke" policies, and the Maryland governor refused to talk to the new mayor for months - despite being responsible for funding city programs.

This documentary follows Brandon Scott and his team through their first year in City Hall. It shows the struggle of a man who is determined to stick to his convictions, despite resistance, setbacks and political isolation. Can his holistic approach help Baltimore heal? Could it even become a blueprint for other cities in the US?

The Kubernetes SIG Network community presented the General Availability (GA) release of Gateway API (v1.4.0)! Released on October 6, 2025, version 1.4.0 reinforces the path for modern, expressive, and extensible service networking in Kubernetes.Gateway API v1.4.0 brings three new features to the 
(Gateway API's GA release channel):BackendTLSPolicy for TLS between gateways and backends in GatewayClass statusand introduces three new experimental features:Mesh resource for service mesh configuration to ease configuration burden** filter for HTTPRouteGraduations to Standard ChannelBackendTLSPolicy is a new Gateway API type for specifying the TLS configuration
of the connection from the Gateway to backend pod(s).
. Prior to the introduction of BackendTLSPolicy, there was no API specification
that allowed encrypted traffic on the hop from Gateway to backend.The  configuration requires a hostname. This 
serves two purposes. It is used as the SNI header when connecting to the backend and
for authentication, the certificate presented by the backend must match this hostname,
 is explicitly specified.If  (SANs) are specified, the  is only used for SNI, and authentication is performed against the SANs instead. If you still need to authenticate against the hostname value in this case, you MUST add it to the  list.BackendTLSPolicy  configuration also requires either  or .
 refer to one or more (up to 8) PEM-encoded TLS certificate bundles. If there are no specific certificates to use,
then depending on your implementation, you may use ,
set to "System" to tell the Gateway to use an implementation-specific set of trusted CA Certificates.In this example, the BackendTLSPolicy is configured to use certificates defined in the auth-cert ConfigMap
to connect with a TLS-encrypted upstream connection where pods backing the auth service are expected to serve a
valid certificate for . It uses  with a Hostname type, but you may also use a URI type.In this example, the BackendTLSPolicy is configured to use system certificates to connect with a TLS-encrypted backend connection where Pods backing the dev Service are expected to serve a valid certificate for .GatewayClass status has a new field, .
This addition allows implementations to declare the set of features they support. This provides a clear way for users and tools to understand the capabilities of a given GatewayClass.This feature's name for conformance tests (and GatewayClass status reporting) is .
Implementations must populate the  field in the  of the GatewayClass  the GatewayClass
is accepted, or in the same operation.Here’s an example of a  published under GatewayClass' :Graduation of SupportedFeatures to Standard, helped improve the conformance testing process for Gateway API.
The conformance test suite will now automatically run tests based on the features populated in the GatewayClass' status.
This creates a strong, verifiable link between an implementation's declared capabilities and the test results,
making it easier for implementers to run the correct conformance tests and for users to trust the conformance reports.This means when the SupportedFeatures field is populated in the GatewayClass status there will be no need for additional
conformance tests flags like , or  or .
It's important to note that Mesh features are an exception to this and can be tested for conformance by using
, or by manually providing any combination of features related flags until the dedicated resource
graduates from the experimental channel.This enhancement enables route rules to be explicitly identified and referenced across the Gateway API ecosystem.
Some of the key use cases include: Allowing status conditions to reference specific rules directly by name. Making it easier to identify individual rules in logs, traces, and metrics. Enabling policies (GEP-713) to target specific route rules via the  field in their . Simplifying filtering and referencing of route rules in tools such as , , and general-purpose utilities like  and .Internal configuration mapping: Facilitating the generation of internal configurations that reference route rules by name within gateway and mesh implementations.This follows the same well-established pattern already adopted for Gateway listeners, Service ports, Pods (and containers),
and many other Kubernetes resources.While the new name field is  (so existing resources remain valid), its use is .
Implementations are not expected to assign a default value, but they may enforce constraints such as immutability.Finally, keep in mind that the name format is validated,
and other fields (such as )
may impose additional, indirect constraints.Experimental channel changesEnabling external Auth for HTTPRouteGiving Gateway API the ability to enforce authentication and maybe authorization as well at the Gateway or HTTPRoute level has been a highly requested feature for a long time. (See the GEP-1494 issue for some background.)This Gateway API release adds an Experimental filter in HTTPRoute that tells the Gateway API implementation to call out to an external service to authenticate (and, optionally, authorize) requests.This filter is based on the Envoy ext_authz API, and allows talking to an Auth service that uses either gRPC or HTTP for its protocol.Both methods allow the configuration of what headers to forward to the Auth service, with the HTTP protocol allowing some extra information like a prefix path.A HTTP example might look like this (noting that this example requires the Experimental channel to be installed and an implementation that supports External Auth to actually understand the config):This allows the backend Auth service to use the supplied headers to make a determination about the authentication for the request.When a request is allowed, the external Auth service will respond with a 200 HTTP response code, and optionally extra headers to be included in the request that is forwarded to the backend. When the request is denied, the Auth service will respond with a 403 HTTP response.Since the Authorization header is used in many authentication methods, this method can be used to do Basic, Oauth, JWT, and other common authentication and authorization methods.Gateway API v1.4.0 introduces a new experimental Mesh resource, which provides a way to configure mesh-wide settings and discover the features supported by a given mesh implementation. This resource is analogous to the Gateway resource and will initially be mainly used for conformance testing, with plans to extend its use to off-cluster Gateways in the future.The Mesh resource is cluster-scoped and, as an experimental feature, is named  and resides in the gateway.networking.x-k8s.io API group. A key field is controllerName, which specifies the mesh implementation responsible for the resource. The resource's  stanza indicates whether the mesh implementation has accepted it and lists the features the mesh supports.One of the goals of this GEP is to avoid making it more difficult for users to adopt a mesh. To simplify adoption, mesh implementations are expected to create a default Mesh resource upon startup if one with a matching  doesn't already exist. This avoids the need for manual creation of the resource to begin using a mesh.The new XMesh API kind, within the gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group,
provides a central point for mesh configuration and feature discovery (source).A minimal XMesh object specifies the :The mesh implementation populates the status field to confirm it has accepted the resource and to list its supported features ( source):Introducing default GatewaysFor application developers, one common piece of feedback has been the need to explicitly name a parent Gateway for every single north-south Route. While this explicitness prevents ambiguity, it adds friction, especially for developers who just want to expose their application to the outside world without worrying about the underlying infrastructure's naming scheme. To address this, we have introduce the concept of .For application developers: Just "use the default"As an application developer, you often don't care about the specific Gateway your traffic flows through, you just want it to work. With this enhancement, you can now create a Route and simply ask it to use a default Gateway.This is done by setting the new  field in your Route's .Here’s a simple  that uses a default Gateway:That's it! No more need to hunt down the correct Gateway name for your environment. Your Route is now a "defaulted Route."For cluster operators: You're still in controlThis feature doesn't take control away from cluster operators ("Chihiro").
In fact, they have explicit control over which Gateways can act as a default. A Gateway will only accept these  if it is configured to do so.You can also use a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to either require or even forbid for Routes to rely on a default Gateway.As a cluster operator, you can designate a Gateway as a default
by setting the (new)  field:Operators can choose to have no default Gateways, or even multiple.How it works and key detailsTo maintain a clean, GitOps-friendly workflow, a default Gateway does  modify the  of your Route. Instead, the binding is reflected in the Route's  field. You can always inspect the  stanza of your Route to see exactly which Gateway or Gateways have accepted it. This preserves your original intent and avoids conflicts with CD tools.The design explicitly supports having multiple Gateways designated as defaults within a cluster. When this happens, a defaulted Route will bind to  of them. This enables cluster operators to perform zero-downtime migrations and testing of new default Gateways.You can create a single Route that handles both north-south traffic (traffic entering or leaving the cluster, via a default Gateway) and east-west/mesh traffic (traffic between services within the cluster), by explicitly referencing a Service in .Default Gateways represent a significant step forward in making the Gateway API simpler and more intuitive for everyday use cases, bridging the gap between the flexibility needed by operators and the simplicity desired by developers.Configuring client certificate validationThis release brings updates for configuring client certificate validation, addressing a critical security vulnerability related to connection reuse.
HTTP connection coalescing is a web performance optimization that allows a client to reuse an existing TLS connection
for requests to different domains. While this reduces the overhead of establishing new connections, it introduces a security risk
in the context of API gateways.
The ability to reuse a single TLS connection across multiple Listeners brings the need to introduce shared client certificate
configuration in order to avoid unauthorized access.Why SNI-based mTLS is not the answerOne might think that using Server Name Indication (SNI) to differentiate between Listeners would solve this problem.
However, TLS SNI is not a reliable mechanism for enforcing security policies in a connection coalescing scenario.
A client could use a single TLS connection for multiple peer connections, as long as they are all covered by the same certificate.
This means that a client could establish a connection by indicating one peer identity (using SNI), and then reuse that connection
to access a different virtual host that is listening on the same IP address and port. That reuse, which is controlled by client side
heuristics, could bypass mutual TLS policies that were specific to the second listener configuration.Here's an example to help explain it:I have configured a Gateway with two listeners, both having overlapping hostnames.
My intention is for the  listener to be accessible only by clients presenting the  certificate.
In contrast, the  listener should allow access to a broader audience using any certificate valid for the  domain.Consider a scenario where a client initially connects to . The server requests and successfully validates the
 certificate, establishing the connection. Subsequently, the same client wishes to access other sites within this domain,
such as , which is handled by the  listener. Due to connection reuse,
clients can access  backends without an additional TLS handshake on the existing connection.
This process functions as expected.However, a critical security vulnerability arises when the order of access is reversed.
If a client first connects to  and presents a valid  certificate, the connection is successfully established.
If this client then attempts to access , the existing connection's client certificate will not be re-validated.
This allows the client to bypass the specific certificate requirement for the  backend, leading to a serious security breach.The solution: per-port TLS configurationThe updated Gateway API gains a  field in the  of a Gateway, that allows you to define a default client certificate
validation configuration for all Listeners, and then if needed override it on a per-port basis. This provides a flexible and
powerful way to manage your TLS policies.Here’s a look at the updated API definitions (shown as Go source code):Standard GRPCRoute -  field required (technicality)The promotion of GRPCRoute to Standard introduces a minor but technically breaking change regarding the presence of the top-level  field.
As part of achieving Standard status, the Gateway API has tightened the OpenAPI schema validation within the GRPCRoute
CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)
to explicitly ensure the spec field is required for all GRPCRoute resources.
This change enforces stricter conformance to Kubernetes object standards and enhances the resource's stability and predictability.
While it is highly unlikely that users were attempting to define a GRPCRoute without any specification, any existing automation
or manifests that might have relied on a relaxed interpretation allowing a completely absent  field will now fail validation
and  be updated to include the  field, even if empty.Experimental CORS support in HTTPRoute - breaking change for  fieldThe Gateway API subproject has introduced a breaking change to the Experimental CORS support in HTTPRoute, concerning the  field
within the CORS policy.
This field's definition has been strictly aligned with the upstream CORS specification, which dictates that the corresponding
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header must represent a Boolean value.
Previously, the implementation might have been overly permissive, potentially accepting non-standard or string representations such as
 due to relaxed schema validation.
Users who were configuring CORS rules must now review their manifests and ensure the value for 
strictly conforms to the new, more restrictive schema.
Any existing HTTPRoute definitions that do not adhere to this stricter validation will now be rejected by the API server,
requiring a configuration update to maintain functionality.Improving the development and usage experienceAs part of this release, we have improved some of the developer experience workflow:Added Kube API Linter to the CI/CD pipelines, reducing the burden of API reviewers and also reducing the amount of common mistakes.Improving the execution time of CRD tests with the usage of .Additionally, as part of the effort to improve Gateway API usage experience, some efforts were made to remove some ambiguities and some old tech-debts from our documentation website:The API reference is now explicit when a field is .The GEP (GatewayAPI Enhancement Proposal) navigation bar is automatically generated, reflecting the real status of the enhancements.Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of
Kubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running
Kubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this version
of Gateway API.As of this writing, seven implementations are already conformant with Gateway API v1.4.0. In alphabetical order:Wondering when a feature will be added? There are lots of opportunities to get
involved and help define the future of Kubernetes routing APIs for both ingress
and service mesh.The maintainers would like to thank  who's contributed to Gateway
API, whether in the form of commits to the repo, discussion, ideas, or general
support. We could never have made this kind of progress without the support of
this dedicated and active community.Related Kubernetes blog articles]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Is Supercharging the War on Libraries, Education, and Human Knowledge</title><link>https://www.404media.co/ai-is-supercharging-the-war-on-libraries-education-and-human-knowledge/</link><author>Jason Koebler</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/11/steve-johnson-YYyBa-701P8-unsplash.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:13:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month, a company called the Children’s Literature Comprehensive Database announced a new version of a product called Class-Shelf Plus. The software, which is used by school libraries to keep track of which books are in their catalog, added several new features including “AI-driven automation and contextual risk analysis,” which includes an AI-powered “sensitive material marker” and a “traffic-light risk ratings” system. The company says that it believes this software will streamline the arduous task school libraries face when trying to comply with legislation that bans certain books and curricula: “Districts using Class-Shelf Plus v3 may reduce manual review workloads by more than 80%, empowering media specialists and administrators to devote more time to instructional priorities rather than compliance checks,” it said in a press release.In a white paper published by CLCD, it gave a “real-world example: the role of CLCD in overcoming a book ban.” The paper then describes something that does not sound like “overcoming” a book ban at all. CLCD’s software simply suggested other books “without the contested content.” Ajay Gupte, the president of CLCD, told 404 Media the software is simply being piloted at the moment, but that it  “allows districts to make the majority of their classroom collections publicly visible—supporting transparency and access—while helping them identify a small subset of titles that might require review under state guidelines.” He added that “This process is designed to assist districts in meeting legislative requirements and protect teachers and librarians from accusations of bias or non-compliance [...] It is purpose-built to help educators defend their collections with clear, data-driven evidence rather than subjective opinion.”Librarians told 404 Media that AI library software like this is just the tip of the iceberg; they are being inundated with new pitches for AI library tech and catalogs are being flooded with AI slop books that they need to wade through. But more broadly, AI maximalism across society is supercharging the ideological war on libraries, schools, government workers, and academics. CLCD and Class Shelf Plus is a small but instructive example of something that librarians and educators have been telling me: The boosting of artificial intelligence by big technology firms, big financial firms, and government agencies is not separate from book bans, educational censorship efforts, and the war on education, libraries, and government workers being pushed by groups like the Heritage Foundation and any number of MAGA groups across the United States. This long-running war on knowledge and expertise has sown the ground for the narratives widely used by AI companies and the CEOs adopting it. Human labor, inquiry, creativity, and expertise is spurned in the name of “efficiency.” With AI, there is no need for human expertise because anything can be learned, approximated, or created in seconds. And with AI, there is less room for nuance in things like classifying or tagging books to comply with laws; an LLM or a machine algorithm can decide whether content is “sensitive.”“I see something like this, and it’s presented as very value neutral, like, ‘Here’s something that is going to make life easier for you because you have all these books you need to review,’” Jaime Taylor, discovery & resource management systems coordinator for the W.E.B. Du Bois Library at the University of Massachusetts told me in a phone call. “And I look at this and immediately I am seeing a tool that’s going to be used for censorship because this large language model is ingesting all the titles you have, evaluating them somehow, and then it might spit out an inaccurate evaluation. Or it might spit out an accurate evaluation and then a strapped-for-time librarian or teacher will take whatever it spits out and weed their collections based on it. It’s going to be used to remove books from collections that are about queerness or sexuality or race or history. But institutions are going to buy this product because they have a mandate from state legislatures to do this, or maybe they want to do this, right?”The resurgent war on knowledge, academics, expertise, and critical thinking that AI is currently supercharging has its roots in the hugely successful recent war on “critical race theory,” “diversity equity and inclusion,” and LGBTQ+ rights that painted librarians, teachers, scientists, and public workers as untrustworthy. This has played out across the board, with a seemingly endless number of ways in which the AI boom directly intersects with the right’s war on libraries, schools, academics, and government workers. There are DOGE’s mass layoffs of “woke” government workers, and the plan to replace them with AI agents and supposed AI-powered efficiencies. There are “parents rights” groups that pushed to ban books and curricula that deal with the teaching of slavery, systemic racism, and LGBTQ+ issues and attempted to replace them with homogenous curricula and “approved” books that teach one specific type of American history and American values; and there are the AI tools that have been altered to not be “woke” and to reenforce the types of things the administration wants you to think. Many teachers feel they are not allowed to teach about slavery or racism and increasingly spend their days grading student essays that were actually written by robots.“One thing that I try to make clear any time I talk about book bans is that it’s not about the books, it’s about deputizing bigots to do the ugly work of defunding all of our public institutions of learning,” Maggie Tokuda-Hall, a cofounder of Authors Against Book Bans, told me. “The current proliferation of AI that we see particularly in the library and education spaces would not be possible at the speed and scale that is happening without the precedent of book bans leading into it. They are very comfortable bedfellows because once you have created a culture in which all expertise is denigrated and removed from the equation and considered nonessential, you create the circumstances in which AI can flourish.”Justin, a cohost of the podcast librarypunk, told me that the project of offloading cognitive capacity to AI continues apace: “Part of a fascist project to offload the work of thinking, especially the reflective kind of thinking that reading, study, and community engagement provide,” Justin said. “That kind of thinking cultivates empathy and challenges your assumptions. It's also something you have to practice. If we can offload that cognitive work, it's far too easy to become reflexive and hateful, while having a robot cheerleader telling you that you were right about everything all along.”These two forces—the war on libraries, classrooms, and academics and AI boosterism—are not working in a vacuum. The Heritage Foundation’s right-wing agenda for remaking the federal government, , talks about criminalizing teachers and librarians who “poison our own children” and pushing artificial intelligence into every corner of the government for data analysis and “waste, fraud, and abuse” detection. Librarians, teachers, and government workers have had to spend an increasing amount of their time and emotional bandwidth defending the work that they do, fighting against censorship efforts and dealing with the associated stress, harassment, and threats that come from fighting educational censorship. Meanwhile, they are separately dealing with an onslaught of AI slop and the top-down mandated AI-ification of their jobs; there are simply fewer and fewer hours to do what they actually want to be doing, which is helping patrons and students.“The last five years of library work, of public service work has been a nightmare, with ongoing harassment and censorship efforts that you’re either experiencing directly or that you’re hearing from your other colleagues,” Alison Macrina, executive director of Library Freedom Project, told me in a phone interview. “And then in the last year-and-a-half or so, you add to it this enormous push for the AIfication of your library, and the enormous demands on your time. Now you have these already overworked public servants who are being expected to do even more because there’s an expectation to use AI, or that AI will do it for you. But they’re dealing with things like the influx of AI-generated books and other materials that are being pushed by vendors.” The future being pushed by both AI boosters and educational censors is one where access to information is tightly controlled. Children will not be allowed to read certain books or learn certain narratives. “Research” will be performed only through one of a select few artificial intelligence tools owned by AI giants which are uniformly aligned behind the Trump administration and which have gone to the ends of the earth to prevent their black box machines from spitting out “woke” answers lest they catch the ire of the administration. School boards and library boards, forced to comply with increasingly restrictive laws, funding cuts, and the threat of being defunded entirely, leap at the chance to be considered forward looking by embracing AI tools, or apply for grants from government groups like the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which is increasingly giving out grants specifically to AI projects.We previously reported that the ebook service Hoopla, used by many libraries, has been flooded with AI-generated books (the company has said it is trying to cull these from its catalog). In a recent survey of librarians, Macrina’s organization found that librarians are getting inundated with pitches from AI companies and are being pushed by their superiors to adopt AI: “People in the survey results kept talking about, like, I get 10 aggressive, pushy emails a day from vendors demanding that I implement their new AI product or try it, jump on a call. I mean, the burdens have become so much, I don’t even know how to summarize them.”“Fascism and AI, whether or not they have the same goals, they sure are working to accelerate one another"Macrina said that in response to Library Freedom Project’s recent survey, librarians said that misinformation and disinformation was their biggest concern. This came not just in the form of book bans and censorship but also in efforts to proactively put disinformation and right-wing talking points into libraries: “It’s not just about book bans, and library board takeovers, and the existing reactionary attacks on libraries. It’s also the effort to push more far-right material into libraries,” she said. “And then you have librarians who are experiencing a real existential crisis because they are getting asked by their jobs to promote [AI] tools that produce more misinformation. It's the most, like, emperor-has-no-clothes-type situation that I have ever witnessed.” Each person I spoke to for this article told me they could talk about the right-wing project to erode trust in expertise, and the way AI has amplified this effort, for hours. In writing this article, I realized that I could endlessly tie much of our reporting on attacks on civil society and human knowledge to the force multiplier that is AI and the AI maximalist political and economic project. One need look no further than Grokipedia as one of the many recent reminders of this effort—a project by the world’s richest man and perhaps its most powerful right-wing political figure to replace a crowdsourced, meticulously edited fount of human knowledge with a robotic imitation built to further his political project. Much of what we write about touches on this: The plan to replace government workers with AI, the general erosion of truth on social media, the rise of AI slop that “feels” true because it reinforces a particular political narrative but is not true, the fact that teachers feel like they are forced to allow their students to use AI. Justin, from librarypunk, said AI has given people “absolute impunity to ignore reality […] AI is a direct attack on the way we verify information: AI both creates fake sources and obscures its actual sources.”That is the opposite of what librarians do, and teachers do, and scientists do, and experts do. But the political project to devalue the work these professionals do, and the incredible amount of money invested in pushing AI as a replacement for that human expertise, have worked in tandem to create a horrible situation for all of us.“AI is an agreement machine, which is anathema to learning and critical thinking,” Tokuda-Hall said. Previously we have had experts like librarians and teachers to help them do these things, but they have been hamstrung and they’ve been attacked and kneecapped and we’ve created a culture in which their contribution is completely erased from society, which makes something like AI seem really appealing. It’s filling that vacuum.”“Fascism and AI, whether or not they have the same goals, they sure are working to accelerate one another,” she added. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Automattic Inc.

--

Differences in leg length can emerge for various reasons, from genetic and hormonal conditions to injuries that impact bone growth. But while we still don’t know exactly what degree of difference causes health issues, doctors have made great strides in figuring out how to even out these mismatched limbs. Jason Shih Hoellwarth digs into the benefits and limitations of bone lengthening surgery.

DESCRIPTION
Barbara Lampl interviews Larysa Visengeriyeva, software engineer and "godmother of MLOps", about her new book on AI engineering and compliance. What starts as a discussion about the EU AI Act quickly reveals a deeper truth: the real challenge isn't regulatory compliance - it's fundamental engineering practices.

Larysa argues that quality AI systems require robust MLOps, comprehensive documentation, and proper data governance, whether regulation mandates it or not. Drawing from frameworks like CRISP-ML and the Machine Learning Canvas, the book provides practical checklists and methodologies for taking AI projects from prototype to production. Written partially in Ukraine during wartime, this "battle-tested" guide addresses the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, offering a common language for building sustainable AI systems.
