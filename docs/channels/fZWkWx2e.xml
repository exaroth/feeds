KangIn this episode of the Team Deakins Podcast, we learn about LED lighting. LEDs are now commonplace in productions, and we thought an episode about the technology and its applications could be helpful for anyone with as many questions as us. Our guest is Tim S. Kang, a cinematographer and the principal engineer for imaging applications at Aputure, and we start by learning how Tim came to work on this side of the business. He also helps us understand a number of topics, including: the history of lighting in cinema, the definition of spectrum, the evolution of LEDs, and the possibilities of lighting in post. We also discuss the efforts to institute a standard among LED fixtures, and we reflect on the historical problem cinematographers have always faced: inconsistencies with light sources.This episode is sponsored by Aputure & Sandstorm]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>June Squibb&apos;s Closet Picks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0nb9ECXdGE</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/K0nb9ECXdGE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 16:52:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The actor shares her longtime love for the films of Akira Kurosawa, talks about seeing CHILDREN OF PARADISE at an art-house cinema in the 1940s, and fondly recalls riding a scooter with Richard Roundtree.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cillian Murphy + THE WES ANDERSON ARCHIVE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rf530YO8J-k</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rf530YO8J-k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 18:11:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cillian Murphy shows love for Wes Anderson in the Criterion Closet!

- The villa used in Burial Ground is the same location used in the 2024 film Immaculate

- The actor that plays one of the main werewolf henchmen in Howling 2 also played escaped convict Mickey in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure

- Lakefront's Pumpkin Imperial Ale doesn't have a very high ABV but if you drink a whole bunch of them quickly, you'll still be slurring your words and borderline incoherent (even if you are able to eek out one very good wooden-puppet-related pun that nobody even reacts to)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mark Kermode reviews Regretting You</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAv6jR27FCM</link><author>Kermode and Mayo&apos;s Take</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dAv6jR27FCM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:31:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErmMCK1sHF-kCtyHpuSXtQ">Movies - Kermode</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#MarkKermode #SimonMayo #FilmReviews

It’s a space for those of you who don’t just want to hear the Take, but want to be part of it. Maybe you’ve shouted at us through your headphones, certain we’d missed the point of a film (Mark), or simply wanted Simon to get a word in edgeways. Maybe you just want more film chat, more recommendations, and more of us trying — and failing — to keep to time.

We want you to be at the heart of this so contact us and let us know what you’d like to see and hear on Patreon, and we’ll do our best.

Fresh off the headlines of a real-life Louvre robbery, indie auteur Kelly Reichardt and breakout star Josh O’Connor join Simon to talk about their buzzy new film, The Mastermind—a stylish 70s-set art-heist drama that’s suddenly feeling very timely. O’Connor plays JB, a slacker dad whose low-stakes gallery theft spirals into something far more chaotic. Expect Nixon-era nostalgia, vintage fashion deep-dives, and awkward ovation etiquette. Plus, Josh spills on his upcoming Spielberg project—yes, that Spielberg. 

 

Mark Reviews: 

 

The Mastermind – Does Reichardt’s latest live up to the hype? 
Regretting You – A romantic drama with a title tailor-made for snark. Mark’s rant radar is fully activated. 
Sketch – A family film where kids’ drawings come to life. But does the magic hold up? 
Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere – Jeremy Allen White stars as The Boss in this hotly anticipated biopic. Does it rock or roll off the rails?

The film was shot extensively using modified iPhones, and Anthony shares his early conversations with director Danny Boyle about the film's intended rural setting that informed their decision to commit to using the devices. Anthony later explains how he jailbroke the iPhone's camera system with the help of tech advisors and employees at Apple, and we discuss how the limitations of the phone forced Anthony to adjust the amount of light he used while filming. We also learn how the bar cam system actually works, and Anthony details the type of VFX work done throughout the film. We later investigate why the sequel was shot with an Alexa, and Anthony describes the elaborate build of the Bone Temple location featured prominently in both films.Recommended Viewing: 28 YEARS LATERThis episode is sponsored by Sandstorm & Aputure]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Benny Safdie’s Closet Picks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3aEv64x4Fo</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q3aEv64x4Fo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:04:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The writer, director, and actor returns to the Criterion Closet, where he shares how he and cinematographer Maceo Bishop studied documentaries like THE WAR ROOM when making their new film THE SMASHING MACHINE, shouts out the singular performances in CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, and talks about watching FLOW with his kids and their cat.

He didn’t break out in Hollywood until his forties, and even then he refused to sell out.

Throughout the 80s and 90s he worked in smaller roles and smaller films. But then came The Lord of the Rings. Cast at the last minute as Aragorn, he threw himself into the role, breaking toes on camera, doing nearly all of his own stunts, and even carrying his sword everywhere he went. The trilogy made him a star, but that was never the point.

Instead of cashing in, he turned down other franchises and bigger projects, choosing riskier films instead like A HIstory of Violence, Eastern Promises and Captain Fantastic. He starved himself for The Road, stuffed himself with pizza for Green Book, and earned Oscar nominations along the way.

For him, fame was never the goal. Acting, painting, writing, and music were all just different ways to express himself, not ways to be seen.

This is the story of when an actor didn’t care about fame, and only focused on the work itself. This is Viggo Mortensen.

In return you’ll get a whole extra Take 2 alongside Take 1 every week, with bonus reviews, more viewing recommendations from the Good Doctors and whole bonus episodes just for you. And if you’re already a Vanguardista, we salute you. 

Another packed show this week with four movie reviews for your listening pleasure. First up, ‘Black Phone 2’ -- the sequel to 2021’s comms-based chiller, starring Ethan Hawke. Like a lot of horror movies, the fact that his character died in the last film isn’t really a big deal. Speaking of reanimation, we’ve got Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein too—a fresh take on the much-adapted classic horror novel, this time starring Jacob Elordi as the monster. ‘Roofman’ sees Channing Tatum hiding in a Toys ‘R’ Us in a crime caper based on a bizarre true story from ‘The Place Beyond The Pines’ director Derek Cianfrance—and finally, a new Luca Guadagnino out this week too. ‘After The Hunt’ stars Julia Roberts as a Yale college professor frustrated by her student’s allegations against a colleague... and it’s ripe to get under Mark’s skin—so buckle up for that one. 

Plus, those of you who enjoyed Mark’s review of ‘Plainclothes’ last week will be pleased to hear that this week we’re welcoming the very lovely Russell Tovey to the show. The charged drama follows an undercover cop assigned to arrest gay men at cruising spots—and Russell plays a target who becomes an unexpected love interest. He and Simon unpack the film and how it speaks to today—plus a bit of art chat and a mysterious arty paperback too... 

Strap in too for what we think is an especially good Laughter Lift, if we do say so ourselves—and more of your top correspondence answered—including a fascinating neuroscientific take on tearjerkers. Link here to the article mentioned in that one: https://medium.com/@itsanavidreader/why-we-cry-at-movies-but-not-real-life-the-psychology-behind-emotional-processing-de18f2dbf624
