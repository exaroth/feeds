Amanda Seyfried is our special guest this week. She’s starred in Mean Girls, The Housemaid and Mamma Mia!, but she’s never been a Mancunian... until now. She joins Simon alongside writer-director Mona Fastvold to talk about The Testament of Ann Lee, in which Seyfried stars as the titular leader of the Shakers. You might not have heard of her and the 18th century radical religious sect she founded—and we promise you’ve definitely never seen a musical about her. Seyfried talks about her struggle to crack a Manchester accent for the role, never mind all that ecstatic song and dance—and we hear from Fastvold about he old-school filmmaking techniques that helped her and co-writer husband Brady Corbet bring this unique story to the screen on shoestring budget.  

Mark will review The Testament of Ann Lee next week, but we’ve got four more movie reviews for you in the meantime—it's a packed show! First, The Secret Agent, where paranoia and deception collide as an ex-academic gets caught up in South American political turmoil. Then there’s If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, a darkly comic tale of maternal burnout pushed to surreal extremes. We also have Wasteman—a gritty prison drama starring Rye Lane’s David Jonsson. And finally, Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die, a genre-bending evil-tech adventure starring Sam Rockwell.  

Plus all the usual delights: the box office top 10, the unpredictable joy of the Laughter Lift, and your tip-top correspondence. Don’t miss it.

You asked for it! Here it is! MOAR TRIVIA! This time, the elderly clown-man, Mike curates a bunch of random questions about horror pictures for Jay and Josh to answer and be made fools of. Finding questions that didn’t seem too easy or too hard was actually kind of difficult. Mike knows some things about horror, but not too mech. He nows moar about Star Trek and eating ultra processed foods from the Dollar Store. Did you know he shops for groceries at the Dollar Store?!? I once caught that man eating a box of shortbread cookies and ramen noodles for “dinner” then for a dessert he had a generic brand frozen pizza with a bottle of that sugar juice. I looked at the “nutritional” facts on the pizza. Zeros in all categories except carbohydrates and sodium. 50,000mg of sodium - 100 million times your recommended daily amount. Same with the carbs. 250 million grams of carbohydrates. 55 billion times your daily limit. That’s like eating liquid concrete. No food value. Anyway, I digress. Jay and special guest Josh Roger Thompson join the gang for this embarrassing trivia show down. Josh knows horror though. Him and Jay chat it up constantly. Like the saying goes, Jay is Josh’s brother from another individual(s) that currently identifies as a woman or person or person(s) assigned that specific gender or non-gender at birth. Josh knows lots of things, but he’s no match for Jay’s recall. Jay can remember mostly any actor from any movie. His memory is a steel bear trap. But I guess the biggest takeaway from this whole video is that Josh thinks Shaun of the Dead is “Hipster horse sh*t” “A two star film at best”. Get ready for the battle of the century as these two titans of weird perv*rted horror movies duke it out in a filthy Wisconsin warehouse!!!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JACK FISK - Production Designer</title><link>https://teamdeakins.libsyn.com/jack-fisk-production-designer</link><author></author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/teamdeakins/S2-181_Jack_Fisk_Final_Aputure-PictureShop-SPlea.mp3?dest-id=2018942" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.rogerdeakins.com/">Movies - Team Deakins</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[SEASON 2 - EPISODE 181 - Jack Fisk - Production DesignerIn this extended episode of the Team Deakins Podcast, we speak with production designer Jack Fisk (MARTY SUPREME, THERE WILL BE BLOOD, MULHOLLAND DRIVE).

Bodices will be ripped in this week’s Take, because we’re talking Wuthering Heights. Emerald Fennell heads to the wild and windy moors for a cinematic storm of obsession, repression, lots of rain and, well… let’s just say nobody’s getting this worked up about the weather alone. Controversially starring Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff and Margot Robbie as Catherine, it’s already dividing the critics, so where does Mark stand?  

The lascivious literary adaptation’s director is our guest this week. She joins Simon to talk about the story’s sensuality, toxicity, and how much glaring, breathing, and storm-lashed longing is too much glaring, breathing, and storm-lashed longing? She tells us how it felt to realise her teenage dream of bringing her vision for this classic to the screen, and why its tale of love, revenge, and emotional chaos still gets pulses racing. 

Plus reviews of three more of the week’s cinematic offerings. There’s Crime 101, Bart Layton’s sleek thriller pairing Chris Hemsworth’s precision jewel thief with Mark Ruffalo’s relentlessly pursuing detective, and proving once again that nobody in LA should ever relax. Whistle brings supernatural horror and the world’s worst extracurricular activity, as students discover that cursed ancient Aztec artefacts are best left well alone. And Little Amélie offers something altogether gentler — an animated adaptation of Amélie Nothomb’s autobiographical story of childhood, identity, and wonder. 

All this, plus the box office top 10, a trip to the dizziest heights of humour in the Laughter Lift, and the customary digressions and delights of another top Take.

"How can a score function within a film?" is the question driving most of our conversation with Nicholas, and throughout the episode he generously provides insight into his process and recalls several examples from his own work to demonstrate how he and his directors arrived at specific pieces of music. We also reflect on the varying natures of scores across film history, and Nicholas shares the challenges of composing for television. He also shares the types of conversations he has with directors after he's brought onto a project, and we learn how he developed the themes for JAY KELLY, DON'T LOOK UP, and THE BIG SHORT. In addition to composing full scores, Nicholas has also contributed music heard within a film's world—during the development of 12 YEARS A SLAVE, he was brought on to compose the songs played in individual scenes, and he reflects on how he balanced the music as both a dramatic element and a piece of history.

An astonishing creation, LIMITE is the only feature by the Brazilian director and author Mário Peixoto, made when he was just twenty-two years old. Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others. An early work of independent Latin American filmmaking, LIMITE was famously difficult to see for most of the twentieth century. It is a pioneering achievement that continues to captivate with its timeless visual poetry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Laura Dern’s Closet Picks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2IZf_NRJKs</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/c2IZf_NRJKs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 9 Feb 2026 18:42:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The actor fondly recalls the gift of working with David Lynch on INLAND EMPIRE, praises the comedic brilliance of Albert Brooks, and  pairs Robert Altman and Spike Lee as directors whose films capture “the essence of culture, community, and truth.”

Benicio Del Toro is underrated. He never comes up in “best actor” conversations, but give him any size role next to the biggest stars in Hollywood and he’ll steal the whole film.

In The Usual Suspects, he realized how small his part was, so he turned it into something unforgettable. In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he put on 40 pounds, and brought a kind of chaos no one else could pull off. And his later work, he was always willing to cut down his own roles for the good of the film, cutting most of his dialogue in The Way of the Gun, and taking it even further in Sicario, where silence does most of the work.

When you take a step back and look at his career, it’s all over the place. After winning the Oscar for Traffic, it felt like a transition into a decade as a leading man. Instead, his career got weird. Flops, overlooked performances, and long stretches where Hollywood never quite figured out what to do with him. Until decades after that Oscar, when they finally did with The French Dispatch, The Phoenician Scheme and One Battle After Another.

This is the story of when an actor wasn’t used enough, sometimes by choice, and sometimes by the industry. This is Benicio Del Toro.

Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show—a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time.  
It’s the take you’ve all been waiting for... Mark’s Melania review. Did he enjoy this, er, ‘documentary’ about the FLOTUS? Obviously not. Will you enjoy listening to him slate it? We think so. Buckle up.  

Our guest this week is Riz Ahmed—actor, musician, writer and all-round creative force—joining Simon to talk about his bold new film adaptation of Hamlet. Reimagining Shakespeare’s most introspective tragedy for the screen, Ahmed takes on the iconic role of the Prince of Denmark in a version that fuses classic text with contemporary urgency. He tells Simon what it means to wrestle with “to be or not to be” in the modern world.  

Mark also reviews Hamlet, plus three more of this week’s notable releases. There’s Send Help, Sam Raimi’s survival thriller that strands its characters in a fight against both nature and themselves; The Chronology of Water, a visceral adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir, and Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut; and It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley, a documentary portrait of the elusive, mythic musician whose influence still reverberates decades on. 

All this, plus the box office top 10, the lofty pleasures of the Laughter Lift, and the usual conversational twists, turns, and small-hill-pedantry you’ve come to expect.

Kelly and Christopher started working together on MEEK'S CUTOFF, and they've continued their partnership through films such as FIRST COW, SHOWING UP, and THE MASTERMIND. During the conversation, Kelly (from Miami) shares how she made it out of Florida to join the film community in New York City, and Chris (from Los Angeles) reveals how he found himself following his filmmaking family into the business after a youth of truancy and rebellion. Later, we discuss their working relationship, and we learn why they ended up meeting in the first place. We also spend much of the conversation discussing the making of their latest film, THE MASTERMIND, and we discuss the film's pacing and our changing relationship to time as an audience.
