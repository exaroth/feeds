He never planned to be an actor. He never expected to learn English or work in Hollywood. For most of his early career, he assumed he would stay in Spain until Before Night Falls earned him an Oscar nomination. What started as an experiment changed the direction of his career.

Soon after, Bardem became the first Spanish actor to win an Oscar for No Country for Old Men, delivering one of the most iconic villain performances ever. Hollywood took notice, pushing him into major studio films like Skyfall, where he did it again.

But Bardem never abandoned Spanish cinema. Some of his best work came outside Hollywood, in films like The Sea Inside and Biutiful. As his Hollywood momentum grew, that balance became harder to maintain, eventually leading to the worst stretch of his career. It was only when Bardem focused on both Spanish films and Hollywood that everything clicked again, with performances in The Good Boss, Being the Ricardos and Dune.

This is the story of when an actor didn’t need Hollywood, moving in and out of it without ever letting it define him. This is Javier Bardem.

Finally! But it's season one you say? You're right! Rarely are the first seasons of shows outright exceptional (with some outright exceptions) most times they're good enough to pass muster, until they find stable footing. Deep Space Nine is no different! Light years ahead of the awkward first season of TNG, DS9 slides right into it's groove early on. While there are lots of isolated TNG-esque one-off story lines and some early character developing episodes, DS9 season one is a solid layer of quality "paste" as Rich Evans so eloquently puts it. Rich and Mark talk briefly about each episode, pausing to pick favorites along these way. Watch them two old, confused, boring, elderly, genXer scumbags wax nostalgic for quaint old television before the time of woke nightmare sauce spilling out of every eyeball. Before shows made it based on viewership ratings and not streaming service fodder for animal troughs of marketable IP's and stock market shareholder data portfolios for investors. In addition to the Matlock reboot for the olds, we've got this over-produced glossy, fast moving, fart-filled, hip gen-zers (not watching Star Trek I can assure you) tiktok framed clips and nightmare fuel. This embarrassing attempt by old cracker boomer producers to create a program to appeal to Z's that not a single one will take the time to watch. out-of-touch,  buzz-worthy hip-hop, busin' zazz dancin' kidz in Starfleet, bouncing pronouns off the shields as they flubba dubb to the latest crunchy zen-dash touch grass brah. Stella zoinks, lady no cap! You going to the no-alcohol Trek bash in Hall H later where WE DANCE with Starfleet costumes and tell each other we're boss-folks and learn about ourselves while respecting each other's rizz? Heck yeah! It's gonna be tripe and no one there will be sus or clutch fringe cringe. Insta-gram it for me brah! I'll be beaming in later after my exams!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FULL SHOW: Jack O’Connell on 28 YEARS LATER: THE BONE TEMPLE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIbCOn1qicM</link><author>Kermode and Mayo&apos;s Take</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dIbCOn1qicM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErmMCK1sHF-kCtyHpuSXtQ">Movies - Kermode</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Some exciting news—The Take is now on Patreon: www.patreon.com/kermodeandmayo.

The chilling on screen (but charming IRL) Jack O’Connell joins us on the Take this week to talk 28 Years Later: the Bone Temple. Directed by Nia DaCosta, who loyal listeners may remember from our live Christmas Extravaganza, it’s the second installment in a sequel trilogy to Danny Boyle’s zombie smash hit. Jack talks tracksuits, tiaras and being the most villainous actor of the past year—plus lots more on-set insights from the horror-thriller that’s got you all talking. Don;t miss this one!  
Mark reviews Bone Temple too, plus more of this week’s fresh new films. First up, Rental Family—which sees Brendan Fraser’s Philip join a Japanese agency providing fake ‘family for hire’ for its clients’ social and companionship needs. Plus a tougher but important watch, The Voice of Hind Rajab, which replays the tragic death of six-year-old Hind Rajab—killed in Gaza in January 2024—based on real audio of her final recorded calls to the Palestine Red Crescent Society and the efforts of its volunteers to save her life.  
Plus all the usual top quality nonsense on all things film-related and beyond, and your emergency mails of course. Thanks for listening!

We worked with Chris on SKYFALL, and we had a great time catching up with him. In addition to production design, Chris has had a long career as an art director, and he helps us understand how the two positions work together on any given project and what each one's responsibilities are. Throughout the episode, Chris also shares his strategies for communicating with directors and producers, creatively adapting to shifting budgets, and delegating duties to members of the art department. We also reflect on why and how the Shanghai skyscraper scene in SKYFALL pivoted from a location to a set, and Chris shares an episode of creative problem solving from THE LAST JEDI involving the Millennium Flacon, Yoda, and a tree.

Embeth's directorial debut, DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT (an adaptation of the book of the same name written by Alexandra Fuller), is one of our favourite films from this past year, and we spend most of our conversation learning how Embeth pulled it off. The film is centered around the experiences of a young white child living in Zimbabwe at the end of the Rhodesian Bush War, and Embeth shares how her own childhood memories of South Africa's Apartheid influenced her telling of the story. Among many topics, we discuss: the film's effective use of voiceover, Embeth's approach to directing the lead child actress, managing a monkey break-in on location, the deceptive allure of the Steadicam, how the movie was financed, and whether or not she considered changing the title. We also reflect on the challenges of navigating a career in the entertainment industry, and we learn what Embeth has planned next.Recommended viewing: DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHTThis episode is sponsored by Aputure]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will Arnett’s Closet Picks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE2G9pU6PbM</link><author>CRITERION</author><category>movies</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KE2G9pU6PbM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 19:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E">Movies - Criterion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The actor shares his love for STRANGER THAN PARADISE and DEKALOG, talks about being both freaked out and deeply moved by THE TIN DRUM, and praises Richard E.
