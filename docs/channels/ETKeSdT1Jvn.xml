Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

What actually happens in the brain during a near-death experience? Neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin shares groundbreaking research that reveals dramatic surges in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the moments before death. These chemical floods may explain the feelings of euphoria, tunnels of light, and out-of-body sensations reported by millions. Is this evidence of the afterlife—or proof that the dying brain creates its own final visions?

Either way, fundamental reality is pure consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Idealism (like the common sense of the physical)?

What would it mean for God to be more than one person? ‘Three persons in one God’ is the Christian claim, and in what sense can ‘one God consisting of three persons’ even make sense? What would be the theology of multiple persons as God? Why three persons in the Godhead? What’s the difference between polytheism, many gods, and multiple persons in the same God?

If consciousness is 100% physical, we would have to conclude that the same kind of consciousness that we experience as humans can be generated by non-biological entities (eventually). Conversely, if non-biological consciousness would somehow, someday, prove impossible, then consciousness would have to embed some nonphysical aspect. But how would we ever know?

It’s an idea that runs counter to the materialist worldview we’re all taught in school. But the outer edges of scientific inquiry bleed into what can only be called ‘magic.’ With a uniquely science-backed approach, parapsychologist Dean Radin explores the "magical" elements of consciousness including telepathy, spell casting, conjuring spirits, and more.

Radin's book, "The Science of Magic: How the Mind Weaves the Fabric of Reality", is on sale now: https://amzn.to/3KXvPd7

Dean Radin is an American parapsychologist. Following a bachelor and master's degree in electrical engineering and a PhD in educational psychology Radin worked at Bell Labs, as a researcher at Princeton University and the University of Edinburgh, and was a faculty member at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Dan is joined by historian Dr Alanna Skuse to look at healthcare in Renaissance England, from healing the humours and blood letting to cross animal blood transfusions, skin grafts that involved attaching the face to the upper arm and the notorious treatments of patients at Bedlam, Britain's most famous psychiatric hospital. But not all treatments were bizarre or gruesome; in fact, early practitioners had some pretty progressive ideas around holistic health, the benefits of nature, sleep and friendship.Alanna shares astonishing stories of treatments, patients and practitioners from her new book 'The Surgeon, the Midwife and the Quack: How to Stay Alive in Renaissance England'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2397 - Richard Lindzen &amp; William Happer</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt32chvO_iY</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zt32chvO_iY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Richard Lindzen, PhD, is Professor Emeritus of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
