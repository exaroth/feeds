In every enterprise, value emerges from connections: customers to products, suppliers to shipments, molecules to targets. This talk introduces Relational Foundation Models (RFMs)—a new class of models that reason over interactions, not just data points. Drawing on advances in graph neural networks and large-scale ML systems, I’ll show how RFMs capture structure, enable richer reasoning, and deliver measurable business impact. Audience will learn where relational modeling drives the biggest wins, how to build the data backbone for it, and how to operationalize these models responsibly and at scale.Jure Leskovec is the co-founder of Kumo.AI, an enterprise AI company pioneering AI foundation models that can reason over structured business data. He is also a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and a leading researcher in artificial intelligence, best known for pioneering Graph Neural Networks and creating PyG, the most widely used graph learning toolkit. Previously, Jure served as Chief Scientist at Pinterest and as an investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub. His research has been widely adopted in industry and government, powering applications at companies such as Meta, Uber, YouTube, Amazon, and more.

We know we humans are conscious and we strongly suspect higher animals are as well: for example, primates, dogs, cetaceans, whales and dolphins. But how far down the phylogenetic scale does consciousness go? Do fish feel pain? Do insects have awareness? Do bacteria sense? What are the implications?

Following a childhood marred by illness and death, John earned a medical degree before returning to run the Sanitorium – a health and wellness centre – in his hometown, where he prescribed a variety of treatments both sensible and surreal, including a vegetarian diet, fresh air and exercise, hydrotherapy, and regular enemas! He was soon joined in his wellness venture by his business-minded brother Will, and together they invented a breakfast cereal we still know and love today: cornflakes. But after years of John’s bullying, Will left to launch his own business: the Kellogg company.This episode tells the story of these battling brothers and their food and wellness business ventures, exploring everything from their sibling relationship and the competing stories they tell about the invention of their most famous cereal, to John’s Seventh Day Adventist beliefs and his pioneering wife with her meat-free meal replacements.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Charismatic, manipulative and unrepentant, he became the central figure of the proceedings. This episode examines Göring’s performance in the courtroom and his unusual relationship with U.S. Army psychiatrist Dr Douglas Kelley, who was tasked with assessing the mental state of the Nazi defendants.For this, we're joined by Jack El-Hai, author of ‘The Nazi and the Psychiatrist'. Through their exchanges, Jack explains how Göring sought to control his legacy and what his case revealed about the psychology of power and guilt in the aftermath of war.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>618.
