We know we humans are conscious and we strongly suspect higher animals are as well: for example, primates, dogs, cetaceans, whales and dolphins. But how far down the phylogenetic scale does consciousness go? Do fish feel pain? Do insects have awareness? Do bacteria sense? What are the implications?

Whether God exists may depend on whether God is necessary. ‘Necessary’, in the philosophical sense, means ‘impossible not to exist’. Even if God exists, would it have been possible for God not to exist? Namely, even if God does exist, could it have been otherwise? If it were possible that God not exist, then why would God, as God is defined, exist at all?

Since the fifteenth century, Chaucer has been referred to as the father of English literature. He was one of the first authors to champion the use of Middle English for poetry instead of Latin, and after the invention of the printing press, his works became the foundation of the English literary canon – long before Shakespeare ever put quill to parchment. But Chaucer’s life was as extraordinary as his legacy, living as he did through the Black Death, the Hundred Years’ War between England and France, and the Peasants’ Revolt. In this episode, Greg and his guests explore Chaucer’s dramatic biography: growing up the son of a wine merchant in fourteenth-century London, his work for the royal court and long career as a medieval civil servant, his relationship with John of Gaunt through his mistress Katherine Swynford, and his travels throughout Europe. They also examine the poets that influenced him – including Petrarch, Bocaccio and Dante – and take a deep dive into the famous Canterbury Tales.   
 
If you’re a fan of medieval literature, historical courtroom dramas, and the tumult of fourteenth-century England, you’ll love our episode on Geoffrey Chaucer.
 
If you want more literary history with Mike Wozniak, listen to our episodes on Charles Dickens at Christmas and the Legends of King Arthur. And for more fourteenth-century lives, check out our episode on medieval Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta. 
 
You’re Dead To Me is the comedy podcast that takes history seriously. Every episode, Greg Jenner brings together the best names in history and comedy to learn and laugh about the past.

Does the concept of observation have deep relevance in fundamental physics? What about in quantum physics where some kind of observation seems to be needed to transform “wave function” probabilities into actual events? What’s an “observation” anyway? What does it take to be an “observer”? Must it have some kind of sentience?

For God to be God, God must be infallible and know the future perfectly, including all my actions from birth to death. For my will to be free, my actions must not be constrained. But if God knows the future – if God literally knows now what I am going to do later – then how are my actions later not constrained? How then free will?

If ESP can claim some kind of truth, the implications would be profound. The confirmation of any ESP, no matter how minor, would challenge the materialism-physicalism structure of the world, built over centuries by science. Reality itself would expand. But extraordinary claims, such as for ESP or parapsychology, require extraordinary evidence.

Panpsychism is the theory that consciousness is irreducible and exists fundamentally at the foundations of reality. Panpsychism forms include ‘micropsychism,’ where fundamental particles or fields are in some sense conscious, and ‘Cosmopsychism,’ where the entire universe is in some sense conscious. What are the arguments for and against Panpsychism like the ‘combination problem’?

Speaker(s): Karan Jagtiani

---

This session is a practical, demo-driven walkthrough of how I being a cloud architect use an open source AI copilot called Skyflo.ai to speed up day-to-day DevOps and SRE workflows, without sacrificing safety or compliance. We'll dive into a real incident in a live Kubernetes environment with a Jenkins deployment, where the audience will see the AI agent in action, and how I prompt the agent to triage the incident, decide on the next steps, and act on it. Attendees will see how teams are cutting incident response time by utilizing Skyflo and it's human-in-the-loop approach.

Key Takeaways:

    Learn how I cut down incident response time by 50% at Storylane by using an AI copilot
    See how to use an AI copilot to speed up your Kubernetes, Argo, Helm, and Jenkins workflows
    Understand the human-in-the-loop architecture of Skyflo and behind the scenes of how it works


Live Demo Plan (70% time):
1) Trigger a deployment on Jenkins using Skyflo
2) Wait for the agent to report back with the status of the deployment
3) The pipeline will succeed, but the deployment in Kubernetes will fail
4) The agent will go through a process of discovery to find the root cause of the issue
5) The agent will decide on the next steps and act on it

Under-the-Hood (30% time):

    Brief Architecture Tour: How LangGraph and MCP are used to power the Skyflo agent
    Custom MCP Server: kubectl/helm/argo/jenkins with typed parameters and validation
    Streaming over SSE: Live events over Redis pub/sub and server-sent events over MCP

From the rivalries of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman kings to the scandals of the Plantagenets and the Georgians, this is a tumultuous account of Britain's monarchy through the ages. Written by Dan Snow, produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask Me Anything with Robert Lawrence Kuhn (Part IV)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgVGmcMPJBI</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WgVGmcMPJBI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Robert Lawrence Kuhn answers questions submitted by viewers on various topics like life after death, individualization, free will, and more.

Born into a middle class Black family in New York, a young Lena Horne soon followed in the footsteps of her actress mother and made her début at the famous Cotton Club aged only 16. After making her name as a singer and performer – and following the end of her tumultuous first marriage – Horne transferred to the west coast and bagged a Hollywood contract with MGM. There, she appeared in a number of classic films, including Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. Over the next several years, she would also perform for the troops in the Second World War, fall in love with and marry a white composer and arranger, undertake an international tour, and become one of the most popular nightclub performers of the post-war era. But the racism of segregation-era America would also shape and limit the career of the woman known as ‘the first Black pin-up girl’, eventually leading her to the civil rights movement and Black activism in the 1960s. This episode traces Lena’s journey from young dancer to Hollywood star and renowned vocalist, along the way exploring her connections with figures including Billie Holliday and Martin Luther King Jr., and the injustice she spent so much of her career fighting against.

Experimenting with LLMs is easy. Running them reliably and cost-effectively in production is where things break. Most AI teams never make it past demos and proofs of concept. A smaller group is pushing real workloads to production—and running into very real challenges around infrastructure efficiency, runaway cloud costs, and reliability at scale.This session is for engineers and platform teams moving beyond experimentation and building AI systems that actually hold up in production.Ioana is a Senior Product Manager at CAST AI, leading the AI Enabler product, an AI Gateway platform for cost-effective LLM infrastructure deployment. She brings 12 years of experience building B2C and B2B products reaching over 10 million users. Outside of work, she enjoys assembling puzzles and LEGOs and watching motorsports.Igor is a founding Machine Learning Engineer at CAST AI’s AI Enabler, where he focuses on optimizing inference and training at scale. With a strong background in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recommender Systems, Igor has been tackling the challenges of large-scale model optimization long before transformers became mainstream. Prior to CAST AI, he worked at industry leaders like Bloomreach and Infobip, where he contributed to the development and deployment of large-scale AI and personalization systems from the early days of the field.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Michel Bitbol - How Does Philosophy Illuminate the Physical World?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__qtHFE7JH0</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/__qtHFE7JH0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow Closer To Truth on Instagram for daily videos, updates, and announcements: https://www.instagram.com/closertotruth/

We think we understand the physical world but we do not. For example, some features of the world are derived from others, which makes the latter more fundamental and the former less so. Some scientists believe that only science can tell us how things work. Philosophers do not agree. Do philosophers see things that scientists cannot?

It is one of the most sophisticated and opaque censorship systems on the planet, and it shapes how over a billion people interact with the global internet, influences the design of privacy and proxy tools worldwide, and continues to evolve in ways that challenge researchers, developers, and policymakers alike.Jackson Sippe is a PhD researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder whose work focuses on uncovering how national-scale censorship systems operate. Jackson recently helped lead a groundbreaking study analyzing a previously undocumented GFW technique that quietly broke fully encrypted proxy protocols across China for more than a year.In this episode, Jackson joins Gregor Vand to discuss how the Great Firewall works at a technical level, the 2021–2023 blocking event, the popcount-based detection algorithm his team reverse-engineered, the cat-and-mouse ecosystem of censorship circumvention, and what these findings mean for the future of the open internet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Peasants&apos; Revolt</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-peasants-revolt</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/698b4dd4ba80cf1ecbffe5d7/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=-q71cdu26pcPTKMseYeRIROBH970ohAhd6HodjwyMtA" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1381, after plague, famine and war had pushed England to the brink, a final blow sparked an extraordinary uprising.
