Panpsychism is the theory that consciousness is irreducible and exists fundamentally at the foundations of reality. Panpsychism forms include ‘micropsychism,’ where fundamental particles or fields are in some sense conscious, and ‘Cosmopsychism,’ where the entire universe is in some sense conscious. What are the arguments for and against Panpsychism like the ‘combination problem’?

What does it mean for God to be perfect? Perfectly knowledgeable? Perfectly powerful? Perfectly good? Perfectly free? Did God create the ‘perfect world’? That’d be hard to believe. Must God, in order to be God, be the greatest conceivable Being? Is there a difference between what is conceivable and what is possible, especially for God?

Speaker(s): Karan Jagtiani

---

This session is a practical, demo-driven walkthrough of how I being a cloud architect use an open source AI copilot called Skyflo.ai to speed up day-to-day DevOps and SRE workflows, without sacrificing safety or compliance. We'll dive into a real incident in a live Kubernetes environment with a Jenkins deployment, where the audience will see the AI agent in action, and how I prompt the agent to triage the incident, decide on the next steps, and act on it. Attendees will see how teams are cutting incident response time by utilizing Skyflo and it's human-in-the-loop approach.

Key Takeaways:

    Learn how I cut down incident response time by 50% at Storylane by using an AI copilot
    See how to use an AI copilot to speed up your Kubernetes, Argo, Helm, and Jenkins workflows
    Understand the human-in-the-loop architecture of Skyflo and behind the scenes of how it works


Live Demo Plan (70% time):
1) Trigger a deployment on Jenkins using Skyflo
2) Wait for the agent to report back with the status of the deployment
3) The pipeline will succeed, but the deployment in Kubernetes will fail
4) The agent will go through a process of discovery to find the root cause of the issue
5) The agent will decide on the next steps and act on it

Under-the-Hood (30% time):

    Brief Architecture Tour: How LangGraph and MCP are used to power the Skyflo agent
    Custom MCP Server: kubectl/helm/argo/jenkins with typed parameters and validation
    Streaming over SSE: Live events over Redis pub/sub and server-sent events over MCP

Born into a middle class Black family in New York, a young Lena Horne soon followed in the footsteps of her actress mother and made her début at the famous Cotton Club aged only 16. After making her name as a singer and performer – and following the end of her tumultuous first marriage – Horne transferred to the west coast and bagged a Hollywood contract with MGM. There, she appeared in a number of classic films, including Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. Over the next several years, she would also perform for the troops in the Second World War, fall in love with and marry a white composer and arranger, undertake an international tour, and become one of the most popular nightclub performers of the post-war era. But the racism of segregation-era America would also shape and limit the career of the woman known as ‘the first Black pin-up girl’, eventually leading her to the civil rights movement and Black activism in the 1960s. This episode traces Lena’s journey from young dancer to Hollywood star and renowned vocalist, along the way exploring her connections with figures including Billie Holliday and Martin Luther King Jr., and the injustice she spent so much of her career fighting against. 
 
If you’re a fan of the history of cinema, mid-century America, and Black cultural icons, you’ll love our episode on Lena Horne.
 
If you want more musical icons with Desiree Burch, listen to our episodes on Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, and Broadway Musicals. And for more film history, check out our episodes on the history of Bollywood and Sarah Bernhardt.

We think we understand the physical world but we do not. For example, some features of the world are derived from others, which makes the latter more fundamental and the former less so. Some scientists believe that only science can tell us how things work. Philosophers do not agree. Do philosophers see things that scientists cannot?

Speaker(s): Ayushi Midha, Aishwarya Urne

---
In the world of digital accessibility, silence is seldom neutral. For users of screen readers, a missing announcement can mean confusion, distrust, or exclusion—yet the issue often remains invisible to most developers and designers. In this talk, we’ll explore how the absence of spoken feedback impacts accessibility, trust, and user experience, particularly for people navigating dynamic web interfaces. Drawing on real-world examples and practical scenarios, we’ll examine the root causes of “silent failures” (such as missing ARIA live regions, improper roles, stale live-region content) and discuss how seemingly minor markup decisions ripple into major accessibility barriers. Attendees will walk away with a clear framework for diagnosing and remedying these silent gaps: from audit strategies and end-user testing through to implementable code patterns, best practices for dynamic announcements, and how to integrate these into your UI/component library workflow. Whether you’re working in React, Web Components, or template-driven apps, you’ll gain actionable insights to ensure your components announce properly, your users feel heard, and your silent UI becomes truly inclusive.

**Key take-aways:**

Why missing announcements matter: the user-experience impact beyond visual cues

Common pitfalls in dynamic content, live regions, and state changes

A developer-friendly approach to audit, test, and fix announcement gaps

How to bake these practices into your component library or design system (for example, your team’s work with PatternFly and a custom theme)

Tips for collaboration between developers, UX designers, and accessibility testers to maintain accessibility as your product evolves

Feature engineering is eating your training time. Data loading is your bottleneck. Sound familiar?
If your training jobs crawl, your features take forever to compute, or your pipeline breaks every time you scale, this talk is for you.

In this session, we’ll show how to turn a slow, file-based ML pipeline into a distributed, production-ready architecture using modern open-source tooling:
- Feast for feature management
- Ray for distributed data processing
- Kubeflow Training Operator for orchestrating distributed training on Kubernetes

We’ll demonstrate an end-to-end pipeline, powering a Temporal Fusion Transformer trained on 421K rows of Walmart sales data. Using PyTorch DDP across multiple GPUs, how we can cut training time, while hitting 10.5% MAPE (compared to the typical 15–20% industry baseline).

You’ll see:
- Faster feature loading using Ray + Feast
- Raw data flowing through a fully managed feature platform
- Distributed PyTorch jobs launched and scaled with Kubeflow Training Operator
- Production inference path powered by Feast’s hybrid storage & compute
- How Ray transforms feature engineering performance at scale
- How Feast standardizes feature computation across training & inference

You’ll leave with a repeatable blueprint for building ML pipelines that scale as your models, data, and teams grow, along with the confidence to adopt these tools in your own production environment.

Speaker(s): Mansi Agarwal

---

The world of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and modern deep learning share a core DNA: the demand for near-linear scaling across hundreds of nodes. The core challenges remain the same—managing communication, balancing load, and coordinating resources but the abstractions and tooling are now defined by PyTorch Distributed.

This talk bridges the gap between traditional HPC paradigms and PyTorch's distributed computing ecosystem, designed specifically for deep learning workloads. We'll explore how familiar HPC concepts like collective operations, point-to-point communication, and process groups, manifest in PyTorch's distributed APIs. We'll discover how PyTorch builds upon battle-tested communication backends (NCCL, Gloo, MPI) while introducing novel primitives optimized for gradient synchronization and model parallelism. We then move beyond basic data parallelism to explore advanced memory-saving techniques like Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), PyTorch's native answer to memory scaling and touch upon the nascent Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism APIs, demonstrating how these techniques compose to train massive models.

This session equips you with a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch's distributed architecture and reveals the inner workings of one of the most actively developed areas in modern ML infrastructure. By mapping distributed systems concepts to PyTorch's implementation, you'll see how familiar patterns from parallel computing manifest in PyTorch's ecosystem and where there is still room for innovation and improvement.

Speaker(s): Sagar Sundaray, Vinod Pathangay

---
Accurate prediction of the battery range of electric vehicles requires periodic update of the prediction model as there are changes in battery parameters with time and variation in driving dynamics. Federated Learning (FL) offers the following two advantages for model update: (1) It aggregates learnings from data patterns of fleet of vehicles to provide a sophisticated model that has been trained on wide range of scenarios. (2) It protects the privacy of the vehicle user without sending raw data to the central repository for model updates. With simulated vehicle data and Flower FL framework, a range prediction solution has been developed in a manner so as to easily port to an embedded edge Texas Instruments platform. The edge component can run as a quality managed (QM) component where as the central model aggregation can run as a containerized application on-prem or cloud where communication is established using gRPC.

We have all seen it. Your GitOps tool reports Synced in seconds, but your edge node pods are stuck in ContainerCreating/ImagePullBackOff for minutes... hours. This is not just a low bandwidth problem. it is a fundamental design flaw. We are trying to apply a centralized, cloud-native architecture to a decentralized, distributed-systems problem.

This leads to slow startups, failed updates even worse pullSecrets on every node create a massive security risk. In this session with Harbor Satellite (subproject of goharbor) we will run a stateless distributed registry along with your container workloads

Speaker(s): Dr. Rahul Gaikwad

---
Infrastructure as Code has standardized Day-0 provisioning, but most enterprises still handle Day-2 operations patching, configuration changes, drift remediation, and incident response through manual processes and fragmented automation. This session shows how Terraform Actions, combined with the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), transforms Terraform from a provisioning tool into an operational control plane. With Terraform managing infrastructure state and Ansible executing configuration and remediation workflows, teams can unify provisioning and operations into a single, governed workflow. Using the new Terraform action for AAP, a single terraform apply can trigger Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) to execute dynamic automation across Red Hat environments. The result is a repeatable, policy-driven model for Day-2 operations that reduces operational friction, eliminates ad-hoc access, and improves reliability at scale.

If God exists outside of time—not in time, but timeless and eternal—what would that mean about God’s nature? God would never ‘lose’ the past or anticipate the future. God would not need to know the future, because to a timeless God, there would be no future. Everything would be ever-present in one timeless moment. But how could a timeless God relate to human beings?

In this talk, Rahul Raja explores how dense retrieval, vector databases, and hybrid search systems are redefining how modern AI retrieves, ranks, and reasons over information. He discusses how retrieval now powers large language models through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the new MLOps challenges that arise, embedding drift, continuous evaluation, and large-scale vector maintenance.Looking ahead, the session envisions a future of Cognitive Search, where retrieval systems move beyond recall to genuine reasoning, contextual understanding, and multimodal awareness. Listeners will gain insight into how the next generation of retrieval will bridge semantics, scalability, and intelligence, powering everything from search and recommendations to generative AI.// BioRahul is a Staff Engineer at LinkedIn, where he focuses on search and deployment systems at scale. Rahul is a graduate from Carnegie Mellon University and has a strong background in building reliable, high-performance infrastructure. He has led many initiatives to improve search relevance and streamline ML deployment workflows.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] Vector Search for Media[00:33] RAG and Search Evolution[04:45] Cognitive vs Semantic Search[08:26] High Value Search Signals[16:43] Scaling with Embeddings[22:37] BM25 Benchmark Bias[29:00] Video Search Use Cases[31:21] Context and Search Tradeoff[35:04] Personal Memory Augmentation[39:03] Future of Cognitive Search[44:51] Access Control in Vectors[49:14] Search Ranking Challenge[54:43] Hard Search Problems Solved[58:29] Freshness vs Cost]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Optimizing Agent Behavior in Production with Gideon Mendels</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2026/02/17/optimizing-agent-behavior-in-production-with-gideon-mendels/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=optimizing-agent-behavior-in-production-with-gideon-mendels</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED9081665534.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:00:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LLM -powered systems continue to move steadily into production, but this process is presenting teams with challenges that traditional software practices don’t commonly encounter. Models and agents are non-deterministic systems, which makes it difficult to test changes, reason about failures, and confidently ship updates. This has created the need for new evaluation tooling designed specifically around the properties of LLMs.Comet is a platform with Roots and MLOps, to the rapidly evolving world of agent-based systems by treating prompts, tools, and workflows as optimizable components that can be evaluated and improved over time.Gideon Mendels is the co -founder and CEO of Comet. He previously worked at Google on hate speech and deception detection, and he founded GroupWise, which trained and deployed NLP models processing billions of chats. In this episode, Gideon joins Kevin Ball to discuss how agent development sits between software engineering and ML, why eVals are the missing foundation for most AI teams, prompt optimization as a search problem, and the future for continuously improving agents in production.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Comet.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>All the Claw things (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/181</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://pscrb.fm/rss/p/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/181/changelog-news-181.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI, ZeroClaw is “claw done right”, MimiClaw runs on a $5 chip, Steve Yegge on managing the AI Vampire, and the day the telnet died.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Panpsychism is the theory that consciousness is irreducible and exists fundamentally at the foundations of reality. Panpsychism forms include ‘micropsychism,’ where fundamental particles or fields are in some sense conscious, and ‘Cosmopsychism,’ where the entire universe is in some sense conscious. What are the arguments for and against Panpsychism like the ‘combination problem’?
