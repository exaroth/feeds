Science can deal with God in at least three ways: showing how God is not necessary; showing how God is likely; not relating to God at all. Is only one way best? Atheists claim that scientific explanation eliminates for a ‘God of the gaps’. Theists point to the beauty of mathematics and the cosmos all resulting in human sentience and experience.

When philosophy focuses on religion its targets cover the field: proofs of God’s existence, traits and attributes of God, human essence and purpose, religious experiences, faith and belief, diverse and conflicting religions, science and religion, miracles and revelation, and the like. What can religion learn from philosophy? Can philosophy approach God?

Also known as the American Revolutionary War, 2025 marks 250 years since the start of the conflict in 1775, when the first battles between the British army and the colonial resistance were fought at Lexington and Concord. But what caused Britain’s North American colonies to rebel against the king and government in London? At what point did they start to see themselves as American and not British? And how did a colonial militia take on an imperial superpower?This episode charts the growing rift between Britain and its American colonists, taking in famous events like the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party and the calling of the first Continental Congress, all the way through to the Declaration of Independence and the course of the revolutionary war itself. We learn how America fought to free itself from the shackles of British rule, and meet some well-known names from history, including Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin and George Washington. And we also ask whose freedom was being fought for, and who – such as Black and Indigenous Americans – got left behind.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

If so, you may have heard of the ancient tradition of keening or the superstition of the 'hungry grass'. In this episode, Dan is joined by the hosts of the After Dark podcast, Dr Anthony Delaney and Dr Maddy Pelling, to explore some of the historic rites and beliefs surrounding death and mourning in Ireland. Anthony explains the role of 'keening women' - once persecuted by the government and the church - who would wail and lament at the graveside (and air any mistakes the deceased may have made) as well as the procession down the 'corpse road' and the customs of covering mirrors and opening the window at the point of death.Warning: this episode has an instance of explicit language.Produced by Freddy Chick and edited by Matthew Wilson and Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spartacus and Gladiators, with Mary Beard</title><link></link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/A27C8C/traffic.megaphone.fm/GLT6726080326.mp3?updated=1761845796" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://therestishistory.com/">The Rest is History</source></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2403 - Andrew Gallimore</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErO3RuGTXE</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IErO3RuGTXE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

What actually happens in the brain during a near-death experience? Neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin shares groundbreaking research that reveals dramatic surges in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the moments before death. These chemical floods may explain the feelings of euphoria, tunnels of light, and out-of-body sensations reported by millions. Is this evidence of the afterlife—or proof that the dying brain creates its own final visions?

Idealism is the theory that all reality is consciousness and only consciousness, and that what we perceive to be the physical world is either a manifestation of consciousness or derived from it. Either way, fundamental reality is pure consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Idealism (like the common sense of the physical)?

It’s an idea that runs counter to the materialist worldview we’re all taught in school. But the outer edges of scientific inquiry bleed into what can only be called ‘magic.’ With a uniquely science-backed approach, parapsychologist Dean Radin explores the "magical" elements of consciousness including telepathy, spell casting, conjuring spirits, and more.

Radin's book, "The Science of Magic: How the Mind Weaves the Fabric of Reality", is on sale now: https://amzn.to/3KXvPd7

Dean Radin is an American parapsychologist. Following a bachelor and master's degree in electrical engineering and a PhD in educational psychology Radin worked at Bell Labs, as a researcher at Princeton University and the University of Edinburgh, and was a faculty member at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
