Corey Zumar, Jules Damji, and Danny Chiao break down how MLflow is being rebuilt for GenAI, agents, and real production systems where evals are messy, memory is risky, and governance actually matters.

In 218 BCE, the Second Punic War began between the two powers, with the Carthaginian army led by a man named Hannibal Barca. Famously, Hannibal took his forces – including a contingent of war elephants – over the Alps and into Italy, finally marching on Rome itself. But eventually the Carthaginians were beaten back, and Hannibal ended his days in exile. In this episode we explore his epic life, from his childhood in Spain, to his tactical brilliance as a general, to his post-war career as a reformist politician.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Why do people believe the things they do? We like to think that we are rational, that what we believe is true. But often we come to our beliefs, unknowingly, as a product of our particular ‘belief systems’. How do belief systems work their credulous magic? What principles enable belief systems to influence individuals and commandeer groups?

What would it mean for God to have a ‘nature’? A nature is a deep essence that defines a particular way of being. Would God’s nature characterize, limit or even control God? Could contradictions among aspects of God’s supposed nature emerge that might deny God? Can we know anything of what such an ineffable supreme being might be like?

Across the United States, police departments are deploying automated license plate readers, facial recognition tools, and predictive systems that quietly log the daily movements of millions of people. These tools promise efficiency and safety, but critics argue that they represent a form of warrantless mass surveillance, and raise deep constitutional questions about privacy, accountability, and the limits of government power in the digital age.Michael Soyfer is an attorney at the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm focused on defending individual rights.

What’s the relationship between our brains and our consciousness, between the physical stuff in our skulls and the mental experiences in our minds? Much rides on the answer. Are human beings purely physical? Evolved at random and destined to die, extinguished forever? Or are we something more? A spirit or a soul, with existence beyond?

Panpsychism forms include ‘micropsychism,’ where fundamental particles or fields are in some sense conscious, and ‘Cosmopsychism,’ where the entire universe is in some sense conscious. What are the arguments for and against Panpsychism like the ‘combination problem’?

Our capacity, as conscious subjects, to make things explicit, so that what-is presents itself as “that-it-is” or “that-it-is-the-case” is at the heart of the mystery of human being. Philosopher Raymond Tallis explores how explicitness connects with fundamental ontological, metaphysical, and epistemological questions.

Tallis' latest book, "Circling Round Explicitness: The Heart of the Mystery of Human Being", is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/3MUX5Ke

Raymond Tallis trained in medicine at Oxford University and at St Thomas’ Hospital London before becoming Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Manchester. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences for his research in clinical neuroscience. He retired from medicine in 2006 to become a full-time writer. His books have ranged across many subjects—from philosophical anthropology to literary and cultural criticism—but all are characterized by a fascination for the infinite complexity of human lives and the human condition. The Economist’s Intelligent Life magazine lists him as one of the world’s leading polymaths.

Teams work across different operating systems, chip architectures, and cloud environments, each with its own dependency quirks and version mismatches. Ensuring that code runs reproducibly across these environments has become a major challenge that’s made even harder by growing concerns around software supply chain security.Nix is a powerful open-source package manager that builds software in controlled, declarative environments where dependencies are explicitly defined and reproducible. Its functional approach has made it a gold standard for reproducible builds, but it can also be difficult to learn and adopt.Flox is a company that builds on top of Nix, with increased supply chain security and abstractions that streamline the developer experience.Michael Stahnke is the VP of Engineering at Flox and formerly worked at companies including Caterpillar, Puppet, and CircleCI. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to talk about Flox, building on top of Nix, how reproducibility underpins software security, the concept of “secure by construction, how deterministic environments are reshaping both human and AI-driven development, and much more.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Flox.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A history of (American) occupation in Greenland</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/a-history-of-american-occupation-in-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/695eba9da32e86d77589ca57/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=J2ZAaDgkPpy3ySxaqDaYN8HdvpKKUc2a2huBvPcfW6M" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jan 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This isn't the first or even second time the U.S has made moves to procure Greenland in the last 160 years. President Donald Trump has stepped up his rhetoric, now saying that the use of US military is ‘always an option’ to annexe the autonomous territory. Currently part of the Kingdom of Denmark, an American takeover of Greenland would pose a serious crisis for NATO. But how much authority does Denmark have to protect Greenland? Why does Trump want it, and why are there already American troops  stationed there?In this episode, first released in January 2025, Dan and Professor Robert Rix from the University of Copenhagen trace the occupation of Greenland from the first Vikings to the arrival of the Americans in the mid-20th century, as well as explain its relationship with Denmark and explore previous attempts from American administrations to acquire it.You can discover more about the history of Greenland in Robert's book 'The Vanished Settlers of Greenland: In Search of a Legend and Its Legacy'. Produced by James Hickmann, Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fall of Sparta</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/the-ancients/episodes/fall-of-sparta</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/the-ancients/e/694434bc9a00ace34fdb33e8/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Vt6IfeuKd0trTyLiFJHtFuvPrZ0zWR6xu82yhmDr82Y" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jan 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/">Podcast - Ancients</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How did Sparta, the most feared military state in ancient Greece, fall from grace in a single generation?In this episode of , Tristan Hughes is joined by Dr Roel Konijnendijk and Dr Owen Rees to chronicle Sparta's catastrophic collapse in the fourth century BC. Fresh from its victory over Athens in the year 404, Sparta stood unrivalled. Yet within decades, its power would be shattered, its authority broken, and its golden age over. From decisive battles against resurgent rivals Thebes and Corinth to over-ambitious kings and a defining clash with a warband of sacred lovers, it is a gripping story of sky-high stakes and two-faced duplicity; of brutal power struggles and the cut-throat scramble to become the hegemonic power of ancient Greece.Sparta vs Athens: The Greek World WarPresented by Tristan Hughes.

Given the myriad theories of consciousness on offer, how can they be assessed? What criteria should we use to compare and contrast diverse theories? Evaluating Materialism theories, like seeking neural correlates of consciousness, use the scientific method. But what about theories that are not Materialism?

There are so many arguments for and against the existence of God. Most we have heard over and over again, without common resolution. Are there new or novel arguments worth considering? Different arguments may expand our way of thinking about God, and that alone is useful.
