Tools like npm and Yarn have long been the core of the JavaScript ecosystem, enabling developers to install, update, and share code with ease. But as projects grow larger and the ecosystem more complex, this older infrastructure is beginning to show its limits with performance bottlenecks, dependency conflicts, and growing concerns around supply chain security.Darcy Clarke and Ruy Adorno are veterans of this ecosystem. Both spent years maintaining the npm CLI and helping guide the Node.js project, where they saw firsthand the technical debt and design tradeoffs that define modern JavaScript tooling. Now they’re building vlt, a new package manager and registry that rethinks performance, security, and developer experience from the ground up.In this episode, Darcy and Ruy join Josh Goldberg to discuss how vlt works, why they believe package management needs a server-side reboot, what lessons they’ve drawn from npm’s evolution, and how features like declarative querying, self-hosted registries, and real-time security scanning could reshape how developers build and share JavaScript in the years ahead.Josh Goldberg is an independent full time open source developer in the TypeScript ecosystem. He works on projects that help developers write better TypeScript more easily, most notably on typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. Josh regularly contributes to open source projects in the ecosystem such as ESLint and TypeScript. Josh is a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies and the author of the acclaimed Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly), a cherished resource for any developer seeking to learn TypeScript without any prior experience outside of JavaScript. Josh regularly presents talks and workshops at bootcamps, conferences, and meetups to share knowledge on TypeScript, static analysis, open source, and general frontend and web development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Battle of Bosworth</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-battle-of-bosworth</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/696fabab6544003fe9f1daca/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=ODHju9sCLrviO1DDK1RyfjogFbFrH8-mjgQrdRsMn7c" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In August 1485, the would-be king Henry Tudor went head-to-head with King Richard III - the final, decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses.

This talk introduces an approach to AI infrastructure optimization through universal resource management that reshapes applications to run efficiently on any available hardware—CPUs, GPUs, or accelerators.We explore how code reshaping technology can unlock the untapped potential of enterprise computing infrastructure, enabling organizations to serve 2-3x more workloads while dramatically reducing dependency on scarce GPU resources. The presentation demonstrates why CPUs often outperform GPUs for memory-intensive AI workloads, offering superior cost-effectiveness and immediate availability without architectural complexity.// BioWilder Lopes is a second-time founder, developer, and research engineer focused on building practical infrastructure for developers. He is currently building Ogre.run, an AI agent designed to solve code reproducibility.Ogre enables developers to package source code into fully reproducible environments in seconds. Unlike traditional tools that require extensive manual setup, Ogre uses AI to analyze codebases and automatically generate the artifacts needed to make code run reliably on any machine. The result is faster development workflows and applications that work out of the box, anywhere.// Related LinksWebsite: https://ogre.runhttps://lopes.aihttps://substack.com/@wilderlopeshttps://youtu.be/YCWkUub5x8c?si=7RPKqRhu0Uf9LTql]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2441 - Paul Rosolie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoFniMSMj08</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EoFniMSMj08?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:00:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Paul Rosolie is a conservationist, filmmaker, author, and founder of Junglekeepers.

Theists who believe in God and avoid the problem of evil delude themselves. If there is a God, evil is God’s hardest problem to explain. If there is no God, evil is the easiest evidence supporting a lack of God. Theologians have no tougher task than explaining evil’s enormity. They have devised clever, even profound, explanations and justifications. Do they pass the smell test?

Some think metaphysics is ancient nonsense; others that it’s the bizarre occult. How does modern metaphysics contribute to our understanding of the world? It asks the most profound questions: what kinds of things exist? How does causality work? Sound too abstract? How about: does God exist? Are you a soul?

Why are ‘belief systems’ so powerful? How do they control religion and politics and all ways of thinking from a scientific worldview to conspiracy theories? What is a ‘belief system’? It is a set of tenets or convictions that support each other, such that the whole system governs individual beliefs. How we believe may be more important than what we believe.

Corey Zumar, Jules Damji, and Danny Chiao break down how MLflow is being rebuilt for GenAI, agents, and real production systems where evals are messy, memory is risky, and governance actually matters.

In 218 BCE, the Second Punic War began between the two powers, with the Carthaginian army led by a man named Hannibal Barca. Famously, Hannibal took his forces – including a contingent of war elephants – over the Alps and into Italy, finally marching on Rome itself. But eventually the Carthaginians were beaten back, and Hannibal ended his days in exile. In this episode we explore his epic life, from his childhood in Spain, to his tactical brilliance as a general, to his post-war career as a reformist politician.This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Why do people believe the things they do? We like to think that we are rational, that what we believe is true. But often we come to our beliefs, unknowingly, as a product of our particular ‘belief systems’. How do belief systems work their credulous magic? What principles enable belief systems to influence individuals and commandeer groups?

What would it mean for God to have a ‘nature’? A nature is a deep essence that defines a particular way of being. Would God’s nature characterize, limit or even control God? Could contradictions among aspects of God’s supposed nature emerge that might deny God? Can we know anything of what such an ineffable supreme being might be like?

What’s the relationship between our brains and our consciousness, between the physical stuff in our skulls and the mental experiences in our minds? Much rides on the answer. Are human beings purely physical? Evolved at random and destined to die, extinguished forever? Or are we something more? A spirit or a soul, with existence beyond?

Bush during the Cold War. America has a long history of using formal, informal, military and economic power to influence and exert control in its neighbouring countries and beyond. Dan is joined by Professor Daniel Immerwahr, historian and author of How to Hide an Empire: The Greater United States, to explore the ways in which America has shaped the political landscape in the western hemisphere for two centuries. They examine the parallels and differences of historic interventions like the 1954 coup in Guatemala and the 1989 invasion of Panama with the events of today.Produced by Mariana Des Forges, edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>634.
