Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, Donald Trump said he had an “amazing” meeting with Xi Jinping in South Korea. The US reduced its tariffs on fentanyl to 10% immediately, and reached a deal on soybeans and agriculture. The US president said he’d discussed Nvidia chips, but that it’s up to Beijing to continue talking to the company about access to China. He plans to visit China in April. Xi said China will cooperate with the US.

A rate cut from the Fed, but a warning from chair Jay Powell there's no guarantee of another reduction in December. The Bank of Japan holds steady, while the ECB prepares to deliver its decision later today. Meanwhile, Meta and Microsoft shares have fallen in afterhours trading after the tech giants disclosed huge AI spending plans in their latest earnings reports.

Today's guests: ABN Amro Bank Senior Economist Jan-Paul van de Kerke, Diego Di Giorgi, CFO of Standard Chartered & Ana Boata, Head of Economic Research at Allianz Trade

That's according to the public defender's office. Four of the dead were police officers. Backed by armored vehicles, helicopters and drones, thousands of heavily-armed police raided the strongholds of a major organized crime gang in some of Rio's poorest neighborhoods. Residents spent the night recovering the dead. The UN's human rights body says it is 'horrified' by the number of casualties and has called for an investigation.

And it's got aeroplane pilots relying more on their training to fly and land their aircaft. A report cited by Swedish public television said that the first four months of this year saw around 123,000 incidents of GPS jamming and other disruptions affecting flights in the region.  

One of the disrupted flights was carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In August, she was on a tour of countries bordering Russia, Belarus and the Black Sea, when interference jammed the plane's GPS system.  
 
The pilot circled for an hour and resorted to using paper maps before landing safely in Bulgaria. Bulgaria pointed the finger at Russia, and the EU Commission followed suit.

President Trump is sending America's largest aircraft carrier to help stop the small boats that he says are transporting drugs to the US. His administration says 57 people have been killed in US strikes on these alleged drug boats. On Wednesday, he said US forces had "almost completely" stopped the drugs coming into America by sea. 

Speculation is therefore growing about what the USS Gerald R Ford's mission in the Caribbean could be. Donald Trump says he hasn't ruled out strikes on land-based targets in Venezuela. He says the US is in "armed conflict" with the cartels there. But Venezuela has accused the American president of using drug trafficking claims to "fabricate a war" in Latin America.

Exit polls show a shift to the left, with the center-left D66 party projected to take the most seats in parliament – around 18 more than in the last election two years ago. Geert Wilder's far-right Freedom party appears to have taken a beating. Last time, they won the highest number of seats. But the first exit poll shows them in second, having lost around 12 seats. The vote was seen as a test of Wilder's popularity after his party walked out of the coalition government, causing its collapse.

Massad Boulos happens to have a personal connection; as his son is married to the president’s daughter, Tiffany Trump.The second is that the Arab countries who have become key players in trying to resolve this conflict have strong ties to the US, and Trump has been working on strengthening those ties.“The US was part of the ‘Quad’ of countries that put forward a path to peace in September, but neither of the two armed groups involved in the actual fighting signed up.”And the third – according to Boswell – is that his ongoing desire to secure a Nobel Peace Prize is making him turn to those conflicts that previously would not have been high up the US’ strategic interests.After overseeing Cambodia and Thailand signing an agreement (he said peace deal, though the Thai foreign minister would not go beyond a possible path to peace) the Cambodian Prime Minister said he would nominate Trump himself.So, could he be tempted to put more effort into Sudan? Things don’t appear hugely hopeful at the moment.“After all, President Trump isn’t only in this for a prize – the reality is that, in many of these conflicts, there is potential economic gain for the US.”The US was part of the ‘Quad’ of countries (including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates) that put forward a path to peace in September, but neither of the two armed groups involved in the actual fighting (the SAF and RSF) signed up – and have since either rejected or ignored the plan.Fresh hope with meetings scheduledSince then, the US has tried again, convening a meeting on Friday including the Sudanese Foreign Minister, and trying to push towards a three month humanitarian pause.And on that, the armed groups have at least engaged.That is why – despite recent scenes – Boswell says he does not think things are hopeless.But he also admits that the same figures who are wondering how to gain Trump’s attention are also “hyperaware that the attention might not last long.”After all, President Trump isn’t only in this for a prize – the reality is that, in many of these conflicts, there is potential economic gain for the US.A satellite photo provided by Planet Labs PBC, showing the area around the headquarters of the Sudanese military’s 6th Division in El-Fasher, Sudan, on October 26.Take another African conflict – between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, where Trump may claim peace but the reality on the ground tells a different story.Any aftermath there could pave the way for lucrative mining deals that the US could benefit from.A worry for those linked to the Sudanese conflict, who believe that Trump’s interest could shift the dial, fear there may not be enough to gain economically in Sudan, to hold this US President’s glare.As Donald Trump continues his Asia tour, all eyes are on his upcoming meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday – amid a fierce trade war and fraught geopolitical backdrop.In this week’s episode of our TrumpWorld podcast, Anushka Asthana and Matt Frei break down what we can expect from this meeting and what’s at stake; from trade deals to tech tensions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What are the nuclear capabilities of Russia&apos;s Burevestnik missile?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2-jbEKrDJpg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2-jbEKrDJpg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:26:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia says it’s built a missile that can fly for days — powered by a mini nuclear reactor. It’s called Burevestnik, or “Storm Petrel” — and it’s meant to outsmart any defense system. But how real is that claim, and what could it mean for the war in Ukraine or for global security?
Russian President Vladimir Putin had already announced the development of the “Burevestnik” cruise missiles in 2018. A video from 2018 remains one of the few visual records of the Burevestnik to this day.

In July, Trump had agreed to cut tariffs on South Korean imports to 15 % — that was in return for $350 billion dollars investment from Seoul — despite worries from Korean officials that it could destabilize their own economy.

Though widespread power outages across the island are hampering recovery efforts.Desmond McKenzie, the Jamaican Minister of Local Government said that “Jamaica’s gone through what I can call one of its worst periods.”He added: “Our infrastructure has been severely compromised. St Elizabeth is the breadbasket of the country, and that has taken a beating.”The parish of St Elizabeth in the south east is one of the worst-hit areas. The coastal district is described as being ‘under water’ by officials, with power lines leaning precariously over flooded, debris-filled streets – making access for responders difficult.The Jamaican capital of Kingston, in the east of the island, was spared the eye of the storm but has still suffered significant damage.The number of fatalities has not yet been released by the government, but “we are expecting that there would be some loss of life,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told CNN.Help is on the way with aid agencies and foreign governments on standby to support this nation of almost 3 million people, according to Richard Thompson from the Jamaican Disaster Preparedness co-ordinating Body, ODPEM.“We will have a lot of commitment coming from overseas,” he said.“We will have enough hands on board and a very well put together plan to ensure when supplies are in the country that they are not backing up at the ports.”But Melissa’s trail of destruction is not over yet.It was downgraded to a category 3 hurricane as it made landfall in Cuba on Wednesday morning. But it is still the strongest hurricane to hit the island since 2017 – with sustained wind speeds of 120mph.More than 700,000 Cubans were evacuated  and local authorities have declared a “state of alert” in six eastern provinces.Residents now fear what might unfold over the coming hours.“You’re looking at the sea as it is right now. We’ve had to move things from the house to higher ground. We’re sheltering the animals to prevent them from drowning in case the tide rises and the water comes in,” resident Reinaldo Montoya told reporters.Meanwhile, Cuba’s President appeared on state TV to warn people of the damage to come.“We want to stress again how big this event is and the need for people to understand the risk it poses because of its scale,” said President Migel Diaz-Canel.“We want to stress again how big this event is and the need for people to understand the risk it poses because of its scale,”– Cuban President Migel Diaz-Canel“These winds can destroy any facility that is not properly prepared. So we are once again asking everyone to use the time left before the hurricane arrives to move to safe areas to face this hurricane.”This hermit nation had already been experiencing a severe economic crisis with widespread food shortages and regular power outages, worsened by US sanctions and a lack of foreign currency.Soldiers have been deployed to the affected regions, but recovery from this storm will be made all the more challenging without the kind of outside help Jamaica will receive.Neighbouring Haiti is also experiencing the peripheral effects of Melissa, with heavy rainfall and flooding reported. Authorities ordered the closure of schools and businesses on Wednesday, while the UN said it will provide assistance in the coming days.The storm is now expected to lose power as it crosses towards Bermuda and the Bahamas before heading off into the Atlantic.And a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture meaning storms can produce heavier rainfall and flooding.Sea level rises are also making coastal communities more vulnerable to storm surges.The UN is again issuing warnings over climate change ahead of COP30 in Brazil next month. Only 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon despite being required to do so for the summit.Added together, these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C , a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change.While the UN does say progress in cutting carbon emissions over the next decade is being made, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target.For people in the Caribbean that could mean hurricanes more regularly as strong as Melissa, blighting the lives of residents and putting off visitors critical to their largely tourism based economies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kazakhstan bets on AI: Building unicorns and next-gen computing infrastructure</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SLq7b_at70</link><author>euronews</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-SLq7b_at70?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:26:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrZ3UV4jOidv8ppoVuvW9Q">News - Euronews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kazakhstan bets on AI: Building unicorns and next-gen computing infrastructure
