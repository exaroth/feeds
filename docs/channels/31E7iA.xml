Trump wrote that he was no longer obliged to think of peace. A big shift for someone who has cloaked himself in the mantle of a peacemaker.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki has signed the state budget for 2026 into law despite expressing strong reservations about the government’s management of the economy.He called it a “budget of chaos”, but also acknowledged that, if he had taken the unprecedented decision not to sign the budget, it would have caused even greater uncertainty.At the same time as signing the bill, Nawrocki also referred it to the Constitutional Tribunal (TK) for assessment. However, any decision the TK makes will be ignored by the government, which regards the tribunal as illegitimate.Unlike other bills, the budget act cannot be vetoed by the president. When it was sent to Nawrocki by parliament last Tuesday, the president had one week to decide between three options.He could have simply signed the bill into law – always an unlikely choice for an opposition-aligned president who has regularly clashed with the government.The second option was to sign it into law while also sending it to the TK for assessment, as was done by Nawrocki’s predecessor, Andrzej Duda, also an opposition ally, in each of the last two years.Finally, he could have refused to sign the budget and at the same time sent it to the TK. No president has ever taken that option, and doing so would have created weeks, and possibly months, of fiscal and legal uncertainty.Last week, Nawrocki said that he still did “not know what I will do” and remained “open to every possibility”. However, on Tuesday evening, the president announced that he had opted for option number two.It means that the TK has up to two months to assess the budget and issue a ruling on its constitutionality. In the meantime, the budget goes into force as normal.Given that the TK is stacked with opposition-aligned judges, it is likely to find fault with the budget. But it will almost certainly be ignored (as it was last year) by the government, which does not recognise the TK because it contains judges unlawfully appointed by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.In a recorded speech, the president declared that the budget is “evidence of a deep crisis of credibility in the current government” and “demonstrates a helpless capitulation to the challenges facing Poland”.In particular, Nawrocki criticised its impact on the level of debt, noting that it is the second year in a row in which the deficit is equivalent to almost a third of total spending.“Poland has faced questions over its public finances in recent years. In 2024, the European Union placed Poland under its excessive deficit procedure, requiring it to take steps to bring the deficit, which stood at 6.5% of GDP that year, to below the EU target of 3%.The deficit in fact rose to an estimated 6.8% of GDP in 2025 but is now forecast to decline to 6.3% in 2026 and 6.1% in 2027, according to the European Commission.However, despite his concerns over the budget, Nawrocki said that refusing to sign it into law “would not solve any of the problems we face” but would “pose a risk to the stability and predictability of state affairs”.Finance minister Andrzej Domański has, by contrast, called the government’s spending plans “a budget for an ambitious and secure Poland”, with a focus on “investments in innovation, digitisation and the competitiveness of our economy”.In response to Nawrocki’s decision, Domański issued a brief statement: “The president has signed the budget. A budget of investments and record-high defence spending. The rest, including referring the bill to the Constitutional Tribunal, is political theatre with no real consequences. We continue working.”Poland’s defence spending, which was already at the highest relative level in NATO, will now rise further to just over 200 billion zloty (€47.4 billion), the equivalent of 4.8% of GDP, this year. The budget also devotes 249 billion zloty, 6.8% of GDP, to healthcare.

However, in a recent statement, the U.S. president said he had changed course after failing to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reiterated his desire to control Greenland. EU leaders have accused Washington of extortion for threatening to impose tariffs on countries that oppose the takeover of the semi-autonomous Danish territory. So, how did we get here? Let's take a look back at the last twelve months of Trump's deal-making—and breaking.

Trump, President of the United States of America. Weeks after attacking Venezuela, capturing its controversial leader, and reviving Greenland ambitions, the US president's presence in Davos is expected to raise the stakes at the WEF's annual meeting.

The event is taking place at a time US President Donald Trump is seeking to dismantle the international order: From upending established trade rules and mass withdrawal from international organizations, including the UN climate treaty, to capturing Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro following an attack on the capital Caracas and threatening to annex Greenland from close ally Denmark. 

Just days before the start of the WEF meeting, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight NATO allies, including Germany, France and the UK, if they don't support his quest to take control of the Arctic island, eliciting a forceful rebuke from the European allies. Trump's assault on the international rules that have largely been in place since World War II, and its impact on the global peace, politics and the economy is expected to be among the key topics during the five-day event beginning January 19 under the theme A Spirit of Dialogue.

Largest US delegation ever in Davos
Trump is leading the largest US delegation ever to Davos, comprising five cabinet secretaries and other senior officials. The delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve ​Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, setting the stage for high-profile discussions on Ukraine, Venezuela, Gaza and Iran, where eyewitnesses have reported a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests. Trump is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kyiv's G7 allies — including leaders from Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Canada and the European Commission president — on the sidelines of the main event to seek US backing for security guarantees for Ukraine after a possible peace agreement with Russia. European leaders and officials are expected to use their meetings with the US president and his team to discuss Greenland and urge him to retract his tariff threat. The strong US presence would be complemented by the first-ever "USA House" — a venue housed in a small church on the town's main Promenade street, where US officials will host events and network with investors.

We cannot do what we do without your support.Poland saw the European Union’s second-fastest growth in tourism in 2025, behind only the Mediterranean island state of Malta. The figures come amid efforts by the Polish government to boost the role of tourism in the economy.New data from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency, show that the estimated number of nights spent in tourist accommodation rose by 7% in Poland in 2025 compared to a year earlier. That placed it behind Malta (+9.9%) and ahead of Latvia (+6.2%), Lithuania and Luxembourg (both +6.1%).Tourism in traditional powerhouses France (+3%), Italy (+2.1%) and Spain (+1.6%) rose modestly, while two countries experienced a decline: Romania (-1.4%) and Ireland (-1.8%).In absolute terms, however, Poland remains well behind other destinations. It had an estimated total of 104.5 million nights spent in tourist accommodation in 2025, well below leaders Spain (513.1 million), Italy (476.0 million) and France (471.3 million).Poland also found itself behind the smaller countries of Greece (156.2 million), the Netherlands (148.0 million) and Austria (133.6 million).Eurostat notes that Poland had one of the lowest proportions of international visitors. Just 19.2% of its tourist accommodation nights were accounted for by foreign guests. Only Germany (18.9%) and Romania (17.6%) had lower figures.Malta (94.1%) had the highest proportion of foreign visitors, followed by Cyprus (92.7%), Croatia (90.3%) and Luxembourg (88.1%). Spain (64.2%) and Italy (55.5%) both had a majority of international guests, while in France (31.9%) they were a minority.However, last year, the tourism sector accounted for only around 4% of GDP, well below the EU-wide figure of 10%. The current government is hoping to change that, launching plans in September for tourism to contribute 9% of GDP by 2030.

We cannot do what we do without your support.A fundraising campaign in Poland has so far received over 3 million zloty (€710,000) in donations to help Ukrainians amid the current winter freeze and Russian attacks that have cut off electricity and heating. Ukraine’s foreign minister has thanked Poles for their “true solidarity and humanity”.With temperatures dropping below 15°C (5°F) in many parts of Ukraine, people have been struggling to keep warm without power. President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting heating and energy infrastructure to make civilians suffer.Last week, the Warsaw-based Stand With Ukraine Foundation launched an online fundraiser to purchase power generators for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It initially aimed to raise 1 million zloty, but that target was met within three days.The organisers have since then upped the goal to 2 million, 3 million and now 5 million zloty. As of Monday morning, just over 3 million zloty had been raised from over 25,000 donors, many also leaving messages of support.“You will survive; you are not alone,” wrote one donor, Iwona. “Hold on, just a little longer, we are with you,” commented another, Justyna.“The response of Poles has exceeded our expectations…Your solidarity is incredible,” wrote the organisers. “Thanks to your donations, we can do much more than we planned…This money will provide real warmth for people in Ukraine. We will buy more generators, sleeping bags, and fuel.”They also announced that Polenergia, Poland’s largest private energy group, and the Kulczyk Foundation, a charitable organisation, have joined the initiative, donating 500,000 zloty to purchase generators.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, also expressed his country’s gratitude to Poles for their support.“This is an expression of true solidarity, humanity, and sincere support at a time when warmth and light mean safety and life,” he wrote in Polish on social media. “We feel that we are not alone. Thank you, Poland, for such important help…in the darkest moments.”In the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland and its people provided enormous support to their eastern neighbours. Millions of Ukrainian refugees arrived in Poland, where many were hosted by Poles in their own homes. Huge amounts of aid were donated.Almost a million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland. However, public sentiment has recently been turning against them. A poll published this month by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.In September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.Far-right political groups, such as Confederation (Konfederacja) and Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP), have also been increasingly vocal in stirring opposition to the large-scale presence of Ukrainians in Poland and Poland’s financial and military support for Ukraine.
