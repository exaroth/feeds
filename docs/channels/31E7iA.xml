That's according to the European Union's naval mission, whose operations aim to protect international shipping from attacks.

The Strait of Hormuz, between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, is a vital export route for the Gulf's biggest oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Around 20% of the world's crude oil flows through it. Experts have warned that even a limited disruption could cause energy prices to spike... and fuel inflation.

From drought-stricken vineyards in Chile to new wine regions emerging in Germany, this episode of Transforming Business shows how climate change is reshaping where wine can be made, how it is produced, and who can still compete.
As extreme weather, water scarcity, and rising temperatures disrupt one of the world’s most climate-sensitive industries, winemakers are forced to adapt in very different ways, from ancestral agroecology to cutting-edge climate science. The result is a global wine map that is quietly being redrawn.
