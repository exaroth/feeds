They will discuss Trump's peace plan for Ukraine - which is widely seen as echoing Russian demands. When asked about criticism of his 28-point peace plan for being too favorable to Russia, Trump described it as a "map, not a plan," saying that it has been revised down to 22 points. Trump also stressed that Moscow too was "making concessions," adding that they come in the form that "they stop fighting, and they don't take any more land." Trump moreover said there was no deadline for the talks. "You know what the deadline for me is? When it's over," he said.

In a virtual meeting between Ukraine and its allies, President Volodymyr signalled support for the proposal - but said sensitive issues need to be addressed with President Trump. Despite talks progressing, Russia launched a mass drone assault in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, injuring dozens. Authorities say more than 30 apartment blocks were damaged.

"In scenarios where markets may perform less well, perhaps concerns about the fiscal trajectory or concerns about questions about Fed independence, I think gold would do even better than in the already attractive base case."

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, Rachel Reeves will unveil her second budget today, which is expected to include a slew of tax hikes to fill a £20 billion hole. But higher levies have been a hard sell to voters struggling with affordability, another issue the Chancellor is focused on. 

Bloomberg has learned that White House National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, is being seen as the frontrunner to be the next Fed chair. It comes as the search for Jerome Powell's successor heads into its final weeks.

President Donald Trump says he's dispatched top negotiators for additional high-level meetings with both Russia and Ukraine but would only be willing to meet both leaders when a deal to end the war is in the final stages. The President says Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is likely to meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Moscow next week.

So what’s actually on the table?
DW’s Misha Komadovsky spoke with Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna, who says Ukraine convinced negotiators in Geneva to drop a “full amnesty” clause — keeping the door open for Russia to be held accountable for war crimes. Stefanishyna offers a unique perspective on diplomacy during the ongoing ukraine war.

And one senior Ukrainian official tells DW that Kyiv now wants a one-on-one meeting with President Trump before any potential trilateral talks with Putin.

The leaders of Britain, France and Germany have expressed their support for US President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war following a meeting of the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' on Tuesday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said revised US peace proposals are now workable – and that Kyiv has a 'common understanding' with Washington. Despite this, as the talks were ongoing Russia has launched another wave of drone and missile attacks against Ukraine – killing at least seven people in Kyiv.

The order targets chapters in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, among others, directing US government departments to determine if the chapters are terrorist groups. If the US finds that to be the case, that could lead to sanctions or other measures. Egypt and Jordan have already banned the organization. 

The Muslim Brotherhood was founded almost 100 years ago in Egypt. Its greatest political success was when its leader Mohammed Morsi became president of Egypt in 2012, only to be ousted by the military a year later. It has historical connections to Hamas, which started as a Palestinian nationalist offshoot of the group.

In its latest report on femicide, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that some 83,000 women and girls were deliberately killed last year. More than half of those killings were committed by relatives or partners. The reality of gender-based violence was spotlighted this year by Gisèle Pelicot. The French survivor chose to waive her anonymity during the trial of her husband and dozens of other men, who drugged and raped her for years.

Authorities say gunmen have taken 11 women and children captive from a village in western Kwara state. It's near the site where kidnappers took at least 35 people a week earlier. Police say they're searching for the attackers. Nigeria is grappling with a long-running crisis involving both kidnapping for ransom and jihadist violence. US President Donald Trump has threatened military action to protect Christians, such as the 300 children seized from a Catholic School last week. But many of the victims of the attacks are also Muslim, and Nigeria's government rejects the US narrative.

President Trump said last week that he would bring an end to the conflict, which erupted in 2023 over a power struggle and which has led to ethnically motivated mass killings, mass displacement and nationwide famine. Sudan's army has denounced the participation of the United Arab Emirates in peace talks, because of their alleged role in arming the RSF. Here in Europe, the European Parliament is discussing a ban on the sale of weapons to Abu Dhabi, in an effort to stop them being used in Sudan.

As talks continue, Russia and Ukraine exchanged fire overnight, with airstrikes on Kyiv and southern Russian areas, resulting in casualties and damage to infrastructure. Bloomberg's Jennifer Welch joined Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily' to break it down.

It's thought to be nearly 12,000 years since it last erupted. The eruption covered nearby villages in volcanic dust and sent a cloud of ash cloud drifting across the Red Sea. Plumes have already reached Yemen, Oman, northern Pakistan, and India, where they caused flights to be cancelled. No casualties have been recorded, but officials say the livelihoods of livestock owners could be affected as the ash may reduce available grazing areas.

No bus replacement service.It’s hard not to be impressed by the engineering state, where progress is measured in concrete and steel, driven by the relentless ambition of the Chinese Communist Party.Yet China’s Gen Z aren’t happy.Their grandparents lived through the Great Leap Forward, when up to 50 million Chinese died of starvation as a result of Chairman Mao’s deranged attempts to turn China from an agrarian to an industrial society overnight.Their parents survived the Cultural Revolution, when many perished because they were deemed bourgeois enemies of the Communist state.But the single children of China’s economic success don’t have to worry about survival. They have the luxury of wondering about the meaning of life.‘The garbage time of history’In a cafe in Tiangzhu, a green suburb of the mega-city of Hangzhou, I met Mengling Xu, a graduate of Fudan, one of China’s top universities.“After graduating I just work, work, work, work,” she complained. “Relaxation time is very limited.”She had given up her job in a Shanghai investment company, and spent some time in the west of China trying to find herself and recover from depression.“After graduating I just work, work, work, work.”“This is ‘lishi de laji shijian’, the garbage time of history,” she said.To explain: ‘garbage time’ is an American sports term, meaning the last minutes of a game where one team is so far ahead the result is a foregone conclusion.Gen Z has adopted the concept to express their feeling that there’s nothing they can do to affect the course of events.They are the opposite of the Tiananmen generation, who tried to change history and were punished for their bravery. Another new concept is ‘tangping’, meaning ‘lie flat’ – in other words, drop out.The Party is increasingly worried about this disillusioned generation.Enter Felix Tao, an AI innovator who has returned to China from Silicon Valley. He’s developing ‘Second Me’, an AI app “which essentially aims to help people to create their digital identity using AI.“I’m particularly passionate about AI technology, especially its applications in social interactions, personal growth and productivity enhancement.” That was his AI avatar speaking, by the way, as it (he?) addressed me from his smartphone.The idea is that the hassle of making friends can be eased by getting your avatar to do all the initial bit of working out whether you like each other.I know, I know. People like me (AKA old people) think that’s the fun part of meeting someone new. I’m delighted that I met Felix in person, surrounded by his techy friends, in his living room.But this new online generation experience things differently. Everyone in Tiangzhu – often called China’s Silicon Valley – is developing an AI app.Mengling Xu hopes hers could help other depressed young people to recover their energy – a high tech answer to existential angst.In the US, Wall Street investors are worrying about an AI bubble – maybe they have pumped too much money into the big Silicon Valley companies. Across the western world, people are fretting about AI’s potential to act autonomously and take control of our lives.I heard no such doubts in China. The Party’s buttoned up men in suits see AI as the new high speed rail, a high-tech way of boosting the economy and winning the battle with the US for the future.They’re also hoping that the brave new world of AI will inspire this baffling new generation, whose form of rebellion is not to stand defiantly in front of a tank, but to do nothing at all.Thanks for reading the latest edition of our free FourGround newsletter.Subscribe here to keep up to date with Channel 4 News on Substack.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google, the sleeping giant in global AI race, is now “fully awake”</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4XjZnusGRg4</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4XjZnusGRg4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:30:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the launch of ChatGPT three years ago, analysts and technologists — even a Google engineer and the company’s former chief executive — have declared Google behind in the high-stakes race to develop artificial intelligence.

Bloomberg's Nancy Cook joins Sarah Holder on the Big Take podcast to unpack Trump's latest strategy to help bring affordability to Americans.

Under new pressures over inflation and affordability, President Donald Trump has been talking up a plan to share tariff revenues with Americans, in the form of $2,000 checks. But there are several major problems with this plan — and he’s lacking support among some of his most ardent allies. On today’s Big Take episode, host Sarah Holder is joined by Bloomberg senior national political reporter Nancy Cook and US Treasury reporter Dan Flatley to discuss how Trump’s latest proposal fits into the economic  debate that could define midterm elections – and how the Supreme Court, the Republican party and Trump’s own cabinet could throw a wrench in his plans.

Hassett is seen as someone who would bring the president’s approach to interest rate cutting to the Fed, which Trump has long wanted to control, some of the people said.  Bloomberg's Nancy Cook joins Joe Mathieu to discuss.

It is a blueprint for a Trump defeat and Putin win, and that’s why it has to be changed fundamentally.”Mr Rasmussen, who served as Denmark’s PM from 2001 to 2009, said: “Europe must step forward robustly and play hard power politics, which means give robust security guarantees to Ukraine, backed up by troop presence in Ukraine, and secondly unlock frozen Russian assets for Ukraine.”While he said that he appreciated American efforts to initiate the peace process, Mr Rasmussen added: “I find it quite embarrassing that the Europeans are begging and asking for a seat at the table. We should have a seat at the table because we’re indispensable and the way to make yourself indispensable would be to bring something to the table, and that should be concrete security guarantees for Ukraine.”“Europe must step forward robustly and play hard power politics, which means give robust security guarantees to Ukraine, backed up by troop presence in Ukraine.”He told Channel 4 News those guarantees, and any US security guarantee, must involve troops in Ukraine.“The fact is that Putin doesn’t care about paper guarantees,” he said.“It’s only guarantees backed up by a concrete military presence that he will respect.”Mr Rasmussen said he estimated that Europe would need to send 20,000 troops – but he stressed that they should not be on the frontline.He told Channel 4 News that Europe should also send 150 combat aircraft, and “establish an air shield to protect these cities in Ukraine.”“The fact is that Putin doesn’t care about paper guarantees.”Asked if Europe has the assets to do this, he said yes, “but obviously the deterrent effect would be much stronger if the US would back up such a European reassurance force by intelligence sharing, space surveillance, aircraft, transport, etc.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Retail Sales Growth Slows in September, PPI Increases 0.3%</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPwZfLohEuE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oPwZfLohEuE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:56:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US retail sales rose modestly in September, as the value of retail purchases, not adjusted for inflation, increased 0.2% after a 0.6% gain in August.

Kyiv and its allies quickly hammered out a counter-proposal, which Kyiv says is 'workable'. But will the White House or the Kremlin agree to the changes? What are Ukraine's red lines? Is Russia ready to soften its hardline demands? Or will the US pressure Ukraine to accept a raw deal for peace?

Meta is in discussions to use the Google chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, The Information reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. An agreement would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia’s chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms.

US stock futures eased after a tech-fueled rally in the S&P 500, as traders look ahead to a slate of economic data to gauge whether optimism over a potential Federal Reserve interest-rate cut can hold up. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 was little changed. Asia’s regional benchmark climbed 0.6%, buoyed by gains in Chinese shares after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held their first talks since agreeing to a tariff truce last month. Traders are watching US data ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, including September retail sales and producer prices due later Tuesday.

Trump’s hour-long conversation with President Xi Jinping on Monday marked their first contact since Japan’s new prime minister enraged Beijing by suggesting her nation’s troops could be drawn into a Taiwan crisis.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the European Union needs to change its digital regulations in order to get a deal to lower steel and aluminum tariffs.
