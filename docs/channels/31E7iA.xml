India giving a warm welcome to a senior Afghan Taliban leader may seem surprising. But it reflects a new dynamic in South Asia. As tensions grow between the Taliban government in Kabul and Pakistan, New Delhi sees an opportunity to strengthen its own position in the region by exploring diplomatic, trade and economic ties with the Taliban.

But Pakistan is now fighting the Afghan Taliban it once helped create. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, Pakistan's powerful secret service, the ISI, supported the Mujahideen fighters who formed the Taliban with money, training and weapons. The Taliban regime has been back in power since the sudden withdrawal of US and NATO troops in 2021.
 
A recent shaky ceasefire between Pakistan and the Taliban government in Kabul is complicated by another Taliban grouping: The Pakistani Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP have been carrying out suicide bombings and attacks in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused the Afghan Taliban of backing the terrorist group and also of giving them refuge inside Afghanistan. But the Afghan Taliban has denied the claims and is now looking to Pakistan's archrival India for support. Meanwhile, a colonial-era border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Durand Line, is adding fuel to the fire.

And a public fundraiser in Poland to buy more generators has now received almost 7 million zloty (€1.7 million) in donations.Ukrainians have been struggling to stay warm amid temperatures regularly dropping below -15°C. Currently, almost 60% of buildings in Kyiv have no electricity and a similar proportion lack heating. President Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Russia of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure to make civilians suffer.In response, Poland announced on Friday that Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ordered the delivery of 379 electricity generator and 18 heating units from the Government Strategic Reserve Agency (RARS) to Ukraine.Government spokesman Adam Szłapka revealed that the equipment is worth around 7 million zloty in total. Shipments began on Friday and are set to be completed next week.“Poland once again reaffirms its role as a key partner to Ukraine in the field of humanitarian aid,” declared Tusk’s office. “The donated equipment will enable the operation of heating stations and public facilities, providing a real protective barrier against the effects of winter in war-affected regions.”Poland, which is the main logistics hub for international support to its eastern neighbour, will also help facilitate the delivery of a further 447 generators being sent by the European Union from its reserves to Ukraine.On Friday, Warsaw’s mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, announced that his city has readied 90 generators for immediate transport to Kyiv, following an appeal from the Ukrainian capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko.“Putin is brutally attacking critical infrastructure,” said Trzaskowski. “We are extending our assistance to Kyiv and our solidarity with the Ukrainian people.”Meanwhile, a public fundraiser in Poland to provide generators and other heating equipment to Ukraine, which had an initial target of 1 million zloty, has so raised 6.8 million zloty (€1.6 million) from over 50,000 donors.On Friday, the first set of generators bought with the money was set to be delivered to Ukraine, reports news website Onet.Earlier this week, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, thanked Poles for their “true solidarity, humanity, and sincere support at a time when warmth and light mean safety and life”.

But that was actually only the start. Now Bangladesh and its more than 170 million people are at a crossroads. There are strong forces that would pull Bangladesh back towards authoritarianism. But the path towards democracy is also an option. February’s election and referendum on a new constitution are a first step. We speak to two Bangladeshi legal experts to discuss what the country needs to do in three crucial areas to move towards a democratic future.

DW Chief Political Correspondent
So, Ines, if you could just maybe help me get this thought across that there is a lot... Germany and Europe do hold cards, right? Also, in terms of defense, what are the cards that you would say Germany needs to put into the window more? 

Ines Pohl
DW Washington Bureau Chief
I mean, you just explained it, right? There are major, very strategically, highly important operations being led in Germany. And then, of course, also the wounded soldiers being flown in. That's something many, kind of, American families have experienced, that Germany plays a major role here. But, Nina, the problem is, when it comes to the public discourse, Donald Trump has really, kind of, taken this understanding away and is dominating the discourse with exactly what you said: "Germany and Europe... They have great schools. They don't pay anything. They have great streets. They have everything cheap for the average people because we pay for them." And this is, kind of, this is what most Americans believe now. They don't — I mean, if you talk, of course, to a military expert, they would totally agree that the United States needs Germany also for their own security and safety reasons — but the average Americans don't see that anymore, especially as Donald Trump also says, you know, "I'm a peacemaker. I stopped so many wars. I want us to be less involved in other countries, militarily-wise." So, Germany, in this strategic thinking, is becoming even less important. That's, I think, not true. But if you ask the majority of the Americans, they would, I think, go by now with Donald Trump's false claims.

DW Chief Political Correspondent
So, William, you did work at NATO for a couple of years. You were in Brussels. Did you ever think that we would ever reach a situation where we would, in all earnestness, all seriousness, discuss the possibility of one NATO ally as big as the US invading another ally? 

William Alberque
Security Analyst, Pacific Forum
Well, I have to say, part of my time there — I was there from 2012 to 2020 — so I was there for the first Trump administration. And the bigger fear was that Trump was going to withdraw from NATO. He had said that out loud, and one of the things about when he came back for the second term was he was going to settle scores. And so, you know, a lot of us thought that that was part of the unfinished business. And looking at the situation with Greenland, it was hard not to look at that as potentially Trump trying to force the issue, trying to force, because if he did take Greenland by force, it would be the end of NATO. And so maybe this was sort of a passive way, because he knew that if he just told Congress he was going to withdraw, they would... even the Republicans would slow him down or stop him. So, this was probably a backdoor way of doing it. And so, you know, with at least the temporary news of the prevention of that happening, that's very good news. But there have been conflicts between NATO allies before. There was the fisheries war, where allies did shoot at each other. There was Greece versus Turkey over Cyprus, and that was a brutal war of conquest, you know, between NATO allies that caused a huge rift, but managed to, you know, NATO managed to survive that. So, on the one hand, I did expect strange things to happen with NATO during this term, never over Greenland. That was a real surprise. But, unfortunately, we are just in this era of complete uncertainty with where the US is going, and so we have to continue to watch it really carefully. And it's an important game of diplomacy that's happening right now.

Human rights groups say more than 5,000 people have been killed - most of them protesters. Reports say tens of thousands have been detained. 

Against that backdrop, the US military has moved a major aircraft carrier strike group closer to the Middle East. The Pentagon says it's a precautionary move, but Donald Trump has threatened the use of force against the Iranian regime if the killing of protesters in Iran continues. 

Speaking aboard Air Force One, he described the naval build-up as an 'armada' - and outlined the threats he'd made to Tehran.

Natural gas prices surged on concern iced-over equipment will choke supplies. Airlines have already canceled almost 4,000 flights and Amtrak has pulled dozens of trips from its schedule.

Without a warrant, it was illegal for ICE agents to enter someone's property. 

An internal memo obtained by the Associated Press says immigration officers may now forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant. The dramatic shift comes amid wide-spread protests and deep opposition to ICE agents and their tactics, particularly in Minnesota. The state of Minnesota specifically has been on edge since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good.

The three-way talks are following President Trump's talks with President Zelenskyy in Switzerland, and separate late-night discussions in Moscow on Thursday between the Russian President Vladimir Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff and the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner. 

Kyiv says the key issue is the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It's an industrial area along the Russian border that Russia has partially occupied since 2014, and has seen some of this war's fiercest fighting. 
Ukraine rejects Russia's claim to the territory, insisting that it remains sovereign Ukrainian land. 

Life under constant Russian bombardment means many Ukrainians are living without basics like heating - amid freezing winter temperatures. The country's grid operator say the energy situation has 'significantly' worsened following recent Russian air attacks. The European Union is sending hundreds more generators to Ukraine, to power hospitals, shelters and other key infrastructure.

It's the first time officials from Russia, Ukraine and the US are known to have met face-to-face for negotiations since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The talks are taking place after US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner traveled to Moscow, where they spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. A Kremlin official describedthose talks as useful. But Moscow has since repeated its demand that Ukraine hand over territory in the eastern Donbas region that's still controlled by Kyiv.

About 42% of the rise in goods trade in 2025 stemmed from AI investment — including computer hardware, software and other equipment needed to build infrastructure like data centers. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director-general, spoke with Bloomberg Television on Friday.

We cannot do what we do without your support.General Roman Polko, who commanded Poland’s GROM special forces unit in Iraq and Afghanistan, has condemned Donald Trump’s recent comments suggesting that America’s allies have not provided frontline military support to the United States.Polko, who is now retired, called the US president “a coward who has never been on the front lines”. Meanwhile, Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, declared that “no one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers”.Amid tensions over Trump’s efforts to take control of Greenland, the US president has repeatedly questioned whether his country can rely on its NATO allies.“Will they be there, if we ever needed them?” Trump asked on Thursday in an interview with Fox News. “I’m not sure of that.”“We’ve never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did – they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” he continued.In actual fact, military personnel from various NATO allies served in combat roles in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq this century, with many losing their lives.In Afghanistan, the highest number of casualties after the United States (2,461 deaths) were for the UK (457), Canada (159), France (90), Germany (62), Italy (53) and Poland (44). In Iraq, 23 Polish soldiers were killed, behind only the US (4,492), UK (179) and Italy (33).Among those to serve in both arenas was Polko, who was commander of GROM from 2000 to 2004 and again in 2006. Since ending his military service in 2009, he has served as a security advisor to three presidents, Lech Kaczyński, Bronisław Komorowski and Andrzej Duda.General Polko (left) visiting Polish troops in Afghanistan in 2007 as head of President Lech Kaczyński’s National Security Bureau (source: BBN)Speaking on Friday to broadcaster TVN, Polka said that Trump’s latest remarks had “crossed a red line”, especially coming from someone who never served in the military.“This is the cynicism of a coward who hasn’t been on the front lines himself,” declared the general. “In this respect, he resembles Putin, who also wages wars but has never even approached the front lines himself.”Polish soldiers were “on the front lines, supporting peacekeeping efforts and risking their own lives to ensure that people were not terrorised by al-Qaeda”. In a further interview with broadcaster TVP, Polko also called on Trump to apologise.Meanwhile, Poland’s defence minister, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, published a statement on Friday highlighting Poland’s contribution to allied efforts.“Poland has always been, is, and will be a responsible and reliable ally that, at the moment when security is threatened, stands in its defence,” he wrote on social media. “The Polish army, shoulder to shoulder with allies, took part, among others, in missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.”“Tragic moments, when our soldiers died, showed that, in defence of international security, of Poland’s security, we are ready to pay the highest price. This sacrifice will never be forgotten and must not be diminished. Poland is a reliable and proven ally, and nothing will change that.”Foreign minister Radosław Sikorski also noted that the province of Ghazni where Polish forces served in Afghanistan was very much on the frontlines. “No one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers,” he added.Sikorski also shared an image of Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki – who is an opponent of the government and ally of Trump – meeting the US president this week, adding sarcastically: “The commander-in-chief of the [Polish] armed forces with surely assert the honour of our soliders.”In response, Nawrocki’s spokesman, Rafał Leśkiewicz, criticised Sikorski for “exploiting Polish soldiers” for political purposes. He added that “President Karol Nawrocki, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, has always stood, stands, and will always stand by Polish soldiers”.On Friday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also criticised Trump’s recent remarks about America’s allies, calling them “insulting and frankly appalling” and suggesting that the US president should apologise.

What exactly does that mean? How would US soldiers and bombs help protect Germany in a worst-case scenario? What options does Germany have to move toward a European umbrella? And why is this context so relevant when assessing the current German recalibration of its international diplomacy? In this episode of Berlin Briefing, host Nina Haase talks with her guests about Germany’s deep dependencies on the United States -from NATO cooperation to nuclear deterrence. Security analyst William Alberque and DW’s Washington bureau chief Ines Pohl join Nina to unpack the diplomatic fallout from President Trump’s controversial Greenland remarks, Germany’s limited missile‑defense capabilities, and the complex realities of nuclear sharing within NATO.
