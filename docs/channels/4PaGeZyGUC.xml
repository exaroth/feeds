Emerging from the steppes of Central Asia, the Seljuks united inner-city Persia with Turkic cavalry might, transforming political and cultural landscapes across Iran, Iraq, and Anatolia. Under Tughril Beg, they consolidated power in the early 11th century, capturing Ray and routing rival dynasties to establish the Great Seljuk state. The empire expanded under Alp Arslan, whose victory at Manzikert in 1071 shattered Byzantium’s frontier and opened Anatolia to Turkish settlement, setting the stage for the Turkic-ruled Sultanate of Rum. Malik Shah I presided over a prosperous era, supported by the brilliant vizier Nizam al-Mulk and a thriving network of madrasas that fused Sunni scholarship with Persian administrative sophistication. The Seljuks pioneered a centralized yet adaptive governance model, blending military prowess with a sophisticated bureaucratic system that influenced governance across the region for centuries. As they defended eastern borders against rival powers and fostered a rich cultural milieu, their rise also created the conditions for Crusades to enter the Levant. This video unpacks the key figures, battles, and institutions that defined the Seljuk ascent, and traces their enduring legacy in Anatolia, Iran, and the broader Islamic world. If you love medieval history and the fusion of Turkic and Persian influences, subscribe for more on the rise and legacy of the Seljuk Turks.

But a number of projects offer assistance and encouragement. Affordable housing, social networking, and childcare services are designed to ease the burden.

Single parents in Europe can increasingly rely on help and support from people, associations, and institutions to help them balance raising children with work, financial issues, and mental overload. 

"A secure, affordable living situation - that's such a key issue in the lives of single parents,” says Sarah Zeller. A few years ago, she found herself confronting this issue when, along with another friend and her child, she decided to set up a shared apartment for the two single parent families. But they searched in vain for an affordable apartment with enough space. 

This predicament gave rise to an innovative approach. In 2015, the German native founded the non-profit association JUNO in Vienna. Working with property developers, the association plans and develops compact and affordable apartments for single parents. With her idea, the founder has now helped over 160 families find a suitable apartment. 

The Belgian region of Wallonia has set itself the goal of strengthening the social position of single parents. Amandine Dedoncker is a social worker involved in the "Relais Familles Mono” program, creating services tailored to the needs of single parents. The government program enables single parents to learn practical skills, meet other mothers or fathers, and be part of a community. As a population group particularly affected by loneliness, this is extremely important for single parents‘ mental health. 
When other families have free time, on Saturdays Bianka Baumann is at work: in a supermarket in Rostock. The single mother and sales assistant works weekends. But who looks after her son Linus, during a time when most daycare centers are closed? An innovative daycare center here makes her weekend work possible by offering overnight care for parents who work night shifts. 
All of this is financed by the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A model that supports single parents - and makes it possible to truly balance work and family life.

This documentary explores the remarkable life of the woman who served as the longest-serving Princess of Wales and eventually Queen Consort to King Edward VII.

While the Edwardian era is often remembered for its lavish parties and the "Marlborough House Set," Alexandra’s private reality was defined by her battle with progressive deafness and the "Alexandra Limp"—a physical disability caused by rheumatic fever that, bizarrely, became a viral fashion trend among the Victorian elite. From her "rags-to-riches" journey as a Danish princess to her complicated marriage to a "Playboy King," we reveal how she navigated his high-profile mistresses (including Alice Keppel) and the strict demands of Queen Victoria.

Newly evaluated archive material, eyewitnesses, and experts document the extent, background, and consequences of this warfare.

A little-known chapter of colonial violence: The French army secretly used chemical weapons against independence fighters during the Algerian War (1954-1962). Maps, documents, and eyewitness accounts from French and Algerian veterans document the dimension of this warfare, as well as the human suffering it caused. 

Interviews with experts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons explain how military and political decision-makers organized these secret attacks. In addition to the torture and displacement of entire population groups, the use of chemical weapons constituted a huge breach of France's international obligations. Obligations France deliberately disregarded during its colonial war. 

Step by step, the film reveals the impact of this warfare on Algeria’s land and people. The film illuminates both the historical events, and their current relevance.

The only problem for its supporters? It doesn't officially exist. 

After the Yugoslav Wars, the border between Serbia and Croatia along the Danube River remained unresolved. Vit Jedlička, a former politician from the Czech Republic, saw an opportunity. In 2015, he declared the “Free Republic of Liberland” on a 7-square-kilometer piece of land. 

The Liberland experiment may seem like an oddity, but it also raises serious questions: Cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks are undermining traditional national borders, and radical market ideas are gaining influence. Parallel structures are emerging. Critics see them as a threat to democracy, whereas supporters see an opening.

This video explores the 2026 "Deep Freeze" of the crypto market, analyzing why the "digital gold" thesis has failed to protect investors as Bitcoin lags behind the S&P 500 total returns. We dive into the "Victory Paradox"—the irony that Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance through Wall Street ETFs and a "crypto-friendly" presidency has tethered it to traditional financial risks, destroying its status as an uncorrelated asset. From the $12 billion losses at Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and the liquidity crisis at institutional prime broker BlockFills to the Great AI Pivot in the mining industry, we break down the structural traps currently paralyzing the ecosystem. Featuring insights on "Financial Nihilism" from Demetri Kofinas, the "Juggalo Theory" of crypto subcultures from Zeke Faux, and the massive migration toward prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, we ask the ultimate forward-looking question: now that Bitcoin is fully financialized, will it ever be an independent asset again?

His sphere of influence included top political officials, CEOs, corporate executives, finance managers, and even a member of the British royal family. How did he manage it? It turns out it was by establishing an elaborate network of influence and access that went well beyond the norms and expectations of the rich and famous.

What were the tipping points that nearly brought Epstein to justice in the 14 years before his first conviction and his final 2019 arrest? What were the structures and systems that failed to stop him from abusing and exploiting young women and girls in those 14 years? In this episode, we tick through the guest lists and institutions that continued to profit from relationships with Jeffrey Epstein — and which helped him remain free, in turn.

We will also talk about many of the conspiracy theories that have popped up since the latest tranche of Epstein documents came out. Was Epstein a national security asset? Did he actually kill himself?

Independent journalist Tara Palmeri, author of the Red Letter Substack and host of The Tara Palmeri Show, argues that conspiracies are important to help the public understand the extent and scope of the Epstein scandal — since for so long, so much about the story was covered up. We’ll make sense of which conspiracies have validity and which are tinfoil hat material, in this interview with a journalist who has long advocated for and written about the Epstein survivors.

We know that ICE was created in 2003. So what exactly do they mean by that? To unpack this claim, Vox producer Nate Krieger examines the history of immigration enforcement in the US. 

The story of American immigration is one of gradual change. Over time, the role of the immigration services slowly changed, morphing from an agency that managed labor and benefits to one that saw itself as law enforcement, with a focus on national security. 

And with that shift came a growth in capacity. The first federal immigration agency was created in 1891 with a total staff of 4 people. Today, with ICE, that number is over 22,000.

So how did immigration restrictions and enforcement change over the span of American history? By examining the centuries of events that culminated in the creation of ICE, we can begin to understand the context that created this modern agency.

This is a remastered version of our Ice Age video from July 2025. We've made a few changes, but apologies if you've watched the video already! 

In this video, we’re travelling back to Earth's frozen past, to discover what our planet was like during the Ice Age. What massive creatures dominated these icy landscapes, and what caused their extinction? We'll also ask a chilling question: could it happen again? Join us as we explore the rise and fall of Earth's frozen past and look for the warning signs of its return.

How to make prawn compound butter and use it to cook Poulet Sacha Guitry — a classic French chicken dish with cream, Madeira and morels.

This recipe was originally created by Fernand Point, the legendary chef behind La Pyramide restaurant in Vienne, France. He dedicated it to Sacha Guitry, the famous French actor and screenwriter, who loved crayfish butter. I've adapted it for the home kitchen using cooked prawns.
A compound butter is a flavoured butter made by blending softened butter with other ingredients — in this case, cooked prawns with their shells and coral. What makes this dish unique is that the compound butter is not just served on top. It is used as a cooking fat, and then whisked into the sauce at the end to give it a rich, silky shellfish finish.

In this video you will learn how to:

Make a prawn compound butter from scratch using a stick blender
Cook chicken breasts à blanc (with minimal colour)
White-cook mushrooms in butter, lemon and water
Build a French cream sauce using Madeira wine
Use compound butter as a sauce thickener and enrichment
Prepare and sauté dried morels

This is Part 1 of a 3-part series on compound butters in French cooking.

disclaimer (updated May 2025): voidzilla is an opinion‑driven channel that comments on the news of the day under the satirical and rhetorically hyperbolic banner “CRIME IS LEGAL.” the phrase critiques what we see as a lax or uneven regulatory enforcement environment for fraud. unlike our affiliated channel Coffeezilla, which conducts detailed investigations and source‑document deep dives, and draws opinions from that, voidzilla offers rapid‑fire commentary and criticism on information already in the public domain. statements here reflect the host’s views at the moment of recording and may become outdated as facts evolve. references to “crime,” “fraud,” “scam,” or similar terms appear in a rhetorical hyperbolic context similar to “CRIME IS LEGAL.” unless we expressly state that a court has entered a final judgment, no segment should be read as a definitive finding of legal liability. viewers are urged to consult primary sources and form independent conclusions. production of this program is public‑interest commentary protected by the First Amendment and the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA).

We've known that the universe is expanding since 1929, and that its expansion is accelerating since 1998. The culprit behind the acceleration is unknown, so we live with a stand-in term "dark energy". Our modern cosmological model assumes that dark energy has a constant density--always the same amount of the outward-shoving stuff per volume. But there's recent evidence to the contrary--which may be why our primary efforts to measure the expansion rate of the universe disagree with each other.
