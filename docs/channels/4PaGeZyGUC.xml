Uncover the dramatic true story of Prince Albert Victor, the man who was destined to be King but instead became one of the Victorian era's most controversial figures. Known as "Eddy" to his family, Queen Victoria's grandson and the eldest son of King Edward VII lived a life defined by privilege, mystery, and explosive royal scandals.

In this full documentary, we investigate the events that shadowed his legacy—from the notorious Cleveland Street Scandal and rumours of a secret life in London’s underworld to the sensational (though debunked) theories linking him to the Jack the Ripper murders. Was there a royal cover-up to protect the heir apparent, or was he a "black sheep" prince unfairly targeted by the press?

We also explore his tragic death at just 28 during the 1892 influenza pandemic, an event that changed British royal history forever by paving the way for his brother, King George V. Featuring insights into his education at Trinity College, his military service, and his failed romances, this biography reveals the human story behind the "Lost King."

This technology for producing fresh water was a blessing for the islands. Now, it could prove to be a curse for the ecosystem.

This water treatment system is essential for life in the area - but is it compatible with the principles of sustainable development?

Due to limited freshwater resources and rising demand, the first seawater desalination plant in Europe was built in the Canary Islands. It is often touted as a perfect solution. Today, the Canary Islands have the highest number of desalinations plants in the world, relative to the islands’ size and population. 

The fresh water obtained in this way is indispensable for human life on the volcanic islands, but - since it appears to be available in abundance - it also encourages unbridled economic development, such as mass tourism and the intensive monoculture of bananas for export. 

Moreover, seawater desalination is anything but climate-neutral. The plants consume vast amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. The brine returned to the sea destroys marine life and contributes to ocean acidification. 

The film sheds light for the first time on this region's dependence on desalinated seawater. The documentary also explains how water desalination works, and the various impacts that need to be considered.
 
Aware of the urgent need to protect nature, their own health and the future of their children, the Canarian people are working together with scientists to find alternative solutions for sustainable water management. 

Thanks to decades of experience, the Canary Islands are now leaders in the field of seawater desalination, and their technical expertise is in demand worldwide. In view of increasingly frequent droughts due to climate change, the extraction of drinking water using this technology is becoming a matter of survival for an increasing number of people.

Could the New Year's blaze in Crans-Montana that claimed 41 lives and left 116 people injured have been prevented?

New Year's celebrations ended in tragedy at the Le Constellation bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana. Swiss investigators believe that sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound insulation foam on the basement ceiling. The flames spread within seconds, turning the basement of the bar - a popular party location - into a death trap. 
41 people died as a result of the blaze and 116 people were left injured. Many of the mostly teenaged victims sustained severe burns. That night was the start of a living nightmare for the families affected. 
This documentary accompanies some of the parents whose children were left critically injured and now face long hospital stays far from home, uncertain outcomes and the daily struggle to keep hope alive. 
One young survivor also describes what she went through that night and how it has affected her. The psychological wounds run deep: anxiety, trauma and feelings of guilt. She is plagued by the question of why she survived when others died. 
The film shows how initial reactions of shock and dismay quickly turned to outrage after revelations that human blunders and safety shortcomings may have led to the blaze. The investigation and legal proceedings are only just getting underway, but the mental and emotional impact is already overwhelming.

--

In the 19th century, Scottish surgeon James Braid revolutionized the field of hypnotism, transitioning the practice towards inducing a sleep-like state. Today, hypnosis is used in psychiatry as a helpful medical tool, yet it still holds an entrancing place in popular fantasy. So, is there any truth to what it can accomplish? Or is it just illusion? Devin Terhune explores the power of suggestion.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law explores the core concepts of effect oriented programming with authors Bill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, and James Ward. The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.
The authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.

They share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like "monads" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.

Their goal? Overthrow the results of an election they claimed was rigged, despite no credible evidence of fraud. 

If that sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Brazil’s January 8 looked a lot like the January 6 attack on the US capital, just two years earlier: mob violence, an insurrection, and a defeated leader who refused to concede.

But the aftermath could not be more different. Jair Bolsonaro is now serving a 27-year prison sentence, while Donald Trump is president, again. 

So how did two democracies, facing similar threats, end up with such different outcomes? This video explains how Brazil’s democratic system worked to hold “the Trump of the Tropics” accountable and what the US could learn from the aftermath.

Nearly all of the most advanced chips are made in Taiwan, which China has threatened to annex. Concentrating chip supplies on an island that could be invaded, or face steep U.S. tariffs from Trump, is a big risk to Apple’s business.

To find out how far the company still has to go, WSJ reporter Rolfe Winkler visited several of the company’s suppliers including TSMC, ASML and Foxconn in the Southwest.

In the first episode we head to the High King’s of Ireland seat of power, the Hill of Tara, before investigating the Norman invasions and the powerful structures they built…castles! 

Matt begins at the Hill of Tara, or in Irish Teamhair or Cnoc na Teamhrach, an ancient site for projecting spiritual and political power. Matt reveals the mystical stories of the High King’s of Ireland, including the formative leader Brian Boru. But it’s not just Boru who has a direct link to Tara, one of Ireland’s most famous people is said to have come here…St Patrick. Patrick is believed to have performed miracles challenging the old pagan rulers, bringing christianity to the island of Ireland. Tara remains a magical place, even today. 

But Ireland wasn’t to be ruled by High Kings forever...In 1167 the Normans invaded. For years they fought for control. By 1176 they gained enough land to cement their power in stone…in castles! 

Matt heads to one of the biggest castles in Ireland, Trim. Trim sat on the frontier of Ireland, a symbol of English dominance over the Irish populace. It was built by the Norman Lord, Hugh De Lacy. De Lacy used Trim as his powerbase to control this area of Ireland through force and ideology. The Normans portrayed the Irish as barbaric people who they should conquer and ‘civilise’. Matt explores an incredible ancient manuscript that reveals exactly this. The Topographia Hibernica could be called the first piece of colonial propaganda in Ireland, aiming to justify the subjugation of of Irish land and people. But it wasn’t just through ideology and propaganda that the Normans could invade this green isle, it was the weapons and force they brought with them too - Matt discovers the brutal weapons that backed up their fortresses.

An invisible poison — lead — has been destroying lives in Zambia for decades.
 
Headaches, fatigue, stomach pain, memory loss — for many people in Kabwe, Zambia, all that is part of daily life. Children suffer the most. Lead damages their developing brains, slows learning and leaves scars that last a lifetime.

The cause is no mystery: An old lead mine. The United Nations ranks Kabwe among the most polluted places on Earth. Around 200,000 people are affected. Nearly every child has dangerously high levels of lead in their blood.

We met mothers like Jane, whose 6-year-old daughter Elizabeth struggles to keep up at school because of lead poisoning. Former workers, too: Like Mathias, who spent decades working without protections in the mine and now speaks of a toxic legacy no one wants to clean up.

Over 30 years since the mine closed, the damage continues. Families are living with irreversible harm, while a class-action lawsuit seeks to finally answer a simple question: Who is responsible?

Two days later, demonstrations had been largely stamped out, the country was in a communications blackout, and thousands of protesters had been killed.

Four witnesses to the protests share firsthand testimony of how a popular uprising turned into scenes of terror. Their accounts, along with videos verified by The Wall Street Journal and analysis from weapons and ammunition experts, offer a chronology of 48 hours of violence.

DESCRIPTION
In this conversation, Sarah Wells and Nick Selby explore why the current rush to adopt AI tools introduces significant business risks. They discuss how AI vendors deliberately blur security terminology to confuse buyers, how AI tools' insatiable appetite for data creates enormous blast radii when breaches occur, and what organizations can do to adopt AI responsibly - from threat modeling and cross-disciplinary governance to minimum-permission principles and incident readiness.

What started as a countercultural practice has become a productivity hack and a billion-dollar app ecosystem. On one level, it’s great that more people are meditating. But somewhere along the way, the whole thing got flattened. When mindfulness is mainly about optimizing your output, we’ve probably missed the point.

Today’s guest is Jon Kabat-Zinn, pioneer of the American mindfulness movement and author of the mega-bestseller Wherever You Go, There You Are. Jon’s work helped bring meditation into medicine, schools, sports, and everyday life. He’s also spent decades reminding people that mindfulness isn’t about escape, self-improvement, or becoming some perfectly serene version of yourself.

Sean and Jon talk about what mindfulness actually is, why being present is so damn hard, and what happens when industry turns meditation into another tool for self-optimization.

This episode originally aired in December of 2023.

Host: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)
Guest: Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life.

00:00 Intro
03:02 Mindfulness vs. mindlessness
13:12 What to do when you have a lapse in attention
19:36 The mindfulness industry
34:10 Recognizing this moment
36:46 A meditation led by Jon Kabat-Zinn

But a number of projects offer assistance and encouragement. Affordable housing, social networking, and childcare services are designed to ease the burden.

Single parents in Europe can increasingly rely on help and support from people, associations, and institutions to help them balance raising children with work, financial issues, and mental overload. 

"A secure, affordable living situation - that's such a key issue in the lives of single parents,” says Sarah Zeller. A few years ago, she found herself confronting this issue when, along with another friend and her child, she decided to set up a shared apartment for the two single parent families. But they searched in vain for an affordable apartment with enough space. 

This predicament gave rise to an innovative approach. In 2015, the German native founded the non-profit association JUNO in Vienna. Working with property developers, the association plans and develops compact and affordable apartments for single parents. With her idea, the founder has now helped over 160 families find a suitable apartment. 

The Belgian region of Wallonia has set itself the goal of strengthening the social position of single parents. Amandine Dedoncker is a social worker involved in the "Relais Familles Mono” program, creating services tailored to the needs of single parents. The government program enables single parents to learn practical skills, meet other mothers or fathers, and be part of a community. As a population group particularly affected by loneliness, this is extremely important for single parents‘ mental health. 

When other families have free time, on Saturdays Bianka Baumann is at work: in a supermarket in Rostock. The single mother and sales assistant works weekends. But who looks after her son Linus, during a time when most daycare centers are closed? An innovative daycare center here makes her weekend work possible by offering overnight care for parents who work night shifts. 
All of this is financed by the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A model that supports single parents - and makes it possible to truly balance work and family life.

This documentary explores the remarkable life of the woman who served as the longest-serving Princess of Wales and eventually Queen Consort to King Edward VII.

While the Edwardian era is often remembered for its lavish parties and the "Marlborough House Set," Alexandra’s private reality was defined by her battle with progressive deafness and the "Alexandra Limp"—a physical disability caused by rheumatic fever that, bizarrely, became a viral fashion trend among the Victorian elite. From her "rags-to-riches" journey as a Danish princess to her complicated marriage to a "Playboy King," we reveal how she navigated his high-profile mistresses (including Alice Keppel) and the strict demands of Queen Victoria.

Newly evaluated archive material, eyewitnesses, and experts document the extent, background, and consequences of this warfare.

A little-known chapter of colonial violence: The French army secretly used chemical weapons against independence fighters during the Algerian War (1954-1962). Maps, documents, and eyewitness accounts from French and Algerian veterans document the dimension of this warfare, as well as the human suffering it caused. 

Interviews with experts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons explain how military and political decision-makers organized these secret attacks. In addition to the torture and displacement of entire population groups, the use of chemical weapons constituted a huge breach of France's international obligations. Obligations France deliberately disregarded during its colonial war. 

Step by step, the film reveals the impact of this warfare on Algeria’s land and people. The film illuminates both the historical events, and their current relevance.

This video explores the 2026 "Deep Freeze" of the crypto market, analyzing why the "digital gold" thesis has failed to protect investors as Bitcoin lags behind the S&P 500 total returns. We dive into the "Victory Paradox"—the irony that Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance through Wall Street ETFs and a "crypto-friendly" presidency has tethered it to traditional financial risks, destroying its status as an uncorrelated asset. From the $12 billion losses at Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and the liquidity crisis at institutional prime broker BlockFills to the Great AI Pivot in the mining industry, we break down the structural traps currently paralyzing the ecosystem. Featuring insights on "Financial Nihilism" from Demetri Kofinas, the "Juggalo Theory" of crypto subcultures from Zeke Faux, and the massive migration toward prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, we ask the ultimate forward-looking question: now that Bitcoin is fully financialized, will it ever be an independent asset again?

His sphere of influence included top political officials, CEOs, corporate executives, finance managers, and even a member of the British royal family. How did he manage it? It turns out it was by establishing an elaborate network of influence and access that went well beyond the norms and expectations of the rich and famous.

What were the tipping points that nearly brought Epstein to justice in the 14 years before his first conviction and his final 2019 arrest? What were the structures and systems that failed to stop him from abusing and exploiting young women and girls in those 14 years? In this episode, we tick through the guest lists and institutions that continued to profit from relationships with Jeffrey Epstein — and which helped him remain free, in turn.

We will also talk about many of the conspiracy theories that have popped up since the latest tranche of Epstein documents came out. Was Epstein a national security asset? Did he actually kill himself?

Independent journalist Tara Palmeri, author of the Red Letter Substack and host of The Tara Palmeri Show, argues that conspiracies are important to help the public understand the extent and scope of the Epstein scandal — since for so long, so much about the story was covered up. We’ll make sense of which conspiracies have validity and which are tinfoil hat material, in this interview with a journalist who has long advocated for and written about the Epstein survivors.

We know that ICE was created in 2003. So what exactly do they mean by that? To unpack this claim, Vox producer Nate Krieger examines the history of immigration enforcement in the US. 

The story of American immigration is one of gradual change. Over time, the role of the immigration services slowly changed, morphing from an agency that managed labor and benefits to one that saw itself as law enforcement, with a focus on national security. 

And with that shift came a growth in capacity. The first federal immigration agency was created in 1891 with a total staff of 4 people. Today, with ICE, that number is over 22,000.

So how did immigration restrictions and enforcement change over the span of American history? By examining the centuries of events that culminated in the creation of ICE, we can begin to understand the context that created this modern agency.

This is a remastered version of our Ice Age video from July 2025. We've made a few changes, but apologies if you've watched the video already! 

In this video, we’re travelling back to Earth's frozen past, to discover what our planet was like during the Ice Age. What massive creatures dominated these icy landscapes, and what caused their extinction? We'll also ask a chilling question: could it happen again? Join us as we explore the rise and fall of Earth's frozen past and look for the warning signs of its return.
