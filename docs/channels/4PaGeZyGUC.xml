DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law explores the core concepts of effect oriented programming with authors Bill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, and James Ward. The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.
The authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.

They share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like "monads" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.

This full-length biography documentary explores the man behind the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the David sculpture, and some of the most powerful religious art ever created.

From his harsh upbringing in Florence to his rise as the most sought-after artist in Renaissance Italy, this Michelangelo documentary reveals the struggles, obsessions, and rivalries that shaped his masterpieces. Discover how he battled popes, princes and patrons, endured exhausting physical labour on the Sistine Chapel, and pushed sculpture and painting to new extremes.

Learn the secrets of Michelangelo’s artistic techniques, his revolutionary understanding of human anatomy, and the deep faith and inner turmoil that drove his greatest works. We uncover the politics of the Vatican, the pressures of working for powerful popes, and the personal cost of his relentless pursuit of perfection.

If you’re interested in Renaissance history, art history, Catholic Church history, or in-depth biography documentaries, this Michelangelo film is for you.

Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!

Mumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.

Reporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.
  
But change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.

Radhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.

But not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.
 
Mumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.

As the ocean warms, heat waves with the power to kill off coral are becoming more frequent and extreme. To help, a team of scientists, engineers, and other experts — backed by nearly $300 million — have mounted an enormous effort to try to help the reef withstand climate change over the next few decades. Will it be enough to keep the reef alive, considering an entire economy depends on it?

Senior environmental correspondent Benji Jones traveled down under in December to see some of their work in action. You can read more about what he learned here: https://www.vox.com/climate/475447/australia-great-barrier-reef-climate-change-restoration

The Emmy Award-winning documentary “The Luanda Leaks” — part of a worldwide investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that drew on a trove of more than 700,000 leaked documents — revealed how Isabel dos Santos made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks in part to her father’s longtime control of Angola’s government.

Despite a history of favorable deals with the Angolan government, dos Santos said she made her fortune on her own merit — and that corruption charges that were levied against her were part of a politically motivated “witch hunt.”

As part of the ICIJ’s reporting, 120 journalists from 36 media organizations in 20 countries spent months examining and verifying dos Santos’ leaked financial and business records, and revealed a paper trail of how she benefited from her position — and how big-name American accounting and consulting firms helped make it possible.

Talk of the US acquiring, or perhaps even seizing, the world's largest island with its vast mineral wealth has been causing concern not only among Greenlanders.

Denmark is outraged, as Greenland — a former colony — is still a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish Realm. But for how long? Many Greenlanders want to take control of their own future.
Nukannguaq Zeeb was born on the island and feels deeply connected to the island’s cultural traditions of hunting and fishing. He also coaches Greenland’s national soccer team, a sport introduced by Danish colonialists. He’s critical of Denmark’s ongoing influence. "To be honest, we are currently under Danish rule and not an independent country,” he says. Trump's neocolonial ambitions came as a shock to him.

Greenland did not gain any autonomy until 1953, when it became a Danish district. To this day, it remains closely associated with Denmark, both politically and economically. Many Greenlanders are pinning their hopes on the rich natural resources still hidden beneath the ice. As global warming accelerates, they could soon become accessible — drawing attention not only from the US administration.

The White Mountain mine lies north of the capital Nuuk and can only be reached by boat or helicopter. International investors are extracting anorthosite, a mineral used to produce insulation material and glass fiber, among other things.

Niels Ole is one of the few Greenlandic foremen in the mine — many skilled workers here come from abroad. Greenland’s weak education system means that many young people drop out before graduating. Social worker Ane Pipaluk looks after them. They live in shared housing and often come from families struggling with unemployment and alcoholism.

Negotiating a path between old and new dependencies poses a major challenge for Greenland. Niels Ole dreams of more autonomy for his homeland. He says, "It's the dream of many Greenlanders.”

--

Jo the First is a ruthless dictator who rules with an iron fist. To most onlookers, his rule appears cruel and unjust. But for his beloved son JoJo, this life is all he’s ever known and he grows up to inherit his father’s role and style of rule. Given JoJo’s unusual upbringing, does he bear full moral responsibility for his actions? Michael Vazquez and Sarah Stroud dig into this ethical dilemma.

Lesson by Michael Vazquez and Sarah Stroud, directed by Skirmanta Jakaitė, Art Shot.

DESCRIPTION
Olimpiu Pop speaks with Andrew Lamb, staff engineer at InfluxData and PMC member of Apache DataFusion and Apache Arrow, about how modern data systems are built using standardized open source components rather than being developed from scratch.

Andrew discusses the FDAP Stack (Flight, DataFusion, Arrow & Parquet), the shift from row-based to columnar data storage, and how technologies like Apache Iceberg are enabling a new era of interoperability across data platforms. The discussion covers why this modular approach saves years of development time while providing better performance and compatibility.

ABSTRACT
Agents are changing the way GenAI applications are built and has become a fundamental building block between data & LLMs. With a widely accepted standard like MCP, it is set to take off exponentially in the coming months/years. Agents by design are event-driven and are naturally fit into Serverless architecture.

In this session we explore how Serverless can be a huge part of empowering the upcoming Agentic revolution & why this combination is such a killer! [...]

In a highly unusual move - the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.

We also take a closer look at the "agents of chaos" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the "shadow" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the "Miran Limbo" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a "banana republic" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.

They harvest herbs by the roadside and grow wild vegetables in cracks in the concrete. For these modern foragers and hunters, the food is free, tasty and more varied than in the supermarket.

Christian Amys is an urban foraging professional. He forages for fresh food in his hometown of Brighton. For him, the English coastal city is an urban Garden of Eden. Christian finds wild vegetables and herbs in places where most people would never expect to find food. The 42-year-old only spends a few pounds a week on food from the supermarket: "I want to be independent and don't like to rely on the supermarket. I like to forage on my doorstep because it's nice to know where my food comes from."

Christian Amys worked as a top chef for 20 years before becoming an urban forager. Today, he shows others where to find wild fennel, hogweed, pineapple weed and dandelion heads and how to use them in food preparation. Christian now even supplies top restaurants and cocktail bars with his wild delicacies.

Alexis Goertz also looks for her food on the roadside and in parks. The Canadian has lived in Berlin for over 10 years. She preserves what she collects using the centuries-old technique of fermentation. Whether it's evening primrose capers, wild garlic kimchi or goutweed sauerkraut - for Alexis, fermentation is about more than just preservation: "Above all, fermentation makes food tastier and easier to digest. And I've just become addicted to it."

Alexis regularly invites people to join her on urban herb walks and explains what’s edible - and what’s poisonous. The 33-year-old is all about rediscovering nature in the city: "Berlin is fantastic for foraging for food. The diversity is immense. Not just among the people, but also in nature."

This diet consists mainly of plant-based ingredients like vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fruits with a moderate amount of fish and dairy products.  

The food we eat has a big influence on our health as it is one of the leading causes of chronic diseases. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), nearly half of all American adults now live with diet-related chronic diseases.   

More than half the average diet in the U.S. now consists of ultra-processed food. But for some younger, lower-income communities, ultra-processed food can typically make up as much as 80% of their diet.

Pour bien démarrer l'année 2026, je vous propose un épisode spécial et 100% en français de la French Cooking Academy,  pour vous emmener dans l'univers de la pâtisserie française. Aujourd'hui, on s'attaque à un classique indémodable : la crème frangipane, le cœur de notre célèbre Galette des Rois ! 👑

🌟 Key Ingredients | Les Ingrédients Clés 🌟

🥛 For the Pastry Cream (Crème Pâtissière)
200 ml whole milk 🥛
2 egg yolks 🥚
50 g sugar
10 g cornstarch (Maïzena)
10 g plain flour
1/2 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp vanilla extract for ease!) ✨
Kirsch (optional, for that unique aromatic touch!) 🍒

🧈 For the Almond Cream (Crème d’Amande)
100 g soft butter (room temperature, like a pomade) 🧈
100 g sugar
100 g eggs (about 2 medium, room temperature) 🥚
100 g ground almonds / almond meal 🌰
A few drops of bitter almond extract (this stuff is potent, use sparingly!)
1 tsp flour (optional, for extra stability)

🌰 The Almond Cream Secrets | Les Secrets de la Crème d’Amande 🤫
3 Golden Rules for Perfection!
Temperature is Key! 🌡️ Make sure both your butter and eggs are at room temperature. This is crucial for a smooth emulsion!
Cream it Right! Start by creaming the soft butter until pale. Then, gradually beat in the sugar, followed by the eggs, little by little. Get ready for a beautifully smooth mix! 🥣
Fold Gently! Gently fold in your sifted almond meal and those precious drops of bitter almond extract. Don't overmix!
Chill Out! Pop it in the fridge to chill until you're ready to assemble. 

👑 Assembly & Baking | Assemblage & Cuisson 👑
It's time to bring it all together for your masterpiece!
Loosen Up! Take your cold pastry cream and loosen it with a splash of Kirsch. Then, gently fold it into your almond cream until everything is beautifully combined. Voilà, your frangipane is ready!
Fill & Seal! Grab your puff pastry, generously fill it with the frangipane (psst... don't forget the fève if you're making a real Galette des Rois! ). Then, seal those edges really well to keep all that deliciousness inside!

Final touches: 
 Give your creation a beautiful egg wash for that golden shine, decorate as you like, and then let it rest in the fridge for 20 minutes. This helps the pastry hold its shape! ✨
Bake to Perfection! Preheat your oven to a hot 200 °C / 390 °F and bake for 30–40 minutes until deeply golden brown and puffed up! Keep an eye on it! oven

Même si ma galette a eu un petit "accident" esthétique (trop généreux en crème !), le goût est DIVIN ! Ne vous inquiétez pas si la vôtre n'est pas parfaite, l'important c'est le plaisir ! 😋

Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most important leaders in modern history. In this full biography documentary, we explore the life, legacy and assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the most famous voice of the American civil rights movement. 

From his childhood in segregated America to his rise as a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, this video tells the complete story of Martin Luther King Jr.
Discover how MLK led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Birmingham Campaign and the March on Washington, where he delivered the iconic “I Have a Dream” speech. We examine his philosophy of nonviolent protest, his relationship with other civil rights activists, and his battles against racism, segregation and injustice in the United States.

This Martin Luther King Jr. documentary also looks at the FBI surveillance of MLK, the events leading to his assassination in Memphis in 1968, and the impact of his death on American history and the global struggle for civil rights and equality.

If you’re interested in history documentaries, civil rights, Black history and the life of Martin Luther King Jr., this in-depth biography is for you.

Angkor was once the largest city of the medieval world, home to nearly a million people, and at its center stood Angkor Wat, one of the most ambitious architectural projects in human history. In this episode, we explore how Angkor rose under kings like Suryavarman II and Jayavarman VII, how its vast temples, cities, and water systems were built, and what ultimately led to its collapse. From religious fusion and monumental engineering to climate disaster, invasion, and mythmaking, this is the story of how a thriving metropolis became one of the world’s most iconic ruins and a lasting symbol of Cambodia.

The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was scattered across 12 square kilometers. Evidence of a war crime that remains unpunished to this day.

On July 17, 2014, the Malaysian Boeing 777 with flight number MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The plane was shot down by a Russian BUK missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine, where war broke out in 2014. 

This documentary reflects on the tragedy of MH17. The film consists of archive material, intercepted telephone conversations, open-source material, excerpts from television broadcasts, and staged fictional episodes. By combining different materials into a comprehensive collage, the film sheds light on the crash and examines the connections between propaganda, justice, punishment, and the far-reaching consequences of actions. 

While the film revolves around the story of MH17, it also approaches the subject on a very personal level — including a meeting with a Dutch relative of one of the victims on the plane. By making connections to what is happening in Ukraine today, the film sheds light on the global repercussions of this crime. 

The film views the tragic events of July 17, 2014 from different perspectives and at different points in time, linking the crimes of the past with the present.

By the late 1950s, it was becoming clear to Soviet naval planners that the United States was winning the battle beneath the world’s oceans.

Over the previous decade, American engineers had developed sophisticated silencing technologies that made the latest generation of submarines so stealthy, they could track Soviet subs for hours, and sometimes days, without being detected. For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.

Simply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.

Faced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.

In 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.
It wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.

When Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.

But Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.
