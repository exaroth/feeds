You‚Äôll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.

In this video, we explore how China‚Äôs dominance in rare earth elements has become a powerful geopolitical tool‚Äîand why the United States is struggling to catch up. From the Mountain Pass mine in California to Apple‚Äôs $500 million recycling push, we unpack the strategic importance of rare earths in everything from electric vehicles and smartphones to fiber optics and missile systems.
We also look at the recent Trump‚ÄìXi summit, the temporary truce on export controls, and the deeper tensions that remain unresolved. Why are rare earths so hard to substitute? How does China‚Äôs export licensing regime work? And what happens if the U.S. gets cut off?

üîç Topics covered:

Rare earths in global supply chains
China‚Äôs export controls and licensing strategy
U.S. efforts to rebuild domestic production
Military vs civilian demand for rare earths
Recycling, substitution, and strategic stockpiling

Some countries have switched to ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù donation systems, where everyone is a potential donor unless they say otherwise, but studies show that policy changes alone aren‚Äôt enough. Real progress also depends on better transplant coordination, healthcare resources, and open conversations about donation wishes.

Some were physically attached to interstellar spacecraft, while others were beamed into space in the form of radio signals. This video provides a detailed chronology of almost all of these messages with a focus on their meaning and improbability of reception.

This comprehensive biography explores one man's incredible journey through the hardship of the Cultural Revolution, to become one of the most powerful people in the world as the Supreme Leader of China.

From his early life in Liangjiahe to his political rise through the provinces (Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai), we trace the key moments that shaped his governance. Learn about the seismic shifts defining the Xi Jinping era: the massive Anti-Corruption Campaign ("Tigers and Flies"), the abolition of term limits (2018), and the codification of Xi Jinping Thought in the constitution.

Globally, Xi Jinping is known as the architect of the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a new Silk Road connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa. Domestically, his focus has been on Common Prosperity, tightening regulations on the Chinese tech sector (Alibaba, Tencent), and major military reforms of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).

Our video examines the crucial geopolitical challenges: the South China Sea, Hong Kong National Security Law, and the intensifying tensions with the United States over Taiwan and trade. Understand the Chinese Dream and the pursuit of a global superpower status under the fifth generation of Chinese leadership. Don't miss this essential look at the modern history of the People's Republic of China (PRC).

You might have heard of TRAPPIST-1. Discovered in 2017, this system of rocky planets orbiting a red dwarf star has been hailed as the most promising place to search for life outside our solar system. 

And now, one of these planets has just got even more exciting. New observations from the James Webb Telescope reveal the most compelling evidence yet: planet TRAPPIST-1e might have an Earth-like atmosphere. Join us to see what JWST found and why this could be huge.

While the Moldovan capital Chi≈üinƒÉu tends to pursue a more pro-European course, many people in Transnistria cling to Russia ‚Äì despite problems like Transnistria's deep poverty. The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures. 

Until the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act ‚Äì as some 80 percent of Transnistria's exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region.  

While pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU.

In 1996 the American political scientist Samuel Huntington published "The Clash of Civilisations and the remaking of the world order". Largely dismissed at the time of publication, and mostly mocked by students in the fields of Political Science and IR, the book has nevertheless remained relevant. From various figures in the MAGA movement to a new generation of rightwing politicians in Europe, Huntington's theory of a world in conflict between different civilisations defined by different cultures, continues to be cited in proposals of policy and to set the agendas.

In this video I examine Huntington's theory of a clash of civilisations caused by differences in culture, and try my best to present you with a critique.

Narcissist. You‚Äôve probably heard these terms used a lot more frequently in recent years. They‚Äôre pop psychology terms, also known as therapy-speak, and they‚Äôve become increasingly common in our mainstream vernacular. But oftentimes, people misuse the terminology and let it serve as a blanket term for more complex thoughts and feelings, making it more difficult to receive proper mental health support for clinical diagnoses. Vox correspondent Allie Volpe explains why therapy-speak is so alluring, and how to use more words, not fewer, to describe a situation.

They explore the horrifying life at sea for a Royal Navy sailor from the 16th to 19th century, covering the truth about press ganging, shipboard discipline, and the myths vs. realities of naval life.

Dan details the real killers at sea, revealing that more sailors died from disease like scurvy and in catastrophic shipwrecks than in famous naval battles. The conversation also covers the cosmopolitan nature of the crews, the horrors of naval combat, the complex truth about pirates, and what it really took to survive in Nelson's Navy.

It‚Äòs one of the toughest training programs run by the Foreign Legion. In the 3rd Regiment, legionnaires and the special units of friendly armies are trained under particularly harsh conditions.

The soldiers camp in the rainforest, food is rationed and there are no sanitary facilities. Unconditional obedience is mandatory, and even the smallest mistakes are severely punished. 
The 3rd Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (3e R√©giment √âtranger d'Infanterie) has been stationed in French Guiana since 1973. It is a region that consists of 90 percent forest and is one of the rainiest areas in the world - inhospitable conditions for both the legionnaires and their equipment. 
The fight against illegal gold prospecting is known as the "Harpie mission". Legionnaires comb through the rainforest before sunrise, often in the pouring rain, to track down the prospectors, who are organized in mafia-like structures and sometimes heavily armed.
A second mission in French Guiana is called "Titan". In this mission, legionnaires protect the international spaceport in Kourou. They have been carrying out this task since 2008.  
At the training center, the CEFE (Centre d'entra√Ænement en for√™t √©quatoriale), legionnaires as well as soldiers from friendly armies are trained in combat. There are usually around 40 participants on a course, most of whom do not make it to the end. Injuries occur on a daily basis and many participants drop out due to total exhaustion or dehydration. The documentary accompanies a legionnaire and a female officer candidate in the French military as they face increasingly tough challenges every day, which repeatedly push them to their physical and mental limits. The documentary offers insights into a world that is very rarely seen by outsiders.

DESCRIPTION
Maurice Naftalin and Stuart Marks discuss the second edition of "Java Generics and Collections", published 19 years after the original. The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.

They delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.

From state-of-the-art incinerators to mushrooms that eat construction material and an effort to clean one of the world‚Äôs most sacred rivers, they are changing the narrative to show how waste is actually a valuable raw material.

Soon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel‚Äôs remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù 

Kimmel‚Äôs suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC‚Äôs actions left many questioning whether Kimmel‚Äôs First Amendment rights were violated.

This incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the ‚Äúinalienable right‚Äù to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.
