DESCRIPTION
Maurice Naftalin and Stuart Marks discuss the second edition of "Java Generics and Collections", published 19 years after the original. The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.

They delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.

But maybe how we define waste should be rethought, treating it instead as an untapped resource. In this episode of An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau travels the world to meet people transforming waste into creation. From state-of-the-art incinerators to mushrooms that eat construction material and an effort to clean one of the world’s most sacred rivers, they are changing the narrative to show how waste is actually a valuable raw material.

Soon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel’s remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 

Kimmel’s suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC’s actions left many questioning whether Kimmel’s First Amendment rights were violated.

This incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the “inalienable right” to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.

The project is rising on Al Marjan Island, a man-made archipelago in the northernmost emirate, Ras Al Khaimah. Some experts question the project’s long-term prospects and wonder whether competition from tourism powerhouses like Dubai and Abu Dhabi could hurt this new casino.

WSJ examines the megaproject and examines whether building a casino in a deeply conservative society could be a massive mistake.

They have to climb 3,000 meters and cross rivers and glaciers. Known as Alpine transhumance, this tradition has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  

With 1,400 sheep, Markus and his colleagues make the journey from South Tyrol to Austria every spring. Like his ancestors, Markus spends the whole summer taking care of the animals in the alpine meadows.  

But they can't make a living from farming alone. Shepherds need to find other sources of income or even change jobs altogether. Still, they say what matters to them is that the next generation can carry on this tradition.

More and more families and schools are setting clear boundaries to counter the constant distraction of social media.

Studies have linked excessive smartphone use to depression, anxiety, and difficulties concentrating. This documentary follows several families and schools that greatly restrict smartphone use for children and young people. Martin and Ursula Novotny in Sevelen, Switzerland, are convinced that phones and social media are just as addictive as alcohol or drugs. They waited until their children were older before giving them a cell phone of their own. The Lyceum Alpinum boarding school in Switzerland is equally strict: During the day, all devices remain locked away; older students get their cell phones back after class, while younger students only get them for two hours in the evening. The result: The children are significantly less distracted in class and have actual conversations at breaktime. How much screen time is healthy, and at what age does it make sense to give a child a smartphone? Child and adolescent psychotherapist Nady Mirian explains which parental rules work for social media. The schools and families featured in the documentary are not opposed to new technologies, but they advocate responsible use. Is it still realistic for children today to grow up without a smartphone — and could it actually be preferable?

--

Long ago, a temple was built near the site of a naval battle that concluded the long and gruesome conflict known as the Genpei Wars. For centuries after, performers throughout the country honored this tragic past in beautiful, haunting performances. But the most skilled storyteller of all was a monk from this very temple. Jeffrey Angles digs into the Japanese legend of Hōichi the earless.

DESCRIPTION
When FundApps exploded from 20 to 50+ engineers in just one year, their old "everyone does support" model crumbled spectacularly. Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.

Flavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.

The twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!

Medieval historian Dr Hetta Howes (author of Poet, Mystic, Widow, Wife) reacts to Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, separating Hollywood fantasy from medieval sources. We explore the facts behind the fiction, from the opening battle's elephants to that David Beckham cameo.

We dive into the film's biggest changes: Arthur's brothel upbringing, the conflation of Excalibur with the Sword in the Stone, and the "weird snake sirens" that replace the Lady of the Lake. Dr Hetta Howes explains the real medieval stories of Uther Pendragon, Vortigern, Igraine, and the true origins of the Round Table.
