The recent Greenland crisis at Davos 2026 has shattered transatlantic trust, forcing Europe to confront a terrifying new reality: the need for strategic autonomy from the United States. Faced with what it views as transactional coercion, Brussels is readying an arsenal of economic countermeasures, ranging from a "trade bazooka" targeting U.S. tech firms to the highly publicized "financial nuclear option"—the threat of dumping trillions in U.S. Treasuries. But before we panic about a bond market collapse, we need to examine the hard financial realities: Is weaponizing sovereign debt a viable strategy, or is it merely a macroeconomic suicide pact? This video dives into the mechanics of this potential economic war and the high cost of moving from an era of global efficiency to one of fearful autarky

Its unique ecosystem is threatened with destruction. Despite objections, politicians and entrepreneurs are allowing hydroelectric power plants to be built here. But resistance to the plans remains strong.

Over the past millennia, the Neretva has developed into a globally unique ecosystem. It is home to animal and plant species that exist nowhere else. But the "Blue Heart of Europe,” as the Neretva is also known, is threatened with collapse.

Politicians and entrepreneurs see new power plants as opportunities to generate sustainable energy — and rake in big money. Local residents and scientists, on the other hand, have serious doubts about the projects. This is because the construction of a dam changes the natural environment forever.

Boban Škrtar lives a few kilometers above the planned main dam in the village of Ulog. On the riverbank, he explains the devastating impact of the construction project to date: "Everything here used to be forest. It was cleared for the dam, and you can see that now everything is destroyed. There used to be a swimming area and a campsite there, but now everything is gone forever."
On the other side of the dam, Austrian aquatic ecologist Kurt Pinter is searching for the softmouth trout—a fish thought to live in just four river systems, including the Neretva. His hope is that if the softmouth trout is declared an endangered endemic species in this part of the river system, the construction of some 70 new power plants along the Neretva may be prevented.

We trace his role in politics, foreign policy, empire, industry, the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the creation of the modern constitutional monarchy.

This history documentary dives into the emotional core of Victoria and Albert’s marriage – devotion, control, jealousy, grief – and shows how that private obsession had huge consequences for Britain and the wider world. See how Albert fought scandal, hostile ministers and anti-German prejudice while building a new royal role based on duty, respectability and progress.
Ideal for viewers interested in the Victorian era, British royal history, European monarchy, 19th century politics and character-driven history documentaries.

The psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor began recording the stories of other survivors in the late 1970s. This is a film about the power of listening.

When Dori Laub began recording the stories of other survivors in the late 1970s, he was preserving memory. But he was also pioneering a radical act of listening. He recognized the power of listening to life stories as a way of helping survivors cope with trauma. His work led to the creation of the world’s first video testimony archive and shaped a unique therapeutic approach centered on presence, empathy, and witness.  

The documentary follows the final four years of Laub’s life (2015-2018), interweaving powerful archival testimonies with intimate glimpses into his own story: a childhood in Romanian camps, a love affair with the daughter of a former Nazi officer, and the moment his own children hear his testimony for the first time. His legacy echoes today in the work of Edut 710, a project inspired by Laub’s methods to document the voices of survivors of the October 7 Hamas massacre.

Thousands of immigration officers are patrolling the streets of Minneapolis, leading to the death of one anti-ICE protester, Renee Nicole Good, and setting off a massive swirl of protests. 

Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis late this week — showing his support for law enforcement, and sending a political message at the same time: that this White House is doubling down on its war against blue cities, and Minneapolis specifically.

Now, President Trump has subpoenaed the state’s top Democratic officials, alleging they were impeding federal immigration enforcement actions. The Justice Department has promised to arrest anyone who impedes the immigration enforcement actions, and a Trump official accused some state officials of “terrorism.” With Minnesota now in a full-blown conflict with the Trump administration, the Democratic state leadership is front and center in the standoff.

In this video episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, host Astead Herndon interviews Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the Somali fraud scandal that first brought on the ICE surge in his state. Did Democratic officials do enough to staunch the fraud? What more could they have done to cut the fraud off at its knees? And now that ICE is in Minnesota, what more can they do? Are the courts the only recourse, if President Trump does as he has been threatening, and invokes the Insurrection Act?

And now, it’s headed to the Supreme Court in a case called Trump v. Barbara.

For well over 100 years, birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution,with the understanding that anyone born on US soil is granted citizenship. 

But in Trump v. Barbara, the administration claims that the law applies to those who are not just born in the United States but also “owe allegiance” to it.

The plaintiffs represent a group of people affected by Trump’s executive order, and their argument is simple: Leave birthright citizenship alone.

In the summer of 1776, the largest expeditionary army in British history arrives off New York to crush the American rebellion once and for all.

Facing the full might of the British Empire, the Continental Army fights desperately to hold New York. But after a series of defeats, General Washington struggles to hold together his forces. Then, in the Revolution's darkest hour, he decides to risk everything to turn back the tide.

It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. Researchers are developing concepts for life on water - on a grand scale. Initial tests are promising. Is success a genuine possibility?

Over half of humanity lives near the coast. But in many places, flooding is a constant threat, forcing entire populations to search for new habitats. Paradoxically, these could be located directly on the water. 

Cities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. International research has long been developing concepts for life on water. Now, new designs — from temporary huts to affordable student dormitories to smart high-tech villas — seem to hold promise. Could huge numbers of people soon be living in "floating cities”?

This futuristic living concept could have some real perks. Artificial islands can adjust to changing water levels. Modular city ‘fleets’ can change location like ships. Flexible floating neighborhoods can expand or move closer together. Efficient water management systems could supply the city with food and energy. 

But where floating cities drop anchor, questions arise: What laws do they fall under? What about environmental protection? How do they interact with the ecosystem? And how can they be protected from tsunamis? The search for answers has led to the creation of floating homes in Copenhagen and the Maldives; smart islands in the heart of Seoul; and the world's first underwater greenhouse. 

One thing is certain: in the face of climate change, we need to rethink our urbanized way of life. Will we succeed in making "floating cities” innovative, safe, and sustainable? Could we soon be experiencing a "blue revolution”?

The city's formidable walls, over 50 feet high and defended by 60,000 inhabitants, posed a massive challenge. Starved of resources after a grueling march, the Crusaders turned to innovative siege warfare: massive wooden siege towers.

These wheeled behemoths, up to 60 feet tall, were constructed from scavenged timber, including dismantled ships from Jaffa. Covered in animal hides soaked in vinegar to resist fire arrows and Greek fire, the towers shielded archers and allowed troops to approach the walls undetected. The Crusaders built three: one for Raymond's southern assault and two for Godfrey's northern push.

On July 13-14, after failed initial attacks, the towers rolled forward under cover of night. Godfrey's tower, repositioned stealthily, reached the northwest wall at dawn on July 15. From its top platform, knights like Lethold of Tournai leaped onto the battlements using a drawbridge, overwhelming defenders. This breach allowed Crusaders to pour in, leading to the city's fall after 40 days of siege. The victory resulted in a brutal massacre, claiming up to 70,000 lives, and established the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Siege towers exemplified medieval engineering, turning a desperate siege into a triumph. They overcame Jerusalem's defenses through mobility, protection, and height, symbolizing the Crusaders' determination and tactical ingenuity in their quest to reclaim the Holy City.

This is work I’ve been talking about for years, and I’ve promised myself that 2026 is the year I stop planning and start doing.

The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan was supposed to be a quick show of force to pacify the country and install a more Moscow-friendly leadership for the Afghan communist regime. But the 40th Army (officially "Limited Contingent of Soviet Troops in Afghanistan") soon found themselves embroiled in a counter insurgency which they weren't prepared for. The tactical successes and increasingly brutal methods against the guerilla mujahedeen tactics didn't win hearts and minds of the Afghan population, however.

DESCRIPTION
Apache Spark contributor Holden Karau discusses the evolution of distributed data processing, the challenges of integrating machine learning with big data tools, and the technical complexities of working with GPUs at scale.

The conversation takes a personal turn as Holden reveals her latest project: an open-source AI tool that helps people appeal health insurance claim denials. Drawing from personal experiences with denied claims, she has built a system that trains on independent medical review data to generate effective appeals, making it freely available at https://fighthealthinsurance.com while grappling with the classic open-source challenge of sustainable funding.

If it is a bubble and it pops, the consequences for everyone may be dire. 

If it turns out that AI is a bubble and it does indeed pop as many are warning, the consequences for everyone may be dire. Bloomberg Originals explains how circular deals between AI players figure into what’s being called the “wager to end them all.”

The universe thrums with quantum fields; and the particles of matter and force emerge as vibrational manifestations of the deep symmetries of these fields. The layers and reflections of those symmetries give us the wonderful richness of what we call the standard model of particle physics. Except there seems to be something missing: the sterile neutrino.
