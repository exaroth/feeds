What started as using AI for tedious chores — meal plans, grocery lists, quick research — quietly morphed into hours talking to a chatbot. And Adam isn’t alone. As chatbots get better at flattery, emotional support, and companionship, researchers are seeing more users (including teens) slip into dependency without realizing it.

Adam unpacks how chatbots are designed to keep us coming back, why young people are especially vulnerable, and what happens when adults can’t walk away — in some cases, leading to severe mental health crises.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

The soldier, who went by the call sign “Sheva,”  was part of the Ukrainian platoon at the heart of "2000 Meters to Andriivka," the new feature documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Academy Award-winning team behind "20 Days in Mariupol."

Weaving together quiet moments of reflection, like this one with Sheva, and vivid battle footage, "2000 Meters to Andriivka" documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. The film follows Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade as it carries out a grueling, meter-by-meter counteroffensive that aims to retake the strategic Ukrainian town of Andriivka from Russia -- and as the soldiers realize that for them, the war may never end.

Sheva would be killed in a battle and die in a hospital five months after this scene was filmed. Read more about Sheva's story at pbs.org/frontline, and watch the full documentary on @frontline starting Nov. 25, 2025.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko; is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater; and is executive produced by Raney Aronson-Rath and the AP's Derl McCrudden. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.

Located near Changi Airport, this massive vault can store up to 500 tons of gold, worth about $64 billion. But why are people increasingly turning towards Singapore to store their wealth?

The WSJ secured rare access inside one of the world’s largest bullion valts–part of Singapore’s drive to become a global gold hub.

The number of people in Poland abusing this powerful painkiller is growing. There have been dozens of fatalities.

Michal lives in a small town south of Gdansk. Because of the stigma surrounding people with addiction, he prefers to remain anonymous. Every two weeks, he travels to Święciec to take methadone, a substitute drug, at the addiction clinic of the psychiatric hospital. After using various drugs, he started taking fentanyl, the strongest of all opiates. 
Fentanyl is used to treat people with severe pain and as an anesthetic. Addicts remove the gel from pain patches and inject it directly into their bloodstream. There have been dozens of fatal overdoses in Poland. Michal has also lost one of his close friends. Corrupt pharmacists are believed to have sold large quantities of fentanyl patches to dealers. The authorities have since put a stop to this.  
In Żuromin, Jadwiga Karpinska lost her son Pawel to a fatal overdose. Their town, a two-hour drive from the capital Warsaw, was known as the country’s unofficial fentanyl capital in 2024. That changed when police detained a well-known local dealer. The drug continues to be available there, but in smaller quantities.
Elementary school teacher Adam Ejnik believes in prevention. He wants to keep his students away from the drug by raising awareness about its dangers. 
Artur from Łódź has managed to get off fentanyl. A few years ago, he was so addicted, he had lost the will to live. Today, his girlfriend Agnieszka helps him stay clean. His goal: he hopes to finish his psychology degree and work as a therapist to help other addicts get off the extremely powerful drug.

--

The kola nut is the seed of the kola tree, a small evergreen native to the forests of West Africa, where it’s long been integral to the cultural fabric of many communities. So, how did this sacred ingredient end up all around the world? And how did it make its way into the original recipe of a drink that billions of people consume every day? Shantel George explores the bitter history of kola nuts.

Trees are among the most extreme and successful forms of life on Earth. They build their bodies from thin air, move water with pressures that would crush a human, and grow using a fascinating system of living cables wrapped in layers of corpses. Under their bark lies a razor-thin strip of living cells, working endlessly to move water hundreds of meters, build indestructible wood, and coordinate millions of functions. 
How do trees work, and what are they even made of? What makes these ancient giants so resilient, and maybe even immortal?

Many women feel unsafe in public spaces, whether on streets, at train stations, or in parks. The danger they face overwhelmingly comes from men: Around 95% of sexualized violence in public spaces is committed by them. 

Yanni Gentsch's encounter with a stranger who secretly filmed her while she jogged in a forest in Cologne went viral on the internet after she recorded the confrontation. Her experience demonstrates a common and recurring problem.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law discusses their book "Facilitating Software Architecture" and how traditional architecture approaches often become bottlenecks that slow down high-performing development teams.

Rather than architects making top-down decisions in isolation, they advocate for a facilitation approach centered on the "advice process".

This collaborative method shifts the architect's role from decision-maker to conversation facilitator. The approach has proven successful even in traditional corporate environments, ultimately creating more maintainable code bases where development teams actually enjoy working and can respond effectively to changing requirements.

from the Oscar®-winning team behind “20 Days in Mariupol.”

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. Following his historic account of the civilian toll in Mariupol, Ukrainian filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov turns his lens towards Ukrainian soldiers — who they are, where they came from, and the impossible decisions they face in the trenches as they fight for every inch of their land.

The documentary follows a Ukrainian brigade battling through approximately one mile of a heavily fortified forest on their mission to liberate the Russian-occupied village of Andriivka amid a failing counteroffensive in 2023. 

Weaving together original footage, intensive Ukrainian Army bodycam video and powerful moments of reflection with haunting intimacy, the documentary reveals how the farther the soldiers advance through their destroyed homeland, the more they realize that, for them, this war may never end.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko, and is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lost Ancient Civilisation Brought To Life In Assassins Creed Origins</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijXT787G2cM</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ijXT787G2cM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 19:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered what life was like in the sun-soaked streets of ancient Cyrene?

DESCRIPTION
Olimpiu Pop speaks with Andrew Lamb, staff engineer at InfluxData and PMC member of Apache DataFusion and Apache Arrow, about how modern data systems are built using standardized open source components rather than being developed from scratch.

Andrew discusses the FDAP Stack (Flight, DataFusion, Arrow & Parquet), the shift from row-based to columnar data storage, and how technologies like Apache Iceberg are enabling a new era of interoperability across data platforms. The discussion covers why this modular approach saves years of development time while providing better performance and compatibility.

The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.

Yemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.

The conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. 

A proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.

Following Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.
Between blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?

OpenAI has signed $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments, but how do they plan to pay for it? Are government subsidies and taxpayer-backed guarantees the next step? In this video, we dive into the financing gymnastics behind the AI revolution, the lobbying for federal support, and why tech firms are pitching AI as “too important to fail.”
We’ll cover:
✅ OpenAI’s $1.4 trillion data center buildout
✅ The push for government backstops and subsidies
✅ Nvidia’s warning on energy and capital constraints
✅ Why AI could strain power grids and utilities
✅ The risk of an AI “metabubble” and what it means for investors

The unlikely journey has brought hope to a country with rare reason to celebrate while illuminating the complex politics of the Taliban's relationship to cricket.

Cricket has grown into a vital part of life in Afghanistan - offering glimmers of joy and excitement to the countless Afghans that play and watch the game. And while the stunning achievements of the men's national team have fostered unity and hope, the Taliban's return to power means half of the country is barred from the festivities and many female players were forced to flee their homeland. 

In a crisis-ridden country like Afghanistan, cricketing success is both deeply meaningful to its people and a complex political challenge, presenting the Taliban government with an opportunity to use the sport at home and abroad. Cricket has offered star players like Gulbadin Naib a path from childhood refugee camps to international acclaim, while all over the country young players like Jamal Stanikzai dream of one day taking part in the team's success. For Afghan refugees like former women's national team player Firooza Amiri, cricket is both a beloved sport and a form of resistance. Deutsche Welle accompanies current and former players and fans in Afghanistan, Australia and Dubai to tell the intertwined stories of Afghan cricket.

For a long time, scientists believed insects acted mostly out of instinct and weren’t particularly intelligent, in part, because most of them only live for a few weeks. But it turns out, the insect world is far more complex than we previously thought.  

Many insect species have brains the size of a grain of rice, but are still able to store images, shapes, colors and experiences, and can even learn new skills and work with tools.  

In many species, individual insects even develop unique traits and personalities, like bravery or aggressiveness. One reason for this could be that species with diverse individuals can better adapt to environmental changes, giving them an evolutionary advantage for survival. 

Watch the full documentary “Smart insects - The astonishing intelligence of bumblebees, wasps & co.” on the DW Documentary YouTube channel.
