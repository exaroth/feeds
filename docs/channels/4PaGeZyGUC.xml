Thousands of immigration officers are patrolling the streets of Minneapolis, leading to the death of one anti-ICE protester, Renee Nicole Good, and setting off a massive swirl of protests. 

Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis late this week — showing his support for law enforcement, and sending a political message at the same time: that this White House is doubling down on its war against blue cities, and Minneapolis specifically.

Now, President Trump has subpoenaed the state’s top Democratic officials, alleging they were impeding federal immigration enforcement actions. The Justice Department has promised to arrest anyone who impedes the immigration enforcement actions, and a Trump official accused some state officials of “terrorism.” With Minnesota now in a full-blown conflict with the Trump administration, the Democratic state leadership is front and center in the standoff.

In this video episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, host Astead Herndon interviews Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the Somali fraud scandal that first brought on the ICE surge in his state. Did Democratic officials do enough to staunch the fraud? What more could they have done to cut the fraud off at its knees? And now that ICE is in Minnesota, what more can they do? Are the courts the only recourse, if President Trump does as he has been threatening, and invokes the Insurrection Act?

03:26 The DOJ going after Democratic state officials
07:38  Minneapolis protests against ICE
10:17 Trump's threat to impose the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis

And now, it’s headed to the Supreme Court in a case called Trump v. Barbara.

For well over 100 years, birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution,with the understanding that anyone born on US soil is granted citizenship. 

But in Trump v. Barbara, the administration claims that the law applies to those who are not just born in the United States but also “owe allegiance” to it.

The plaintiffs represent a group of people affected by Trump’s executive order, and their argument is simple: Leave birthright citizenship alone.

It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. Researchers are developing concepts for life on water - on a grand scale. Initial tests are promising. Is success a genuine possibility?

Over half of humanity lives near the coast. But in many places, flooding is a constant threat, forcing entire populations to search for new habitats. Paradoxically, these could be located directly on the water. 

Cities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. International research has long been developing concepts for life on water. Now, new designs — from temporary huts to affordable student dormitories to smart high-tech villas — seem to hold promise. Could huge numbers of people soon be living in "floating cities”?

This futuristic living concept could have some real perks. Artificial islands can adjust to changing water levels. Modular city ‘fleets’ can change location like ships. Flexible floating neighborhoods can expand or move closer together. Efficient water management systems could supply the city with food and energy. 

But where floating cities drop anchor, questions arise: What laws do they fall under? What about environmental protection? How do they interact with the ecosystem? And how can they be protected from tsunamis? The search for answers has led to the creation of floating homes in Copenhagen and the Maldives; smart islands in the heart of Seoul; and the world's first underwater greenhouse. 

One thing is certain: in the face of climate change, we need to rethink our urbanized way of life. Will we succeed in making "floating cities” innovative, safe, and sustainable? Could we soon be experiencing a "blue revolution”?

The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan was supposed to be a quick show of force to pacify the country and install a more Moscow-friendly leadership for the Afghan communist regime. But the 40th Army (officially "Limited Contingent of Soviet Troops in Afghanistan") soon found themselves embroiled in a counter insurgency which they weren't prepared for. The tactical successes and increasingly brutal methods against the guerilla mujahedeen tactics didn't win hearts and minds of the Afghan population, however.

DESCRIPTION
Apache Spark contributor Holden Karau discusses the evolution of distributed data processing, the challenges of integrating machine learning with big data tools, and the technical complexities of working with GPUs at scale.

The conversation takes a personal turn as Holden reveals her latest project: an open-source AI tool that helps people appeal health insurance claim denials. Drawing from personal experiences with denied claims, she has built a system that trains on independent medical review data to generate effective appeals, making it freely available at https://fighthealthinsurance.com while grappling with the classic open-source challenge of sustainable funding.

If it is a bubble and it pops, the consequences for everyone may be dire. 

If it turns out that AI is a bubble and it does indeed pop as many are warning, the consequences for everyone may be dire. Bloomberg Originals explains how circular deals between AI players figure into what’s being called the “wager to end them all.”

The universe thrums with quantum fields; and the particles of matter and force emerge as vibrational manifestations of the deep symmetries of these fields. The layers and reflections of those symmetries give us the wonderful richness of what we call the standard model of particle physics. Except there seems to be something missing: the sterile neutrino.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law explores the core concepts of effect oriented programming with authors Bill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, and James Ward. The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.
The authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.

They share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like "monads" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.

This full-length biography documentary explores the man behind the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the David sculpture, and some of the most powerful religious art ever created.

From his harsh upbringing in Florence to his rise as the most sought-after artist in Renaissance Italy, this Michelangelo documentary reveals the struggles, obsessions, and rivalries that shaped his masterpieces. Discover how he battled popes, princes and patrons, endured exhausting physical labour on the Sistine Chapel, and pushed sculpture and painting to new extremes.

Learn the secrets of Michelangelo’s artistic techniques, his revolutionary understanding of human anatomy, and the deep faith and inner turmoil that drove his greatest works. We uncover the politics of the Vatican, the pressures of working for powerful popes, and the personal cost of his relentless pursuit of perfection.

If you’re interested in Renaissance history, art history, Catholic Church history, or in-depth biography documentaries, this Michelangelo film is for you.

Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!

Mumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.

Reporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.
  
But change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.

Radhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.

But not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.
 
Mumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.

As the ocean warms, heat waves with the power to kill off coral are becoming more frequent and extreme. To help, a team of scientists, engineers, and other experts — backed by nearly $300 million — have mounted an enormous effort to try to help the reef withstand climate change over the next few decades. Will it be enough to keep the reef alive, considering an entire economy depends on it?

Senior environmental correspondent Benji Jones traveled down under in December to see some of their work in action. You can read more about what he learned here: https://www.vox.com/climate/475447/australia-great-barrier-reef-climate-change-restoration

The Emmy Award-winning documentary “The Luanda Leaks” — part of a worldwide investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that drew on a trove of more than 700,000 leaked documents — revealed how Isabel dos Santos made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks in part to her father’s longtime control of Angola’s government.

Despite a history of favorable deals with the Angolan government, dos Santos said she made her fortune on her own merit — and that corruption charges that were levied against her were part of a politically motivated “witch hunt.”

As part of the ICIJ’s reporting, 120 journalists from 36 media organizations in 20 countries spent months examining and verifying dos Santos’ leaked financial and business records, and revealed a paper trail of how she benefited from her position — and how big-name American accounting and consulting firms helped make it possible.
