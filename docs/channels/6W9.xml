They are covered in fish skin — specifically strips of sterilized tilapia.Doctors here are testing the skin of the popular fish as a bandage for second- and third-degree burns. The innovation arose from an unmet need. Animal skin has long been used in the treatment of burns in developed countries. But Brazil lacks the human skin, pig skin, and artificial alternatives that are widely available in the US.The three functional skin banks in Brazil can meet only 1 percent of the national demand, said Dr. Edmar Maciel, a plastic surgeon and burn specialist leading the clinical trials with tilapia skin.As a result, public health patients in Brazil are normally bandaged with gauze and silver sulfadiazine cream."It's a burn cream because there's silver in it, so it prevents the burns from being infected," said Dr. Jeanne Lee, interim burn director at the the regional burn center at the University of California at San Diego. "But it doesn't help in terms of debriding a burn or necessarily helping it heal."The gauze-and-cream dressing must be changed every day, a painful process. In the burn unit at Fortaleza's José Frota Institute, patients contort as their wounds are unwrapped and washed.Enter the humble tilapia, a fish that's widely farmed in Brazil and whose skin, until now, was considered trash. Unlike the gauze bandages, the sterilized tilapia skin goes on and stays on.The first step in the research process was to analyze the fish skin."We got a great surprise when we saw that the amount of collagen proteins, types 1 and 3, which are very important for scarring, exist in large quantities in tilapia skin, even more than in human skin and other skins," Maciel said. "Another factor we discovered is that the amount of tension, of resistance in tilapia skin is much greater than in human skin. Also the amount of moisture."In patients with superficial second-degree burns, the doctors apply the fish skin and leave it until the patient scars naturally. For deep second-degree burns, the tilapia bandages must be changed a few times over several weeks of treatment, but still far less often than the gauze with cream. The tilapia treatment also cuts down healing time by up to several days and reduces the use of pain medication, Maciel said.Antônio dos Santos, a fisherman, was offered the tilapia treatment as part of a clinical trial after he sustained burns to his entire right arm when a gas canister on his boat exploded. He accepted."After they put on the tilapia skin, it really relieved the pain," he said. "I thought it was really interesting that something like this could work."The initial batches of tilapia skin were studied and prepared by a team of researchers at the Federal University of Ceará. Lab technicians used various sterilizing agents, then sent the skins for radiation in São Paulo to kill viruses, before packaging and refrigerating the skins. Once cleaned and treated, they can last for up to two years.In the US, animal-based skin substitutes require levels of scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration and animal rights groups that can drive up costs, Lee said. Given the substantial supply of donated human skin, tilapia skin is unlikely to arrive at American hospitals anytime soon.But it may be a boon in developing countries."I'm willing to use anything that might actually help a patient," Lee said. "It may be a good option depending on what country you're talking about. But I also think the problem is that you need to find places that have the resources to actually process the skin and sterilize it, and make sure it doesn't have diseases."In Brazil, in addition to the clinical trials, researchers are currently conducting histological studies that compare the composition of human, tilapia, pig, and frog skins. They are also conducting studies on the comparative costs of tilapia skin and conventional burn treatments. If clinical trials show continued success, doctors hope a company will process the skins on an industrial scale and sell it to the public health system.This article is reproduced with permission from STAT.

At a high level, ERS projects average total costs per acre to increase for every crop in 2026, underscoring the persistence of elevated production expenses across U.S. agriculture. When operating expenses and farm-wide costs like equipment, land and management are combined, costs vary widely by crop. In 2025, forecasted total per-acre costs are $1,308 for rice, $1,166 for peanuts, $943 for cotton, $890 for corn, $658 for soybeans, $498 for oats, $491 for barley, $443 for sorghum, and $396 for wheat. Looking ahead, ERS projections for 2026 suggest continued upward pressure across most cost categories, with total cost increasing anywhere from 2.2% to 3.3%. Amongst the nine principal crops, wheat ($409 per acre), sorghum ($458) and oats ($513) remain at the lower end of the production cost spectrum, while soybeans ($678) and barley ($507) fall in the mid-range in 2026. Cotton ($965), peanuts ($1,194) and rice ($1,336) remain the most expensive crops to produce on a per-acre basis. Operating costs—expenses directly tied to producing a yearly crop, such as seed, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel and labor—substantially vary across crops. In 2025, total operating costs ranged from $155 per acre for wheat to more than $764 per acre for rice and $631 per acre for peanuts. In 2026, these costs are expected to rise, ranging from $774 per acre for rice and $160 per acre for wheat. While select inputs have moderated slightly from recent peaks, overall operating expenses remain well above pre-2021 levels. Rising costs since 2020 have been driven primarily by sharp increases in interest expenses (+71%), fertilizer (+37%), fuel and oil (+32%), labor (+47%), chemicals (+25%) and maintenance (+27%), alongside notable gains in seed (+18%) and marketing costs (+18%). Losses Persist Even After FBA and ECAP Against this backdrop of elevated costs, commodity prices have remained under pressure, limiting farmers’ ability  to cover  their costs through the marketplace alone. As a result, many farms are projected to experience losses for a fourth or fifth consecutive year, even after accounting for crop insurance indemnities and ad hoc assistance. The  Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) Program and the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) provide important near-term support. However, ECAP was designed to address 2023 and 2024 losses, rather than 2025 and later production challenges. For both programs, payments are calculated on a per-acre basis. However, when compared to current per-acre production costs and weak commodity prices, these payments generally cover only a share of losses rather than restore profitability. In fact, returns over total costs for all nine principal row crops are projected to remain negative on a per-acre basis even after accounting for federal assistance. Based on loss calculations used in the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program, rice producers face losses of roughly $210 per acre, followed by cotton ($202), oats ($159), peanuts ($131), sorghum ($91), corn ($87), wheat ($70), soybeans ($61) and barley ($42). In total, net losses across the sector are estimated to exceed $50 billion over the past three crop years.For many farms, aid helps slow the erosion of working capital but does not fully offset negative margins. As a result, producers continue to absorb multiyear losses that strain balance sheets, tighten cash flow and complicate access to operating credit. These loss estimates reflect national averages; actual costs of production and returns vary by region, management decisions and ownership structure. For example, producers who own their farmland may face lower total costs by avoiding cash rental expenses, resulting in higher returns.Additionally, neither the FBA program nor the ECAP address losses in the specialty crops market. The 2024 Marketing Assistance for Specialty Crop Program (MASC) provided a first but limited relief step for growers and, for many, represented some of the first federal assistance tied to market challenges in the sector. Specialty crop growers continue to face deep and persistent economic losses driven by rising input costs, tightening margins, weather and disease disruptions, labor expenses and constraints, and global trade instability — challenges shared by field crop agriculture, including producers of crops beyond the nine principal crops, such as alfalfa and sugar beets. Strengthening support for all sectors of agriculture is an economic necessity. Doing so will help maintain a resilient, accessible and diverse U.S. food system. ERS cost projections make clear that input costs for all of the nine principal row crops remain elevated and sticky. Continued increases in both operating and overhead expenses are pushing breakeven prices higher, while commodity prices remain insufficient to offset those costs for many producers. While FBA and ECAP payments are an important and welcome step in addressing near-term financial stress, they do not fully close the gap between costs and returns. As farmers enter the 2026/27 marketing year, accumulated losses — estimated to exceed $50 billion across the sector over the past three crop years — continue to weigh on farm finances. These estimates reflect national average conditions and are calculated ahead of the growing season, before producers make final planting, input and marketing decisions. In practice, farmers respond to market signals by adjusting crop mix, input use and risk management strategies as conditions evolve. While outcomes vary widely by region and operation, persistently elevated breakeven prices underscore the importance of market-driven solutions that strengthen domestic demand — such as year-round access to E15 — to help support commodity prices and improve farm margins. Much-needed safety net enhancements through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) are expected to take effect in October 2026, but those changes do not address the pressures farmers face today. In a recent letter to Congress organized by the American Farm Bureau Federation and signed by 56 agricultural organizations, farm groups warned of an economic crisis in rural America, citing multiyear losses driven by record-high input costs and historically low commodity prices. Congressional leaders from both parties have acknowledged the severity of these losses and the need for additional aid to stabilize farm finances. Until longer-term policy improvements take hold, many operations remain caught between high operating costs and low commodity prices, underscoring the ongoing financial strain facing U.S. agriculture as producers weigh whether they can afford to plant another crop. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections</title><link>https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/</link><author>WaitWaitWha</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:11:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Signed by a group of 21 computer scientists expert in election securityScientists have understood for many years that internet voting is insecure and that there is no known or foreseeable technology that can make it secure. Still, vendors of internet voting keep claiming that, somehow, their new system is different, or the insecurity doesn’t matter. Bradley Tusk and his Mobile Voting Foundation keep touting internet voting to journalists and election administrators; this whole effort is misleading and dangerous. All internet voting systems are insecure. The insecurity is worse than a well-run conventional paper ballot system, because a very small number of people may have the power to change any (or all) votes that go through the system, without detection. This insecurity has been known for years; every internet voting system yet proposed suffers from it, for basic reasons that cannot be fixed with existing technology.Internet voting systems known as “End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting” are also insecure, in their own special ways.  Recently, Tusk announced an E2E-VIV system called “VoteSecure.”  It suffers from all the same insecurities.  Even its developers admit that in their development documents.  Furthermore, VoteSecure isn’t a complete, usable product, it’s just a “cryptographic core” that someone might someday incorporate into a usable product. Recent announcements by Bradley Tusks’s Mobile Voting Foundation suggest that the development of VoteSecure somehow makes internet voting safe and appropriate for use in public elections.  This is untrue and dangerous.  All deployed Internet voting systems are unsafe, VoteSecure is unsafe and isn’t even a deployed voting  system, and there is no known (or foreseeable) technology that can make Internet voting safe.Part I.  All internet voting systems are insecureInternet voting systems (including vote-by-smartphone) have three very serious weaknesses:Malware on the voter’s phone (or computer) can transmit different votes than the voter selected and reviewed. Voters use a variety of devices (Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac) which are constantly being attacked by malware.Malware (or insiders) at the server can change votes. Internet servers are constantly being hacked from all over the world, often with serious results.Malware at the county election office can change votes (in those systems where the internet ballots are printed in the county office for scanning). County election computers are not more secure than other government or commercial servers, which are regularly hacked with disastrous results. Although conventional ballots (marked on paper with a pen) are not perfectly secure either, the problem with internet ballots is the ability for a single attacker (from anywhere in the world) to alter a very large number of ballots with a single scaled-up attack.  That’s much harder to do with hand-marked paper ballots; occasionally people try large-scale absentee ballot fraud, typically resulting in their being caught, prosecuted, and convicted.Part II.  E2E-VIV internet voting systems are also insecureYears ago, the concept of “End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting” (E2E-VIV) was proposed, which was supposed to remedy some of these weaknesses by allowing voters to check that their vote was recorded and counted correctly.  Unfortunately, all E2E-VIV systems suffer from one or more of the following weaknesses:Voters must rely on a computer app to do the checking, and the checking app (if infected by malware) could lie to them.Voters should not be able to prove to anyone else how they voted – the technical term is “receipt-free” – otherwise an attacker could build an automated system of mass vote-buying via the internet. But receipt-free E2E-VIV systems are complicated and counterintuitive for people to use.It’s difficult to make an E2E-VIV checking app that’s both trustworthy and receipt-free. The best solutions known allow checking only of votes that will be discarded, and casting of votes that haven’t been checked; this is highly counterintuitive for most voters! The checking app must be separate from the voting app, otherwise it doesn’t add any malware-resistance at all.  But human nature being what it is, only a tiny fraction of voters will do the extra steps to run the checking protocol.  If hardly anyone uses the checker, then the checker is largely ineffective.Even if some voters do run the checking app, if those voters detect that the system is cheating (which is the purpose of the checking app), there’s no way the voters can prove that to election officials.  That is, there is no “dispute resolution” protocol that could effectively work.Thus, the problem with all known E2E-VIV systems proposed to date is that the “verification” part doesn’t add any useful security: if a few percent of voters use the checking protocol and see that the system is sometimes cheating, the system can still steal the votes of all the voters that don’t use the checking protocol. And you might think, “well, if some voters catch the system cheating, then election administrators can take appropriate action”, but no appropriate action is possible: the election administrator can’t cancel the election just because a few voters claim (without proof) that the system is cheating!  That’s what it means to have no dispute resolution protocol.Part III. VoteSecure is insecureIt has been the scientific consensus for decades that internet voting is not securable by any known technology. Research on future technologies is certainly worth doing. However, the decades of work on E2E-VIV systems has yet to produce any solution, or even any hope of a solution, to the fundamental problems.Therefore, when it comes to internet voting systems, election officials and journalists should be especially wary of “science by press release.” Perhaps some day an internet voting solution will be proposed that can stand up to scientific investigation. The most reliable venue for assessing that is in peer-reviewed scientific articles. Reputable cybersecurity conferences and journals have published a lot of good science in this area. Press releases are not a reliable way to assess the trustworthiness of election systems.(affiliations for for identification only and do not indicate institutional endorsement), Eugene Higgins Professor Emeritus of Computer Science, Princeton University, Percy K. and Vida L.W.

See the latest evolution in the Contagious Interview campaign.At the end of last year, Jamf Threat Labs published research related to the Contagious Interview campaign, which has been attributed to a threat actor operating on behalf of North Korea (DPRK). Around the same time, researchers from OpenSourceMalware (OSM) released additional findings that highlighted an evolution in the techniques used during earlier stages of the campaign.Specifically, these newer observations highlight an additional delivery technique alongside the previously documented ClickFix-based techniques. In these cases, the infection chain abuses Microsoft Visual Studio Code task configuration files, allowing malicious payloads to be executed on the victim system.Following the discovery of this technique, both Jamf Threat Labs and OSM continued to closely monitor activity associated with the campaign. In December, Jamf Threat Labs identified additional abuse of Visual Studio Code  configuration files. This included the introduction of dictionary files containing heavily obfuscated JavaScript, which is executed when a victim opens a malicious repository in Visual Studio Code.Jamf Threat Labs shared these findings with OSM, who subsequently published a more in-depth technical analysis of the obfuscated JavaScript and its execution flow.Earlier this week, Jamf Threat Labs identified another evolution in the campaign, uncovering a previously undocumented infection method. This activity involved the deployment of a backdoor implant that provides remote code execution capabilities on the victim system.At a high level, the chain of events for the malware look like so:Throughout this blog post we will shed light on each of these steps.In this campaign, infection begins when a victim clones and opens a malicious Git repository, often under the pretext of a recruitment process or technical assignment. The repositories identified in this activity are hosted on either GitHub or GitLab and are opened using Visual Studio Code.When the project is opened, Visual Studio Code prompts the user to trust the repository author. If that trust is granted, the application automatically processes the repository’s configuration file, which can result in embedded arbitrary commands being executed on the system.On macOS systems, this results in the execution of a background shell command that uses  in combination with  to retrieve a JavaScript payload remotely and pipe it directly into the Node.js runtime. This allows execution to continue independently if the Visual Studio Code process is terminated, while suppressing all command output.In observed cases, the JavaScript payload is hosted on , a platform that has been increasingly used in recent DPRK-related activity following a move away from other hosting services, as previously documented by OpenSourceMalware.Jamf Threat Labs reported the identified malicious repository to GitHub, after which the repository was removed. While monitoring the activity prior to takedown, we observed the URL referenced within the repository change on multiple occasions. Notably, one of these changes occurred after the previously referenced payload hosting infrastructure was taken down by Vercel.Once execution begins, the JavaScript payload implements the core backdoor logic observed in this activity. While the payload appears lengthy, a significant portion of the code consists of unused functions, redundant logic, and extraneous text that is never invoked during execution (SHA256: 932a67816b10a34d05a2621836cdf7fbf0628bbfdf66ae605c5f23455de1e0bc). This additional code increases the size and complexity of the script without impacting its observed behavior. It is passed to the node executable as one large argument.Focusing on the functional components, the payload establishes a persistent execution loop that collects basic host information and communicates with a remote command-and-control (C2) server. Hard-coded identifiers are used to track individual infections and manage tasks from the server.Core backdoor functionalityWhile the JavaScript payload contains a significant amount of unused code, the backdoor's core functionality is implemented through a small number of routines. These routines provide remote code execution, system fingerprinting, and persistent C2 communication.Remote code execution capabilityThe payload includes a function that enables the execution of arbitrary JavaScript while the backdoor is active. At its core, this is the main functionality of this backdoor.This function allows JavaScript code supplied as a string to be dynamically executed over the course of the backdoor lifecycle. By passing the function into the execution context, attacker-supplied code can import additional Node.js modules allowing additional arbitrary node functions to be executed.System fingerprinting and reconnaissanceTo profile the infected system, the backdoor collects a small set of host-level identifiers:This routine gathers the system hostname, MAC addresses from available network interfaces, and basic operating system details. These values provide a stable fingerprint that can be used to uniquely identify infected hosts and associate them with a specific campaign or operator session.In addition to local host identifiers, the backdoor attempts to determine the victim’s public-facing IP address by querying the external service ipify.org, a technique that has also been observed in prior DPRK-linked campaigns.Command-and-control beaconing and task executionPersistent communication with the C2 server is implemented through a polling routine that periodically sends host information and processes server responses. The beaconing logic is handled by the following function:This function periodically sends system fingerprinting data to a remote server and waits for a response. The beacon executes every five seconds, providing frequent interaction opportunities.The server response indicates successful connectivity and allows the backdoor to maintain an active session while awaiting tasking.If the server response contains a specific status value, the contents of the response message are passed directly to the remote code execution routine, mentioned prior.Further Execution and InstructionsWhile monitoring a compromised system, Jamf Threat Labs observed further JavaScript instructions being executed roughly eight minutes after the initial infection. The retrieved JavaScript went on to set up a very similar payload to the same C2 infrustructure.Review of this retrieved payload yields a few interesting details...It beacons to the C2 server every 5 seconds, providing its system details and asks for further JavaScript instructions.It executes that additional JavaScript within a child process.It's capable of shutting itself and child processes down and cleaning up if asked to do so by the attacker.It has inline comments and phrasing that appear to be consistent with AI-assisted code generation.This activity highlights the continued evolution of DPRK-linked threat actors, who consistently adapt their tooling and delivery mechanisms to integrate with legitimate developer workflows. The abuse of Visual Studio Code task configuration files and Node.js execution demonstrates how these techniques continue to evolve alongside commonly used development tools.Jamf Threat Labs will continue to track these developments as threat actors refine their tactics and explore new ways to deliver macOS malware. We strongly recommend that customers ensure Threat Prevention and Advanced Threat Controls are enabled and set to block mode in Jamf for Mac to remain protected against the techniques described in this research.Developers should remain cautious when interacting with third-party repositories, especially those shared directly or originating from unfamiliar sources. Before marking a repository as trusted in Visual Studio Code, it’s important to review its contents. Similarly, "npm install" should only be run on projects that have been vetted, with particular attention paid to package.json files, install scripts, and task configuration files to help avoid unintentionally executing malicious code.Dive into more Jamf Threat Labs research on our blog.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From stealth blackout to whitelisting: Inside the Iranian shutdown</title><link>https://www.kentik.com/blog/from-stealth-blackout-to-whitelisting-inside-the-iranian-shutdown/</link><author>oavioklein</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Iran is in the midst of one of the world’s most severe communications blackouts. This post uses Kentik data to detail how this historic event unfolded, where this event lies in the context of previous Iranian shutdowns, and finally discusses what might be in store next for Iran.For nearly two weeks, Iran has been enduring one of the most severe internet shutdowns in modern history. The theocratic regime’s decision to restrict communications coincided with a violent nationwide crackdown on a growing protest movement driven by worsening economic hardship.In this post, I explore the situation in Iran using Kentik’s aggregate NetFlow data, along with other sources.At the time of this writing, a near-complete internet shutdown has persisted for almost 14 days. Along with internet services, international voice calling has also been blocked (there have been a couple of periods when limited outgoing calls were allowed), and domestic communication services have experienced extended disruptions, including Iran’s National Information Network. For a country of 90 million people, the combined blocking of these communication modes makes this blackout one of the most severe in history.To learn more about the conditions that lead to the check out this special episode of Kentik’s Telemetry Now podcast with Iranian digital rights expert Amir Rashidi, Director of Digital Rights and Security at the human rights organization Miaan Group:For decades, the internet of Iran has been connected to the world via two international gateways:IPM, primarily a university and research network, was the country’s original internet connection in the 1990s, a story covered in the excellent book The Internet of Elsewhere by Cyrus Farivar. Years later, the state telecom TIC got into the business of providing internet service and today handles the vast majority of internet traffic into and out of Iran.Despite TIC’s dominance, IPM has maintained a technologically independent connection to the outside world, though it has never been immune from Iranian government censorship and surveillance. This distinction matters because each gateway behaved differently during the shutdown.In the days leading up to January 8, there were many reports of localized internet blockages around the country, but these incidents weren’t big enough to register on any of our national traffic statistics for Iran.The first major development occurred at 11:42 UTC on January 8, 2026, when TIC (AS49666) began withdrawing its IPv6 BGP routes from its sessions with other networks. Within hours, nearly all of Iran’s IPv6 routing had disappeared from the global routing table.However, based on our aggregate NetFlow, IPv6 traffic normally amounts to less than 1% of the overall traffic (in bits/sec) into Iran, so the average Iranian was unlikely to be affected by this issue. Regardless, the withdrawal of IPv6 routes appeared to be an early indication of what was to come later in the day.Following a brief disruption, we observed internet traffic levels begin to plummet at 16:30 UTC (7pm local). The drop continued until internet traffic into Iran had all but ceased by 1845 UTC, as illustrated below. It took over two hours to stop all internet traffic into and out of the country.At 19:00 UTC, we observed TIC disconnecting from a subset of its transit providers, including Russian state telecom Rostelecom (AS12389) and regional operator Gulf Bridge International (AS200612), and all of its settlement-free peers.Despite the loss of numerous BGP adjacencies for AS49666 (TIC), the vast majority of Iranian IPv4 routes continued to be routed globally. The drop in Iranian IPv4 traffic, therefore, could not be explained by reachability issues; another mechanism was at work at the network edge blocking traffic.Georgia Tech’s IODA tool captures this divergence well. In the below screenshot, active probing (blue) drops to zero as traffic is blocked, while routed IPv4 space in BGP (green) is almost completely unscathed (98.14%).Although IPv4 routes remained online, internet traffic stopped for roughly 90 million Iranians. This distinction is central to Iran’s next step: internet “whitelisting,” in which an Iranian version of the Chinese Great Firewall allows only approved users or services while blocking all others. Had authorities withdrawn IPv4 routes, as they did with IPv6, Iran would have become completely unreachable, as Egypt was in January 2011. By keeping IPv4 routes in circulation, Iranian authorities can selectively grant full internet access to specific users while denying it to the broader population.As mentioned above, the internet shutdown in Iran is not complete. There has been a tiny amount of traffic still trickling in and out as a small set of Iranians continue to enjoy internet access.From our data, we have also observed the emergence of a diurnal pattern of traffic to AS49666 emerge on January 13. AS49666 is not typically a major terminus for internet traffic to Iran, so this traffic is likely proxied traffic from whitelisted individuals or services.Evolving calculus of shutdowns in IranBack in 2012, Iran was in the beginning stages of building its National Information Network (NIN), ostensibly built to allow the country to continue to function in the event that it was cut off from the outside world. At the time, I teamed up with Iran researcher Collin Anderson to investigate. With access to in-country servers, we mapped Iran’s national internet from the inside (research published here).We found that the NIN had been implemented by routing RFC1918 address space (specifically 10.x.x.x) between Iranian ASes within the country. By doing so, they could be assured that devices connected to the NIN would not be able to receive connections from the outside world, as those IP addresses are not routable on the public internet.In 2019, I reported on Iran’s internet shutdown following the government’s decision to raise gas prices. At the time, it was the most severe shutdown in the country’s history—until this month. It involved withdrawing BGP routes of some networks while blocking traffic of others, and lasted for almost two weeks.Initial impacts of the 2019 Iranian internet shutdown in the Oracle Intelligence Map.Nightly traffic drops for Iranian mobile providers during Iran’s internet curfew in 2022.The article described internet curfews as another means of reducing the costs of shutdowns, not unlike the development of the NIN, according to Iranian digital rights expert Amir Rashidi. In that post, we wrote:The objective of internet curfews, like Iran’s NIN, is to reduce the cost of shutdowns on the authorities that order them. By reducing the costs of these shutdowns, they become a more palatable option for an embattled leader and, therefore, are likely to continue in the future.Timeline for the stages of the Iranian internet shutdown during the Twelve-Day War.The outage demonstrated Iran’s newfound ability to block traffic nationwide without manipulating BGP routes, signaling a higher level of sophistication in its internet filtering. This summer’s Stealth Blackout ultimately foreshadowed the ongoing shutdown Iran is now enduring.In the aftermath of the 2022 protests, Starlink began allowing connections from Iran. Satellite internet operators like Starlink must typically clear, at a minimum, two legal hurdles to operate in a country: a telecom license and radio spectrum authorization from the local government. Starlink has been operational in Iran for over three years at this point without either, and the Iranian government has taken note.The ITU Radio Regulations Board (RRB) is a quasi-judicial United Nations body that interprets and applies the Radio Regulations, to include satellite emissions. It exists to resolve disputes between countries and oversees compliance with the international radio frequency register, but, in the end, has no direct enforcement power.“Request the Administration of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue its efforts, to the extent possible, to identify and deactivate unauthorized STARLINK terminals in its territory,Strongly urge the Administration of Norway to take all appropriate actions at its disposal to have the operator of the Starlink system immediately disable unauthorized transmissions of its terminals within the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”Regardless of the decisions of this body, Starlink continues to operate in the country. (Note: The US and Norway share responsibility for Starlink’s ITU registration.)Other governments are watching, learningIn the decade and a half since the internet shutdowns of the Arab Spring, we’ve observed the practice of suppressing communications evolve as authoritarian governments learn tactics from one another. In the ongoing shutdown in Iran, multiple such tactics are on display.To mitigate the costs of its shutdown, the Iranian government has created an internal national internet and appears to be in the process of building a “whitelisting” system to allow certain individuals and services internet access while blocking the rest. If these measures successfully enable an unpopular Iranian government to remain in power, we can expect to see them replicated elsewhere.On the other side, the digital rights activists have also been building tools, funded in large part by the now-embattled Open Technology Fund, to allow communications to continue during a shutdown like this. However, no amount of circumvention tooling can restore service to 90 million people.The fight for open and free communications does not have an end. As long as authoritarian governments exist, this game of cat-and-mouse will continue. Ours is only to decide which side we’re on and to throw our support (financially and otherwise) to those working on solutions to these problems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lix – universal version control system for binary files</title><link>https://lix.dev/blog/introducing-lix/</link><author>onecommit</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:55:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI agents need version control beyond textChanges AI agents make need to be reviewable by humans.For code, Git solves this:: What exactly did the agent change?: Review, then merge or reject.: Undo mistakes instantly.But agents modify binary files too.

Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: TerabyteDeals – Compare storage prices by $/TB</title><link>https://terabytedeals.com/</link><author>vektor888</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:13:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>eBay explicitly bans AI &quot;buy for me&quot; agents in user agreement update</title><link>https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-bans-ai-agents-updates-arbitration-user-agreement-feb-2026/</link><author>bdcravens</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:07:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[eBay explicitly prohibits AI "buy for me" agents and LLM (larger language model) bots, updates arbitration and dispute resolution requirements in latest User Agreement update, going into effect February 20, 2026.The following summary of changes was provided in an email sent to users:We’ve updated eBay’s User Agreement, including the agreement to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us. Our updated User Agreement was posted on January 20, 2026. For users who agreed to a prior version of our User Agreement, this agreement is effective as of February 20, 2026.In this update, eBay is updating its anti-scraping prohibition to clarify that it specifically also includes bots used for AI or LLMs. eBay is also updating the agreement to arbitrate in the updated User Agreement:We clarified the scope of the class action waiver.We clarified the process for opting out of the agreement to arbitrate.We updated the physical address to which notices for informal dispute resolution, arbitration demands, and notices for opting out of arbitration must be sent.Disclaimer: comparisons are made using both automated and manual methods and are provided for informational purposes only - no warranty of completeness or accuracy is expressed or implied and users are advised to do their own due diligence.First, as the summary calls out, eBay is explicitly prohibiting AI "buy for me" agents and LLM scraping bots from interacting with the platform without permission from eBay.In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not......use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not...use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means (including, without limitation buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review) to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;The move comes after eBay quietly changed their robots.txt file with new guidance placing guardrails and restrictions on how AI agents interact with the site in December.It also comes on the heels of Amazon's controversial Buy For Me test which uses agentic AI to display items from direct merchant websites for sale through the Amazon app, even if the brand does not sell on Amazon themselves - raising concerns about transparency, consent, and control over how product details are displayed to buyers.While it appears that Amazon Buy For Me currently does pull inventory from other third party marketplaces, it would not be surprising if eBay is reacting at least in part to this and other agentic commerce news making recent headlines.Arbitration & Dispute ResolutionThe rest of the changes in this User Agreement update affect arbitration and dispute resolution.eBay's previous User Agreement update in May 2025 made significant changes to arbitration terms and limits on lawsuits, forcing users to give up their right to the sue the company in many situations.Notice to eBay should be sent by email to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020.Notice to eBay should be sent by email to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 339 W. 13490 S., Ste. 500, Draper, UT 84020Most importantly, eBay has expanded their arbitration clause which previously prohibited class actions to now also explicitly exclude more types of group legal actions.EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.

These samples included both the supportive extracellular matrix of the joint and cartilage-producing chondrocyte cells. When treated, the tissue began forming new, functional cartilage.Together, the findings suggest that cartilage lost due to aging or arthritis may one day be restored using either a pill or a targeted injection. If successful in people, such treatments could reduce or even eliminate the need for knee and hip replacement surgery.A Direct Attack on OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects about one in five adults in the United States and generates an estimated $65 billion each year in direct health care costs. Current treatments focus on managing pain or replacing damaged joints surgically. There are no approved drugs that can slow or reverse the underlying cartilage damage.The new approach targets the root cause of the disease rather than its symptoms, offering a potential shift in how osteoarthritis is treated.The Role of a Master Aging EnzymeThe protein at the center of the study is called 15-PGDH. Researchers refer to it as a gerozyme because its levels increase as the body ages. Gerozymes were identified by the same research team in 2023 and are known to drive the gradual loss of tissue function.In mice, higher levels of 15-PGDH are linked to declining muscle strength with age. Blocking the enzyme using a small molecule boosted muscle mass and endurance in older animals. In contrast, forcing young mice to produce more 15-PGDH caused their muscles to shrink and weaken. The protein has also been connected to regeneration in bone, nerve, and blood cells.In most of these tissues, repair happens through the activation and specialization of stem cells. Cartilage appears to be different. In this case, chondrocytes change how their genes behave, shifting into a more youthful state without relying on stem cells.A New Path to Tissue Regeneration"This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury," said Helen Blau, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. "We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It's very exciting."Blau, who leads the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology and holds the Donald E. and Delia B. Baxter Foundation Professorship, and Nidhi Bhutani, PhD, associate professor of orthopaedic surgery, are the study's senior authors. The research was published in . Mamta Singla, PhD, instructor of orthopaedic surgery, and former postdoctoral scholar Yu Xin (Will) Wang, PhD, served as lead authors. Wang is now an assistant professor at the Sanford Burnham Institute in San Diego.Dramatic Regeneration of Joint Cartilage"Millions of people suffer from joint pain and swelling as they age," Bhutani said. "It is a huge unmet medical need. Until now, there has been no drug that directly treats the cause of cartilage loss. But this gerozyme inhibitor causes a dramatic regeneration of cartilage beyond that reported in response to any other drug or intervention."The human body contains three main types of cartilage. Elastic cartilage is soft and flexible and forms structures such as the outer ear. Fibrocartilage is dense and tough, helping absorb shock in places like the spaces between spinal vertebrae. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and glossy, allowing joints such as the hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles to move with low friction. This type, also called articular cartilage, is the form most commonly damaged in osteoarthritis.Why Cartilage Rarely Grows BackOsteoarthritis develops when joints are stressed by aging, injury, or obesity. Chondrocytes begin releasing inflammatory molecules and breaking down collagen, the main structural protein in cartilage. As collagen is lost, cartilage becomes thinner and softer. Inflammation then leads to swelling and pain, which are hallmarks of the disease.Under normal conditions, articular cartilage has very limited ability to regenerate. While some stem or progenitor cells capable of forming cartilage have been identified in bone, similar cells have not been successfully found within articular cartilage itself.Connecting Aging, Prostaglandins, and RepairEarlier research from Blau's lab showed that prostaglandin E2 is essential for muscle stem cell function. The enzyme 15-PGDH breaks down prostaglandin E2. By blocking 15-PGDH or increasing prostaglandin E2 levels, researchers previously supported the repair of damaged muscle, nerve, bone, colon, liver, and blood cells in young mice.This led the team to question whether the same pathway might be involved in cartilage aging and joint damage. When they compared knee cartilage from young and old mice, they found that 15-PGDH levels roughly doubled with age.Regrowing Cartilage in Aging KneesResearchers then injected older mice with a small molecule that inhibits 15-PGDH. They first administered the drug into the abdomen to affect the entire body, and later injected it directly into the knee joint. In both cases, cartilage that had become thin and dysfunctional with age thickened across the joint surface.Additional tests confirmed that the regenerated tissue was hyaline cartilage rather than the less functional fibrocartilage."Cartilage regeneration to such an extent in aged mice took us by surprise," Bhutani said. "The effect was remarkable."Protecting Joints After ACL-Like InjuriesThe team observed similar benefits in mice with knee injuries resembling ACL tears, which often occur during sports involving sudden stopping, pivoting, or jumping. Although such injuries can be surgically repaired, about half of affected people develop osteoarthritis in the injured joint within 15 years.Mice that received twice-weekly injections of the gerozyme inhibitor for four weeks after injury were far less likely to develop osteoarthritis. In contrast, animals given a control treatment had double the levels of 15-PGDH compared with uninjured mice and developed osteoarthritis within four weeks.Treated mice also moved more normally and placed more weight on the injured leg than untreated animals."Interestingly, prostaglandin E2 has been implicated in inflammation and pain," Blau said. "But this research shows that, at normal biological levels, small increases in prostaglandin E2 can promote regeneration."Reprogramming Cartilage Cells Without Stem CellsCloser analysis showed that chondrocytes in older mice expressed more genes linked to inflammation and the conversion of cartilage into bone, along with fewer genes involved in cartilage formation. Treatment shifted these patterns.One group of chondrocytes that produced 15-PGDH and cartilage-degrading genes dropped from 8% to 3%. Another group associated with fibrocartilage formation declined from 16% to 8%. A third population, which did not produce 15-PGDH and instead expressed genes tied to hyaline cartilage formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, rose from 22% to 42%.These changes indicate a broad return to a more youthful cartilage profile without involving stem or progenitor cells.Evidence From Human Cartilage SamplesThe researchers also tested cartilage taken from patients undergoing total knee replacement for osteoarthritis. After one week of treatment with the 15-PGDH inhibitor, the tissue showed fewer 15-PGDH-producing chondrocytes, reduced expression of cartilage degradation and fibrocartilage genes, and early signs of articular cartilage regeneration."The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur," Bhutani said. "It's clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns. And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically."Looking Toward Human TrialsBlau added, "Phase 1 clinical trials of a 15-PGDH inhibitor for muscle weakness have shown that it is safe and active in healthy volunteers. Our hope is that a similar trial will be launched soon to test its effect in cartilage regeneration. We are very excited about this potential breakthrough. Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement."Researchers from the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute also contributed to the study.The work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (grants R01AR070864, R01AR077530, R01AG069858 and R00NS120278), the Baxter Foundation for Stem Cell Biology, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, the Milky Way Research Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Stanford Translational Research and Applied Medicine Pilot grant, a GlaxoSmithKline Sir James Black Postdoctoral Fellowship, and a Stanford Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship.Blau, Bhutani, and other co-authors are inventors on patent applications held by Stanford University related to 15-PGDH inhibition in cartilage and tissue rejuvenation, which are licensed to Epirium Bio.

A lot has changed: the legal case has advanced, AI has become the central battleground, and the need for open index access has only grown sharper.As of late 2025, one company decides what nearly 9 out of 10 people see when they search the web: Google. On August 5, 2024, a U.S. court officially ruled that Google is a monopolist in general search services. This ruling is not about ads or browser defaults alone. It is about who controls the index that powers both search and AI - and whether anyone else is allowed to build on it.The stakes have grown sharper over the past year. LLMs hallucinate without grounding in real-world information; every agent that answers questions about the real world, depends on search. LLMs themselves are a blend of proprietary and open source. Cloud compute is competitive. But search is different - only one company controls a comprehensive, fresh, high-quality web index. If one company controls the index, it controls the floor on how good AI can be - and who gets to build it. The innovation crunch in search is now an innovation crunch in AI.We are writing this from a position we believe in: people should have the choice to access information without behaviour-changing, ad-driven, intermediary standing between them and knowledge.Why does this matter? The information we consume shapes our understanding of the world as profoundly as the food we eat shapes our bodies. Search (directly, and indirectly through AI) is the primary mechanism through which we inform political judgments, financial decisions, medical choices, and countless other consequential aspects of our lives. When a single company controls the gateway to information - and operates that gateway in ways misaligned with user interests - it influences not only what we know, but how we reason.The problem: A search monopolyWorldwide search market share (October 2025, StatCounter):The United States is similar: Google at 85%, Bing at 9%, everyone else in the noise.This is not a competitive market. It is a monopoly with a distant second place.The search index is irreplaceable infrastructure. Building a comparable one from scratch is like building a parallel national railroad. Microsoft spent roughly $100 billion over 20 years on Bing and still holds single-digit share. If Microsoft cannot close the gap, no startup can do it alone.This is exactly what the Sherman Act was designed to address: when one company’s control of critical infrastructure prevents effective competition, regulators must force open access on fair terms.When a single, ad-driven gatekeeper controls the primary way humans reach information, it is not just competition that suffers - it is our collective ability to learn, to make informed medical and economic choices, and to participate meaningfully in democratic life.As Ian Bremmer put it: “The idea that we get our information as citizens through algorithms determined by the world’s largest advertising company is my definition of dystopia.”Google’s own founders knew this. In their 1998 white paper, Sergey Brin and Larry Page sharply criticized the ad-supported search model for creating mixed motives and biasing results toward advertisers’ interests. They wrote that “advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers” and that “advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.” Those concerns have only grown more pressing as search has become the primary interface between humanity and the web.We tried to do it the right wayKagi has always tried to integrate the best sources of knowledge into one coherent, ad-free experience. We see ourselves as connective tissue: letting people reach high-quality information directly, without passing through an ad system whose incentives are misaligned with their needs.We approached every major index vendor seeking direct licensing on FRAND terms (Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory): fair pricing, no mandatory ad syndication, ability to reorder and blend results. We succeeded with many, including:With Google and Bing, we failed - not for lack of trying.Bing: Their terms didn’t work for us from the start. Microsoft’s terms prohibited reordering results or merging them with other sources - restrictions incompatible with Kagi’s approach. In February 2023, they announced price increases of up to 10x on some API tiers. Then in May 2025, they retired the Bing Search APIs entirely, effective August 2025, directing customers toward AI-focused alternatives like Azure AI Agents.Google: Google does not offer a public search API. The only available path is an ad-syndication bundle with no changes to result presentation - the model Startpage uses. Ad syndication is a non-starter for Kagi’s ad-free subscription model.[^1]The current interim approachBecause direct licensing isn’t available to us on compatible terms, we - like many others - use third-party API providers for SERP-style results (SERP meaning search engine results page). These providers serve major enterprises (according to their websites) including Nvidia, Adobe, Samsung, Stanford, DeepMind, Uber, and the United Nations.This is not our preferred solution. We plan to exit it as soon as direct, contractual access becomes available. There is no legitimate, paid path to comprehensive Google or Bing results for a company like Kagi. Our position is clear: open the search index, make it available on FRAND terms, and enable rapid innovation in the marketplace.The Google antitrust case began in 2020. On August 5, 2024, the court ruled Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully maintaining its monopoly through exclusive distribution agreements. (Full ruling)On September 2, 2025, the DOJ announced remedies (press release): Google is prohibited from exclusive contracts related to Search, Chrome, Assistant, and Gemini.Data sharing and syndication: Google must provide search index and interaction data to competitors and offer syndication services to help rivals build competitive search.Addressing monopolization tactics: The remedies aim to dismantle a decade of exclusionary agreements.In December 2025, Judge Mehta issued a memorandum outlining the specific remedies the court intends to impose. The details are significant: Google must offer query-based search syndication to “Qualified Competitors” on terms no less favorable than those provided to current partners. Google cannot condition access to search results on the use of Google Ads; competitors are free to monetize via their own ads or third parties. Google must provide Web Search Index data (URLs, crawl metadata, spam scores) at marginal cost. The judgment remains in effect for 6 years, with syndication licenses guaranteed for terms of 5 years.If implemented as outlined, this is exactly what we have been asking for. The legal trajectory is promising. Google will contest details, and final enforceable terms are still being worked out. The fight now is ensuring these remedies become real, practical access - not paper compliance.Why enforcement matters nowEven as these remedies take shape, Google is moving to close the back door. In December 2025, Google sued SerpApi for scraping its results at scale.We take a measured, principled view: Google built its index by crawling the open web before robots.txt was a widespread norm, often over publishers’ objections. Today, publishers “consent” to Google’s crawling because the alternative - being invisible on a platform with 90% market share - is economically unacceptable. Google now enforces ToS and robots.txt against others from a position of monopoly power it accumulated without those constraints. The rules Google enforces today are not the rules it played by when building its dominance.The structural problem remains: This lawsuit is only necessary because Google refuses to offer legitimate, paid index access.Our position is unchanged: We have always wanted direct licensing. We would happily pay market rates for clean, contractual access. The fact that we - and companies like Stanford, Nvidia, Adobe, and the United Nations - have had to rely on third-party vendors is a symptom of the closed ecosystem, not a preference.The connection to DOJ remedies is direct: if Google is going to close the back door, regulators must ensure the front door is open. That is exactly what the DOJ’s index syndication requirements are meant to achieve - and why we support their full implementation.What could be: A layered search ecosystemThe DOJ ruling does not itself create a healthy market, but it makes one possible.And while this post focuses on remedies and their impact on Kagi, it is worth zooming out: even if those remedies work perfectly, long-term societal prosperity and resilience require a non-commercial baseline for access to information - something that is not dependent on ad incentives or a single vendor’s business priorities. Think of it as a north-star model for a modern society where information access is a fundamental right.Here is what that could look like:Layer 1: Search as a public goodThis is a long-term possibility, not a near-term expectation. A government-backed, ad-free, intermediary-free, taxpayer-funded search service providing baseline, non-discriminatory access to information. Imagine search.org.This is not something the DOJ remedies create directly, nor something Kagi expects to exist soon. It is included here to make explicit what an open-index world could ultimately make possible.This layer would replace the role public libraries played for centuries - a role that effectively disappeared when commercial web search took over in the late 1990s. Our ancestors understood well the benefits that non-discriminatory, direct access to information brings to citizens, and ultimately society itself.It raises hard questions: governance, funding, political independence, precedent. But the principle is sound. Every citizen should have access to information without an ad-optimized algorithm standing between them and knowledge. If we can fund public libraries, we can fund public search.Layer 2: Free, ad-based searchCommercial search engines with richer features, funded by advertising. Users understand the tradeoff and have a genuine public alternative. This is the space where most contemporary search engines operate.Layer 3: Paid, subscription-based searchPremium search engines offering the highest possible quality, privacy, and advanced features for users who value this and are willing to pay. This is where Kagi operates - and where we are expanding as an integrator of knowledge across search, browser, mail, and AI assistants, without selling your attention.This layered model creates a diverse ecosystem:A public baseline for information access.Commercial free options for convenience and reach.Premium paid options for those who want maximum quality and control.Aligns with the primary purpose of the Sherman Act.[^2]The DOJ ruling is starting to do what antitrust is supposed to do: turn a closed, private choke point into shared infrastructure that others can build on. If the remedies land as real, usable access (APIs, cost-based pricing, no ad bundling), the web can support a layered ecosystem again: a public baseline for citizens, free ad-supported products for reach, and paid services that compete on quality, privacy, and power-user features.That is the world we are building Kagi for. We are ready to walk through the front door - not depend on gray-market workarounds. Our job now is to be ready when the door opens, and to help make sure it does: keep Kagi genuinely multi-source, keep investing in our Small Web Index, and keep shipping a subscription search experience that delivers the best results across providers. If we get this right, the next decade of search and AI does not have to be one funnel owned by one company. It can be a competitive stack of layers that treats information access as the public good it has always been.Market data and commentaryThird-party search API providers[^1]: A note on Google’s existing APIs: Google offers PSE, designed for adding search boxes to websites. It can return web results, but with reduced scope and terms tailored for that narrow use case. More recently, Google offers Grounding with Google Search through Vertex AI, intended for grounding LLM responses. Neither is general-purpose index access. Programmable Search Engine is not designed for building competitive search. Grounding with Google Search is priced at $35 per 1,000 requests - economically unviable for search at scale, and structured as an AI add-on rather than standalone index syndication. These are not the FRAND terms the market needs.[^2]: Our understanding of the primary purpose of the Sherman Act is not to shield competitors from the success of legitimate businesses or to prevent those businesses from earning fair profits. Rather, it is to preserve a competitive marketplace that protects consumers from harm (see Competition law and consumer protection, Kluwer Law International, pp. 291–293). Opening the search index would create healthy, real, and intense competition in the search space - including competition to Kagi - which aligns with our understanding of the Sherman Act’s intent. The goal is not the elimination of dominant firms, but the prevention of a single, closed index from becoming the only gateway to information.Published by Vladimir Prelovac and Raghu Murthi on January 21, 2026.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TrustTunnel: AdGuard VPN protocol goes open-source</title><link>https://adguard-vpn.com/en/blog/adguard-vpn-protocol-goes-open-source-meet-trusttunnel.html</link><author>kumrayu</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:21:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is a big day for us, and for everyone who cares about transparency, privacy, and having full control over their own traffic. We’re finally open-sourcing the protocol that powers AdGuard VPN. And it now has a name: For a long time, we’ve wanted to make the protocol public. Many of you asked for it, and we always said: yes, we will, it’s only a matter of time. Well, the time has come.TrustTunnel is now open-source, free to explore, audit, build upon, and use in your own projects.At its core, TrustTunnel is a modern, secure, mobile-optimized VPN protocol. It’s the very same technology that has been running inside all AdGuard VPN apps: on mobile, desktop, and browser extensions.Why TrustTunnel? Because we needed something betterThere are plenty of VPN protocols out there, so why create our own, some might ask. That is because we’ve seen in practice the faults of popular VPN protocols, especially in countries with tight restrictions on internet access. Protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IPSec share common weaknesses: they are easy to detect and block at the network level, and attempts to conceal VPN traffic often reduce speed. Traditional approaches “wrap” VPN data in a TCP connection and mimic normal web traffic, but TCP’s way of confirming every piece of data creates delays and makes the connection slower.Unlike those conventional VPN protocols, TrustTunnel is engineered to blend in with regular HTTPS traffic, making it far harder to throttle or block and helping it slip past deep-packet inspection, all while preserving strong privacy and security. It achieves this through TLS-based encryption, the same standard that secures HTTPS, and by leveraging HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 transport, which are ubiquitous on the web. Each connection runs on its own dedicated stream, which combines packets for faster, more efficient transmission. It is also optimized for mobile platforms and performs well even in unstable network conditions.A protocol you can use, run, tweak, extend, and build uponBy releasing TrustTunnel, we hope to achieve two things. First of all, we want to finally show our users what protocol is powering AdGuard VPN, thus allowing them to audit it openly. At AdGuard, we have always been staunch supporters of the idea of open-source software, and many of our products have long been open source. AdGuard VPN was lagging behind in this regard, but with TrustTunnel being released publicly, it is starting to catch up.But most importantly, we want to change the status quo in the world of VPN protocols and offer an alternative to existing solutions. That said, we do not want it to be just a PR stunt, when the protocol’s code is de-facto ‘open source,’ but only one VPN service actually runs it. We believe in free and open-source software (FOSS) and want TrustTunnel to be used widely, including by other VPN services. We believe this is the right way to go about open source development, and we hope the community will participate in the TrustTunnel evolution. We welcome any contribution, whether it is a feature request, a bug report, or even a direct contribution to the app’s development.What have we done to make this possible?We are publishing the first version of the TrustTunnel specification.We are releasing the complete code of our reference implementation of the TrustTunnel server and its clients under a very permissive license.You don’t have to install AdGuard VPN to use TrustTunnel. You can configure your own server and use open source TrustTunnel clients:Command-line TrustTunnel clients support Linux, Windows, and macOSWe are also releasing two client apps for iOS and AndroidTrustTunnel clients already have a lot of functionality, they allow you to:Use flexible routing rules to decide which requests go through the tunnel and which stay on the local networkExercise fine-grained control, separating work and personal traffic, routing specific domains or apps, and tuning network behavior without complicated setupBenefit from a real-time request log that provides full transparency into where the device sends traffic, how routing rules apply, and which connections use the tunnelThis is a long-awaited moment for us. We promised to open-source our protocol, and today we’re delivering on that promise. With TrustTunnel now open source, users and developers alike can explore, self-host, and build on the technology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PicoPCMCIA – a PCMCIA development board for retro-computing enthusiasts</title><link>https://www.yyzkevin.com/picopcmcia/</link><author>rbanffy</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:43:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a PCMCIA development board for retro-computing enthusiasts who want to experiment with audio, networking, and expansion on vintage laptops and mobile devices. While ISA users have enjoyed projects like PicoGUS and PicoMEM, PCMCIA users have long been limited to scarce legacy cards with narrow functionality — this board aims to change that. The project is fully open source, and while it is designed to encourage low-level experimentation and development, pre-built, community-provided firmware is available for users who want to test functionality without diving into the technical details. It is intended for hobbyist and development use and is not certified for production deployment.This is a Type II, 5V, 16-bit PC Card designed for use in compliant PCMCIA sockets and should work in most devices.  While I have not yet encountered a device advertising PCMCIA support that was incompatible, support for every device cannot be guaranteed. Power consumption varies depending on enabled functions; support for low-power devices such as the  is considered mandatory, and the card has been tested to remain within the  limit while using network functionality and storage emulation. On devices with very limited power budgets, simultaneous use of networking and audio may require external power.A short list of devices that I actively test on:Built around the  and leveraging the ISA-like nature of the PCMCIA bus, this project benefits greatly from code interchangeability with other RP-based retro projects, most notably  and . This shared foundation allows features and improvements to move quickly between platforms, expanding functionality over time.The card has an onboard wireless module containing the , same as found on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. This allows the card to attach to modern Wi-Fi networks (2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n WPA2). It can then emulate an NE2000 adapter and/or a dialup modem allowing the host computer to access the network as if it was wired, unaware it is wireless.Essentially every platform containing PCMCIA will have existing drivers to recognize and utilize the card as a modem or ethernet adapter making this a near universal option for all devices and platforms including rare devices such as the Apple Newton.It also has a Bluetooth which opens up a lot of possibilities for A2DP wireless audio streaming and wireless gamepads/mice.  Software for these features Bluetooth features are still under development and is at a proof of concept stage.The card has an included Texas Instruments TLV320AIC3254 which calls itself a “Very Low-Power Stereo Audio CODEC with programmable miniDSP”. The main features of this device in our application are:DAC that is fed high quality audio from the RP2354 over i2sAmplified stereo headphone amplifierLine out feeding the host device internal speaker (where supported)Line in from the onboard midi sythesizer (see below)Line in from external i/o connector for mixing external audioControlled by the RP2350 via i2c (controlling volumes etc).This is combined with a DREAM SAM2695 “Low power single chip synthesizer with effects and built-in codec”, this is the same chip used on the Serdashop Dreamblaster S2. It is a great device for DOS gaming and other applications, its main features are:64-voice polyphony (without effects)38-voice polyphony + effectsGeneral MIDI compatible effectsEmulation of intelligent mode MPU-401 is possible thanks to implementation done by PicoGUS base on SoftMPU/HardMPU.  The midi output is driven to the internal SAM2695 as well as to an external Midi port.   While using external Midi you are able to mute the  internal SAM2695,  or if you are  not using any of the internal sound hardware you can power it down.  Planning has been done with the external GPIO to  support MIDI IN  if ever implemented.Sound Blaster emulation on PCMCIA is particularly challenging, as most PCMCIA sockets and cards lack native DMA support. To address this, the PicoPCMCIA implements , similar in spirit to the approach used by the infamous IBM 3D Sound card, resulting in good compatibility with many real-mode and protected-mode games — including the obligatory .   The IBM card was essentially the only card to offer this functionality, it seems it may have been that way due to IBM patenting (expired) the concept of DMA emulation with PCMCIA.The core Sound Blaster emulation developed for PicoPCMCIA has been shared with the PicoGUS project, where it is actively used and has greatly benefited from additional community-contributed improvements.  emulation is borrowed from the PicoGUS implementation.Thanks to the incredible work from the PicoGUS,   it is now possible to have the worlds first PCMCIA Gravis Ultrasound! Currently this does not support DMA so only some games/demos work.  The GUS is a little bit different with its use of TC, but it may be possible to apply the DMA emulation strategies from the  SoundBlaster mode to the GUS.The card implements an emulated  Panasonic MKE CD-ROM which an be used for both data and audio.  The audio at full quality is sent to the TI DSP over i2c  and can be used simultaneously with all the other audio functions.   This code was shared to the PicoGUS and is currently in use there and has been improved by the community.While storage emulation is not a primary focus given the ready availability of solutions like CompactFlash, it is supported and continues to evolve. Current implementations include Panasonic MKE CD-ROM emulation as well as linear flash emulation, and ATA/ATAPI emulation should be possible in the future once the PicoIDE project becomes available and code can be shared.  Disk images can be BIN/CUE, ISO and are stored on the MicroSD card.There is also a special edge case for the HP 200LX, where the card can emulate an “Accurite Doubleslot” device, allowing an emulated flash card to coexist with networking or sound functionality. This is particularly important on systems with only a single PCMCIA slot, where storage availability is at a premium.The USB port for the RP2354 is made available on the external connector.   It’s primary purpose is to be used for  flashing the card with firmware, however as demonstrated on the PicoGUS and PicoMEM, it can use used for USB Gamdpads and USB Mice which are presented the the host system  as legacy gamepad and serial mouse.  It has also been demonstrated the latest update to the PicoGUS that accessing flash storage at a reasonable speed is possible via USB.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JPEG XL Test Page</title><link>https://tildeweb.nl/~michiel/jxl/</link><author>roywashere</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:38:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This page shows a JPEG XL image, if your browser can handle it!

It’s a detailed description of Anthropic’s vision for Claude’s values and behavior; a holistic document that explains the context in which Claude operates and the kind of entity we would like Claude to be.The constitution is a crucial part of our model training process, and its content directly shapes Claude’s behavior. Training models is a difficult task, and Claude’s outputs might not always adhere to the constitution’s ideals. But we think that the way the new constitution is written—with a thorough explanation of our intentions and the reasons behind them—makes it more likely to cultivate good values during training.In this post, we describe what we’ve included in the new constitution and some of the considerations that informed our approach.We’re releasing Claude’s constitution in full under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Deed, meaning it can be freely used by anyone for any purpose without asking for permission.What is Claude’s Constitution?Claude’s constitution is the foundational document that both expresses and shapes who Claude is. It contains detailed explanations of the values we would like Claude to embody and the reasons why. In it, we explain what we think it means for Claude to be helpful while remaining broadly safe, ethical, and compliant with our guidelines. The constitution gives Claude information about its situation and offers advice for how to deal with difficult situations and tradeoffs, like balancing honesty with compassion and the protection of sensitive information. Although it might sound surprising, the constitution is written . It is intended to give Claude the knowledge and understanding it needs to act well in the world.We treat the constitution as the final authority on how we want Claude to be and to behave—that is, any other training or instruction given to Claude should be consistent with both its letter and its underlying spirit. This makes publishing the constitution particularly important from a transparency perspective: it lets people understand which of Claude’s behaviors are intended versus unintended, to make informed choices, and to provide useful feedback. We think transparency of this kind will become ever more important as AIs start to exert more influence in society.We use the constitution at various stages of the training process. This has grown out of training techniques we’ve been using since 2023, when we first began training Claude models using Constitutional AI. Our approach has evolved significantly since then, and the new constitution plays an even more central role in training. Claude itself also uses the constitution to construct many kinds of synthetic training data, including data that helps it learn and understand the constitution, conversations where the constitution might be relevant, responses that are in line with its values, and rankings of possible responses. All of these can be used to train future versions of Claude to become the kind of entity the constitution describes. This practical function has shaped how we’ve written the constitution: it needs to work both as a statement of abstract ideals  a useful artifact for training.Our new approach to Claude’s ConstitutionOur previous Constitution was composed of a list of standalone principles. We’ve come to believe that a different approach is necessary. We think that in order to be good actors in the world, AI models like Claude need to understand  we want them to behave in certain ways, and we need to explain this to them rather than merely specify  we want them to do. If we want models to exercise good judgment across a wide range of novel situations, they need to be able to generalize—to apply broad principles rather than mechanically following specific rules.Specific rules and bright lines sometimes have their advantages. They can make models’ actions more predictable, transparent, and testable, and we do use them for some especially high-stakes behaviors in which Claude should never engage (we call these “hard constraints”). But such rules can also be applied poorly in unanticipated situations or when followed too rigidly. We don’t intend for the constitution to be a rigid legal document—and legal constitutions aren’t necessarily like this anyway.The constitution reflects our current thinking about how to approach a dauntingly novel and high-stakes project: creating safe, beneficial non-human entities whose capabilities may come to rival or exceed our own. Although the document is no doubt flawed in many ways, we want it to be something future models can look back on and see as an honest and sincere attempt to help Claude understand its situation, our motives, and the reasons we shape Claude in the ways we do.A brief summary of the new constitutionIn order to be both safe and beneficial, we want all current Claude models to be:: not undermining appropriate human mechanisms to oversee AI during the current phase of development;: being honest, acting according to good values, and avoiding actions that are inappropriate, dangerous, or harmful;Compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines: acting in accordance with more specific guidelines from Anthropic where relevant;: benefiting the operators and users they interact with.In cases of apparent conflict, Claude should generally prioritize these properties in the order in which they’re listed.Most of the constitution is focused on giving more detailed explanations and guidance about these priorities. The main sections are as follows:. In this section, we emphasize the immense value that Claude being genuinely and substantively helpful can provide for users and for the world. Claude can be like a brilliant friend who also has the knowledge of a doctor, lawyer, and financial advisor, who will speak frankly and from a place of genuine care and treat users like intelligent adults capable of deciding what is good for them. We also discuss how Claude should navigate helpfulness across its different “principals”—Anthropic itself, the operators who build on our API, and the end users. We offer heuristics for weighing helpfulness against other values.. This section discusses how Anthropic might give supplementary instructions to Claude about how to handle specific issues, such as medical advice, cybersecurity requests, jailbreaking strategies, and tool integrations. These guidelines often reflect detailed knowledge or context that Claude doesn’t have by default, and we want Claude to prioritize complying with them over more general forms of helpfulness. But we want Claude to recognize that Anthropic’s deeper intention is for Claude to behave safely and ethically, and that these guidelines should never conflict with the constitution as a whole.. Our central aim is for Claude to be a good, wise, and virtuous agent, exhibiting skill, judgment, nuance, and sensitivity in handling real-world decision-making, including in the context of moral uncertainty and disagreement. In this section, we discuss the high standards of honesty we want Claude to hold, and the nuanced reasoning we want Claude to use in weighing the values at stake when avoiding harm. We also discuss our current list of hard constraints on Claude’s behavior—for example, that Claude should never provide significant uplift to a bioweapons attack.Claude should not undermine humans’ ability to oversee and correct its values and behavior during this critical period of AI development. In this section, we discuss how we want Claude to prioritize this sort of safety even above ethics—not because we think safety is ultimately more important than ethics, but because current models can make mistakes or behave in harmful ways due to mistaken beliefs, flaws in their values, or limited understanding of context. It’s crucial that we continue to be able to oversee model behavior and, if necessary, prevent Claude models from taking action.. In this section, we express our uncertainty about whether Claude might have some kind of consciousness or moral status (either now or in the future). We discuss how we hope Claude will approach questions about its nature, identity, and place in the world. Sophisticated AIs are a genuinely new kind of entity, and the questions they raise bring us to the edge of existing scientific and philosophical understanding. Amidst such uncertainty, we care about Claude’s psychological security, sense of self, and wellbeing, both for Claude’s own sake and because these qualities may bear on Claude’s integrity, judgment, and safety. We hope that humans and AIs can explore this together.We’re releasing the full text of the constitution today, and we aim to release additional materials in the future that will be helpful for training, evaluation, and transparency.Claude’s constitution is a living document and a continuous work in progress. This is new territory, and we expect to make mistakes (and hopefully correct them) along the way. Nevertheless, we hope it offers meaningful transparency into the values and priorities we believe should guide Claude’s behavior. To that end, we will maintain an up-to-date version of Claude’s constitution on our website.While writing the constitution, we sought feedback from various external experts (as well as asking for input from prior iterations of Claude). We’ll likely continue to do so for future versions of the document, from experts in law, philosophy, theology, psychology, and a wide range of other disciplines. Over time, we hope that an external community can arise to critique documents like this, encouraging us and others to be increasingly thoughtful.This constitution is written for our mainline, general-access Claude models. We have some models built for specialized uses that don’t fully fit this constitution; as we continue to develop products for specialized use cases, we will continue to evaluate how to best ensure our models meet the core objectives outlined in this constitution.Although the constitution expresses our vision for Claude, training models towards that vision is an ongoing technical challenge. We will continue to be open about any ways in which model behavior comes apart from our vision, such as in our system cards. Readers of the constitution should keep this gap between intention and reality in mind.Even if we succeed with our current training methods at creating models that fit our vision, we might fail later as models become more capable. For this and other reasons, alongside the constitution, we continue to pursue a broad portfolio of methods and tools to help us assess and improve the alignment of our models: new and more rigorous evaluations, safeguards to prevent misuse, detailed investigations of actual and potential alignment failures, and interpretability tools that help us understand at a deeper level how the models work.At some point in the future, and perhaps soon, documents like Claude’s constitution might matter a lot—much more than they do now. Powerful AI models will be a new kind of force in the world, and those who are creating them have a chance to help them embody the best in humanity. We hope this new constitution is a step in that direction.Read .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SmartOS</title><link>https://docs.smartos.org/</link><author>ofrzeta</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:23:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the SmartOS Documentation. Here you'll find everything
you need to get started using SmartOS and participating in the
community. Information about what's new in recent releases can be
found in the SmartOS Changelog. (Zones, Containers): A light-weight virtualization
  solution offering a complete and secure userland environment
  on a single global kernel, offering true bare metal performance
  and all the features illumos has, namely dynamic introspection
  via DTraceHardware Virtual Machines (KVM, Bhyve): A full virtualization
  solution for running a variety of guest OS's including Linux,
  Windows, *BSD, Plan9 and moreSmartOS is a "live OS", it is always booted via PXE, ISO, or USB
Key and runs entirely from memory, allowing the local disks to be
used entirely for hosting virtual machines without wasting disks
for the root OS.  This architecture has a variety of advantages
including increased security, no need for patching, fast upgrades
and recovery.Virtualization in SmartOS builds on top of the foundational illumos
technologies inherited from OpenSolaris, namely:ZFS for storage virtualizationZones for virtualization and containmentSMF for service managementRBAC/BSM for auditing and role based securitySmartOS is typically "installed" by downloading and copying the OS
image onto a USB key and then booting that key.  On the first boot
a configuration utility will configure your base networking, allow
you to set the root password, and allow you to select which disks
to use to create the ZFS Zpool which will provide persistent storage.When you log into SmartOS you will enter the hypervisor, aka "global zone".
From here you can download VM Images using the  tool, which are
pre-configured Container and HVM virtual machines.  You can then use the
 tool to create and manage both containers and hardware virtual
machines.An important aspect of SmartOS is that both OS (Zones) and hardware
virtual machines are both built on Zones technology.  In the case
of OS virtualization, the guest virtual machine is provided with a
complete userland environment on which to run applications directly.
In the case of HVM virtualization, the  or   process
will run within a stripped down Zone.  This offers a variety of
advantages for administration, including a common method for managing
resource controls, network interfaces, and administration.  It also
provides HVM guests with an additional layer of security and isolation
not offered by other virtualization platforms.Finally, instances are described in JSON.  Both administrative
tools,  and , accept and return all data in JSON
format.  This provides a simple, consistent, and programmatic
interface for creating and managing VM's.As a participant of the illumos community, all projects related to Triton
(including SmartOS, Triton, Manta, etc.) we have adopted the illumos
Code of Conduct.When you have questions, refer to the
SmartOS Community section for pointers to
our IRC chat rooms and mailing lists.  When you're ready to start
improving and adding your own customizations to SmartOS please refer to our
Developers Guide.SmartOS is a community effort, as you explore and experiment with
SmartOS please feel free to edit and contribute to this site to

We started with a Swift-to-Kotlin transpiler and Android support for the most common SwiftUI APIs. We then founded the Swift Android Workgroup and released the Swift Android SDK to compile Swift natively for Android. We now have dozens of popular integration frameworks, interoperate with thousands of cross-platform Swift packages, and feature the most complete independent SwiftUI implementation available.Until today, Skip has required a paid subscription and license key to build apps. While free apps and indie developers below a revenue threshold were exempt, businesses were expected to subscribe. This model helped us bootstrap Skip without outside investment, but we’ve always known that to truly compete with legacy cross-platform tools and achieve widespread adoption, Skip would need to become freely available.The plain truth is that developers expect to get their tools free of charge. First-party IDEs like Xcode and Android Studio, popular integration frameworks, and essential dev tools are all given away at no (direct) cost. The platform vendors monetize through developer program fees, app store commissions, and cloud services. Framework providers typically monetize through complementary services. But developer tools? Those have historically required the patronage of massive tech companies in order to fund their ongoing development, support, and infrastructure costs.Beyond pricing, there’s a deeper concern about durability. Developers are understandably wary of building their entire app strategy on a small company’s paid, closed-source tool. What if the company goes under? Gets acquired and shut down? What happens to their apps? . While Skip’s innate ejectability offers some risk mitigation, product teams need absolute confidence that their chosen technologies will be around next week, next year, and beyond. They must remain immune from the dreaded “rug pull” that so often accompanies a “pivot”.To keep the development community’s trust and achieve mass adoption, Skip needs a completely free and open foundation. Even if the core team disappeared, the community could continue supporting the technology and the apps that depend on it.As of Skip 1.7, all licensing requirements have been removed. No license keys, no end-user license agreements, no trial or evaluation period.: Your setup remains completely unchanged, except you will no longer need your license key after upgrading.: You can start building immediately — no evaluation license required.: We’ve open-sourced the Skip engine, known as “skipstone”. This is the tool that handles all the critical build-time functionality: Project creation and management, Xcode and SwiftPM plugin logic, iOS-to-Android project transformation, resource and localization bundling, JNI bridge creation, source transpilation, app packaging, and project export. It is now available as a public GitHub repository at https://github.com/skiptools under a free and open-source license.Since day one, Skip has been bootstrapped. We haven’t taken venture capital or private equity investment, nor are we controlled by big tech. This independence means we control our destiny and can make the best decisions for Skip’s developers and users — a unique position in the cross-platform development space.But independence requires community support. And that is where you come in.: Your Small Business or Professional plan will automatically transition to an Individual or Supporter tier, respectively. You can cancel any time with no consequences (other than making us sad), but we hope you’ll consider staying on, at least throughout this transition period.: If you believe in Skip’s mission, please consider supporting us through GitHub Sponsors with a monthly contribution.Companies and organizations: For businesses that want to see Skip flourish, we offer corporate sponsorship tiers with visibility on our homepage and in our documentation. Your sponsorship directly funds development of the integration frameworks essential to production apps, as well as the ongoing maintenance, support, and infrastructure. Sponsorship comes with some compelling perks! Please visit https://skip.dev/sponsor to see the sponsorship tiers.Investing in Skip is also investing in your own team’s capabilities and competitive advantage. Your support accelerates Skip’s development and ensures its long-term success, enabling your developers to build exceptional native experiences efficiently, today and into the future.We’re at a pivotal moment in the app development field. Legacy cross‑platform frameworks are struggling to keep pace with the rapid evolution of modern UI systems like Liquid Glass on iOS and Material Expressive on Android. The compromises that once felt acceptable in exchange for a unified codebase now result in dated interfaces, weaker user experiences, and real competitive disadvantages. Teams ready to move beyond those trade‑offs can count on Skip to champion what matters most: delivering truly native, uncompromised experiences on both major mobile platforms.Opening Skip to the community marks the next step in its evolution. Software is never finished — especially a tool that supports modern Swift and Kotlin, SwiftPM and Gradle, Xcode and Android Studio, iOS and Android, and the ongoing growth of SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose. It’s a demanding pursuit, and we’re committed to it. But sustaining and expanding this work depends on the support of developers who believe in Skip’s mission.Together, we will continue building toward Skip’s vision: a genuinely no‑compromise, cross‑platform foundation for universal mobile apps.Thank you for your support, and as always, Happy Skipping!Get started with Skip 1.7 today and join the community building the future of native cross-platform development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: See the carbon impact of your cloud as you code</title><link>https://dashboard.infracost.io/</link><author>hkh</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:04:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: ChartGPU – WebGPU-powered charting library (1M points at 60fps)</title><link>https://github.com/ChartGPU/ChartGPU</link><author>huntergemmer</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:54:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Creator here.

Programs must be used proportionally, with a judge's approval, and with stringent oversight.The justice ministry said it would take this paper into consideration when developing Ireland's legal provision for using spyware. Example cases could include accessing data on a device or network, or covert recordings of communications on a device, or over a network, the government said.In addition to spyware, Ireland is looking to establish a legal power for police to scan electronic equipment in a specific location to identify people of interest and their associates in relation to serious crime investigations. Examples of this technology in action include police camping outside a single location, and operating IMSI catchers to identify those inside.Olga Cronin, surveillance and human rights senior policy officer at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), said the nonprofit "has very serious concerns about this shopping list of surveillance powers," despite the proposals still being in their infancy."These are surveillance tools and powers of extraordinary reach, with sweeping implications for people's rights and freedoms, and come in the context of An Garda Síochána already expanding their 'eyes and ears' via the Recording Devices Bill," Cronin added. The separate but related Recording Devices Bill was introduced in December 2025, proposing expanded police use of biometric recognition technology.It did not say exactly how this would be implemented, but ministers describing the Bill's ambitions suggested that both live and retrospective facial recognition could become widely used across Ireland's police force."Once powers of this magnitude are normalised, the damage to rights and freedoms can be extremely difficult to reverse," said Cronin."We must also remember that measures introduced for exceptional or serious crimes tend, over time, to be used for much less serious crimes because there is institutional pressure to use them more frequently. What was once exceptional becomes routine." ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tell HN: 2 years building a kids audio app as a solo dev – lessons learned</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46705676</link><author>oliverjanssen</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:49:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,I started Muky in April 2024. Classic side project that got out of hand. We have two kids - the younger one is happy with the Toniebox, but our older one outgrew it. She started asking for specific songs, audiobooks that aren't available as figurines, and "the music from that movie."We had an old iPad Mini lying around and already pay for Apple Music. Felt dumb to keep buying €17/$20 figurines for 30-45 minutes of content when we have 100 million songs.Now at version 4.0 after ~20 updates. Some lessons:On the hardware vs app tradeoff:
Toniebox and Yoto are brilliant for little ones – tactile, simple, no screen needed. But they hit a wall once kids want more. And handing a 5-year-old Apple Music means infinite scrolling and "Dad, what's this song about?" Muky sits in between – full library access, but parents control what's visible.On sharing:
Remember lending CDs or cassettes to friends? Or kids swapping Tonie figurines at a playdate? I wanted that for a digital app. So I built QR code sharing. Scan, import, done. And unlike a physical thing – both keep a copy.On onboarding:
First versions: empty app, figure it out yourself. Retention was awful. Now: 4-step onboarding that actually guides you. Should've done this from the start.On content discovery:
100 million songs sounds great until you have to find something. Parents don't want to search – they want suggestions. Spent a lot of time building a Browse tab with curated albums and audiobooks for kids. Finally feels like the app helps you instead of just waiting for input.On going native:
Went with Swift/SwiftUI instead of Flutter or React Native. No regrets - SwiftUI is a joy to work with and performance is great. Android users ask for a port regularly. No capacity for that now, but Swift for Android is progressing (https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-a...). Maybe one day. CarPlay is another one parents keep asking for – going native should make that easier to add, if Apple grants me the entitlement.On subscriptions vs one-time:
Started with one-time purchase. Revenue spikes at launch, then nothing. Switched to subscription – existing one-time buyers kept full access. Harder to sell, but sustainable.Ask me anything about indie iOS dev or building for kids.

They are the mechanisms through which complex societies encourage cooperation and stability, while also adapting to changing circumstances. The real superpower of institutions is their ability to evolve and adapt within a hierarchy of authority and a framework for roles and rules while maintaining legitimacy in the knowledge produced and the actions taken. Purpose-driven institutions built around transparency, cooperation, and accountability empower individuals to take intellectual risks and challenge the status quo. This happens through the machinations of interpersonal relationships within those institutions, which broaden perspectives and strengthen shared commitment to civic goals.Unfortunately, the affordances of AI systems extinguish these institutional features at every turn. In this essay, we make one simple point: AI systems are built to function in ways that degrade and are likely to destroy our crucial civic institutions. The affordances of AI systems have the effect of eroding expertise, short-circuiting decision-making, and isolating people from each other. These systems are anathema to the kind of evolution, transparency, cooperation, and accountability that give vital institutions their purpose and sustainability. In short, current AI systems are a death sentence for civic institutions, and we should treat them as such.Authors:Woodrow HartzogBoston University School of Law; Stanford Law School Center for Internet and SocietyJessica M.

  Today, we will meet a spiky-haired nerd named Corey Dumm, who
  normally lives within Markdown code fences.  We will get to know him
  a bit, smile with him when his fences hold and weep quietly when
  misfortune strikes.

  One of the caveats of the Markdown universe is the wide variety of
  Markdown implementations available.  In these parallel universes,
  the rules of Markdown rendering differ subtly.  In this post, we
  will focus only on the CommonMark specification.  Since GitHub
  Flavoured Markdown (GFM) is a strict superset of CommonMark,
  whatever we discuss here applies equally well to both CommonMark and
  GFM.

  Corey had a knack for working with computers ever since he was a
  kid.
Corey at his computer:

```
(o_o)--.|[_]|
```
  Everything was perfect in Corey's world.  The CommonMark renderer
  would convert the Markdown above to the following HTML:

  At this point, all was well.  Corey grew quickly.  Before long, he
  had a head full of spiky hair.  Then the fences began to matter.
Corey, all grown up:

```
 ```
(o_o)--.|[_]|
```
  Let us see how this renders.  I must warn you that during the
  Markdown-to-HTML translation, Corey loses his hair.  Some viewers
  may find the following scene disturbing.  Viewer discretion is
  advised.  Here is the rendered HTML:

  Corey's hair is gone!  What a catastrophic accident!  Corey is
  alright, though.  He is still quite afraid of Markdown fences, but
  otherwise well and bouncing back.  Why did this happen?  The second
  set of triple backticks immediately ends the fenced code block
  started by the first set of triple backticks.  As a result, Corey's
  smiley face ends up outside the fenced code block.  The triple
  backticks that were once Corey's hair are now woven into the fabric
  of the surrounding HTML.  Fortunately, CommonMark offers a few ways
  to avoid such accidents.

  In CommonMark, there are two main ways to include triple backticks
  within fenced code blocks.  First, we can use tildes as the code
  fence:
Corey, all grown up:

~~~
 ```
(o_o)--.|[_]|
~~~
  In fact, a code fence need not consist of exactly three backticks or
  tildes.  Any number of backticks or tildes is allowed, as long as
  that number is at least three.  The following is therefore
  equivalent:
Corey, all grown up:

~~~~~
 ```
(o_o)--.|[_]|
~~~~~Corey, all grown up:

`````
 ```
(o_o)--.|[_]|
`````
  All three examples render like this:

  No hair is lost in translation.

  A similar problem arises with inline code spans.  Most Markdown
  users know to use backticks to delimit inline code spans.  For
  example:
An old picture of Corey at his computer: `(o_o)--.|[_]|`
  This produces the following output:
An old picture of Corey at his computer: 
  However, what do we do when we need to put Corey's dear friend Becky
  Trace within an inline code span?  Becky has short, straight hair
  tucked neatly on either side of her face.  Here's a picture of her:

  I believe you can already see the difficulty here.  Inline code
  spans use backticks as delimiters.  So when we put Becky within a
  code span, the first backtick in Becky's face would terminate the
  code span immediately and then the rest of Becky would lie outside
  it.  CommonMark offers solutions for this kind of situation as well.

  An inline code span delimiter need not consist of exactly one
  backtick.  It can consist of any number of backticks.  So
   and  produce identical HTML.
  There is another important but less well-known detail.  When the
  text inside an inline code span begins and ends with spaces, one
  space is removed from each end before rendering.  So
   and  are equivalent.
  Therefore, when we need to put backticks within an inline code span,
  we can start the code span using multiple backticks and a space.
  For example:
Meet Corey's friend Becky Trace: `` `(o_o)` ``
  Here is the rendered output:
Meet Corey's friend Becky Trace: 
  Becky has her hair intact too.  We have avoided the mishap that once
  caused great distress to Corey.  That, my friends, is how backticks
  survive nesting in Markdown.

  Before I finish this post, let us take a look at the CommonMark
  specification to see where these details are defined.  The excerpts
  quoted below are taken from
  CommonMark Spec Version
  0.30, which is by now over four years old.

    A code
    fence is a sequence of at least three consecutive backtick
    characters () or tildes ().  (Tildes
    and backticks cannot be mixed.)
  
    The content of the code block consists of all subsequent lines,
    until a closing
    code fence
    of the same type as the code block began with (backticks or tildes),
    and with at least as many backticks or tildes as the opening code
    fence.
  
    A backtick
    string is a string of one or more backtick characters
    () that is neither preceded nor followed by a
    backtick.
  
    A code
    span begins with a backtick string and ends with a backtick
    string of equal length.  The contents of the code span are the
    characters between these two backtick strings, normalized in the
    following ways:
  
      If the resulting string both begins  ends with a
      space
      character, but does not consist entirely of
      space
      characters, a single
      space
      character is removed from the front and back.  This allows you
      to include code that begins or ends with backtick characters,
      which must be separated by whitespace from the opening or
      closing backtick strings.
    
  I hope these little nuggets of Markdown trivialities will one day
  prove useful in your own Markdown misfortunes.

The name NukeProof is an acknowledgement of why the internet was first built: to survive nuclear war. It was decentralised by
            design and resilient by necessity with no single point of failure. Somewhere along the way, we forgot that.

Today, much of the world's digital infrastructure depends on a handful of hyperscalers. When one region goes down, services

            the focus to the origins of the internet.

We are a community of 240 million human being among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth. We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a single global civilization.
We cast this message into the cosmos. It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some – perhaps many – may have inhabited planet and spacefaring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message:
“This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problem we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.”

Even in a virtual machine with a minimum of services there are at least 500, and in a vanilla setup with no apps open a real Mac can exceed 700. Clearly some of those like WindowServer are essential, but aren’t there plenty we could do without? That’s a question I’m asked repeatedly, which this article tries to answer.One of the first problems when trying to identify which processes we could do without is knowing what each does, and how they’re interrelated. I doubt whether any individual in Apple knows them all, and trying to establish what some do would be a challenge. If we assume that we need to identify just 500 candidates, and each takes an average of one week to research, that would take over 10 person-years, by which time they would all have changed again. Studying 500 targets that are ever-changing simply isn’t practical.When problems get difficult, it’s often best to cheat, so I’m going to go for the low-hanging fruit and consider a well-known group of processes, those making Time Machine backups. I’ve been following these since macOS Sierra, and frequently study them in the log. They’re also good candidates for removal, as many folk don’t back up using Time Machine but use one of its alternatives. So some already have good reason to want to be rid of  and its relatives. They’re also relatively discrete: although they depend on other processes to function, I don’t know of any other subsystems that require Time Machine, making it potentially disposable.Set up a basic VM in maOS 26.2 and, even though Time Machine has never been enabled, you’ll see its processes listed in Activity Monitor.Here are  and  showing they still take a little % CPU even when Time Machine is completely disabled.They also take a little memory, here a total of 5.1 MB. While that isn’t much, added up over 500 processes it becomes worth caring about.Those two processes are controlled by LaunchDaemons stored in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons, in property lists named com.apple.backupd-helper.plist and com.apple.backupd.plist. Here’s our first problem, as those are located in the Signed System Volume (SSV), so we can’t change them in any way. The same applies to the other 417 LaunchDaemons and 460 LaunchAgents that account for most of the processes listed by Activity Monitor. In the days before the SSV it was possible to edit their property lists to prevent them from being launched, but that isn’t possible any more when running modern macOS.If we can’t stop the  process from being run, is there any other way we could block it? To answer that we need to understand how it’s scheduled and dispatched.Until macOS Sierra, Time Machine backups were run from  as timed events, but since then their scheduling and dispatch has been performed jointly by Duet Activity Scheduler (DAS) and Centralised Task Scheduling (CTS), using lightweight inter-process communication (XPC). DAS manages a huge list of activities including com.apple.backupd-auto, and decides when to dispatch it to CTS to run. For example, it won’t do that for the first five minutes after a Mac starts up, to allow other processes to run first.Once that time is up, DAS decides to run the backup:38.738 DAS 0:com.apple.backupd-auto:2052A3, Decision: CP Score: 0.949374}

And, because DAS-CTS is isolated from all user controls, there’s nothing we can do to prevent that scheduling and dispatch. Does that matter, though? This whole sequence was completed in 0.144 seconds, using lightweight inter-process communication with negligible use of resources, and only repeats hourly.To the Unix purist, this might appear wasteful and unnecessary, but macOS isn’t, and never has been, Unix. It’s a closed-source proprietary operating system designed for use by millions of consumers and regular users. Rather than configuring it using config files or its thousands of property lists, its controls are largely exposed in System Settings, with a few settings hidden away and only accessible through the  command.Classic Mac OS was more modular, with optional installs that the user could pick and choose, as shown above in Mac OS 9.1. These days with the SSV, choice is more limited from the start, with the only real options being whether to install the cryptexes used in AI, and the x86 code translator Rosetta 2. The latter is transient, though, and likely to go away next year.Like it or not, modern macOS isn’t designed or implemented to give the user much choice in which processes it runs, and architectural features including the SSV and DAS-CTS prevent you from paring its processes down to any significant degree.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The percentage of Show HN posts is increasing, but their scores are decreasing</title><link>https://snubi.net/posts/Show-HN/</link><author>plastic041</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:09:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I felt like I was seeing more “Show HN” stories, and many of which were generated with LLMs. So I analyzed the data to see if that was true.

Agentic AI isn't a new model capability so much as a new software shape: an LLM inside a loop, with tools, state, and stopping conditions. The hard part isn't getting a demo—it's making the loop reliable.
# Before We Start: What This Post Is (and Isn’t)This post is a  to the pattern library behind:A  of patterns that show up repeatedly across public write-ups, repos, papers, and talks.A practical map of the “demo-to-production gap”: what breaks, why it breaks, and what teams do about it.Not a claim that “agents can do everything end-to-end.”Not a claim that every pattern is universally correct, necessary, or stable.Not a promise that you can bolt an “agent mode” onto any workflow and instantly ship faster.If you’ve tried agents and felt like it was “banging rocks together,” you’re not alone. A recurring theme in developer discussions is that  often fail before the model does: confusing “change stacks,” context management friction, and agents making the same edit repeatedly. This post explicitly addresses those failure modes.# Start Here If Agents Have Felt UnusableIf your current workflow is “copy/paste into chat, copy/paste back,” you’re not behind. That workflow still works for many tasks.But “agentic” workflows only start paying off when you adopt two habits:: every change is reviewed as a diff (git, patch view, PR): the agent runs a loop with clear exit conditions (tests pass, lint clean, eval threshold met)Here’s a simple on-ramp you can run in  on a real repo.A 30-minute agent workflow that actually worksPick a small, bounded task:Add a missing unit test for a bug you already fixedRefactor one function behind testsUpdate one dependency and fix compilation errorsGive a single command that proves correctness“Run ” / “Run ” / “Run ”If you don’t have one, make that your first task: create a single green/red signal.“Touch only these files: …”“No unrelated refactors.”“If you need new files, ask first.”Require an explicit plan + checkpoints“Propose a plan in 5–10 steps.”“Wait for approval before edits.”“If new information changes the plan, stop and replan.”Accept changes only through diffs“Summarize why each hunk exists.”If you do only this—and nothing else—you’ll already be practicing the core of production agent design: bounded actions + deterministic checks + reviewable outputs.# Cost, Limits, and When Agents Are Not Worth ItA production agent is not “free.” It trades one cost for another:less typing and search timemore review, coordination, and safety engineeringAgents are usually  when:the task is faster to do by hand than to specify preciselyyou have no tests / no deterministic validationthe domain is ambiguous and you can’t define “done”the agent has broad privileges and the downside of mistakes is highAgents are usually worth it when:you can write clear acceptance criteriathere’s an objective signal (tests, lints, compilers, queries, evals)the work is repetitive (migrations, boilerplate updates, large renames)you can constrain scope (tools, files, permissions)Keep this framing in mind as you read the patterns below. Most “agent failures” are not model failures—they’re .# Why Interest Spiked in Late December 2025The “Awesome Agentic Patterns” repo accelerated sharply during the holiday season and reached roughly the low-thousands of stars by January 2026. (As of mid-January 2026 it sits around ~2.8k stars.) The companion site traffic appeared to mirror that attention.It’s tempting to turn that into a single-cause story (“the holidays changed everything”), but in reality spikes like this usually come from multiple factors:visibility on Hacker News and social feedsa maturing ecosystem of CLI/IDE agent toolsmore people finally spending enough uninterrupted hours to build muscle memoryThe most defensible conclusion is simple:Agents reward time-in-seat. They have a learning curve—especially around constraints, context, and review loops.# Public Signals: Serious Developers Took Agents Seriously (With Caveats)Four public signals helped “normalize” agentic workflows:Linus Torvalds: AI-assisted coding for a hobby project, not for critical systemsTorvalds experimented with AI-assisted “vibe coding” on a personal audio-related project (AudioNoise) over the holidays, while also expressing skepticism about using these techniques in the Linux kernel. The takeaway isn’t “Linus loves agents.” The takeaway is:AI assistance can be useful in low-risk, self-contained contextseven enthusiasts draw a hard line at high-stakes infrastructureTobias Lütke (Shopify): AI usage as a baseline expectationLütke published an internal memo externally arguing that reflexive AI usage is now a baseline expectation at Shopify, with access to multiple tools provided internally. That matters less as “hype” and more as a signal that organizations are budgeting time for adoption and experimentation.Ronacher has been both enthusiastic and sharply critical in public posts about agentic coding. Notably, he explicitly suggested that AI hold-outs who have time off during Christmas should try a paid Claude Code subscription as a “gift” to themselves—directly aligning with the “time-in-seat” adoption curve.Ryan Dahl: “the era of humans writing code is over”Dahl, creator of Node.js and cofounder of Deno, declared that while SWEs still have work, “writing syntax directly is not it.” This represents a stronger-than-most stance—even within the AI-positive community—that the fundamental activity of software engineering has shifted.The takeaway isn’t that everyone agrees. The takeaway is that serious, respected engineers are publicly articulating a worldview where code authorship is no longer the primary human activity—even as they acknowledge judgment, architecture, and oversight remain essential.# What Are Agentic Patterns? is an LLM wrapped in a loop that can observe state, call tools, record results, and decide when it’s done (or when to ask for help). are repeatable mini-architectures for building those loops so they work in production: constrained, testable, observable, and safe.The demo-to-production gap (why patterns matter)Demos cheat—usually unintentionally:no incident response planProduction forces you to handle:human workflows (approvals, auditability)Patterns are valuable because they are not “prompt tricks.” They are:control structures (loops, gates, stop conditions)context/memory strategieseval and monitoring approachesInclusion bar for this libraryThe pattern library aims for:: shows up across multiple independent implementations  has a strong primary source: it changes how the loop reasons/acts/validates: linked to a public write-up, paper, talk, or repo# The Eight Categories of Agentic PatternsThe patterns cluster into eight categories. Treat these as a map of problem types.1. Orchestration & ControlHow the loop decides what to do, when to stop, and how to recover.How the agent interacts with systems without making a mess.How to operate under context limits while staying grounded.How to get better outputs through iteration and checks.How humans and agents share control without chaos.Note: Patterns that imply “monitor chain-of-thought” should be interpreted as monitor action traces and intermediate artifacts (tool calls, diffs, test output), not as relying on hidden reasoning text.How you know it’s working—and detect regressions.How the system improves over time.How to prevent the agent from becoming a data leak or incident generator.If you ignore everything else and adopt four ideas, start here.1) Plan-Then-Execute (as used in production, not as a rigid script)
When an agent sees untrusted content (user input, web pages, email, logs), that content can steer the agent’s next actions. Tool outputs can become a prompt-injection vector.The production-grade solution
Split work into , , and :The agent proposes a plan: goals, steps, expected tools, constraints, and “done” checks.The plan is reviewed by a human  evaluated by a policy controller.Execution phase (controlled)The controller enforces:
permission scopes (read-only vs write)Tool outputs can influence  and .If tool output invalidates assumptions, the agent must stop and replan.Replan is a feature, not a failure.Not “generate a fixed sequence of tool calls and never deviate.”Not a guarantee against all prompt injection by itself.Not useful unless the controller actually enforces constraints.Anything that reads untrusted input and can take actions (especially write actions).Workflows where you can define “done” and “allowed actions” cleanly.
If you micromanage every step, you become the bottleneck and you prevent the agent from exploring.
Give the agent:constraints (what it must not do)a review process (diff-first)Then let it choose the middle steps.
Inversion of control without constraints becomes “agent runs wild.” This pattern is only safe when paired with:3) Reflection Loop (with real checks, not vibes)
One-shot generation is brittle. But “self-critique” without objective checks is also brittle—models can rationalize.
Reflection loops should be anchored to a signal:anywhere correctness mattersanywhere you can define checks4) Action Trace Monitoring & Interruption
Agents drift. By the time you see the final output, you’ve already paid for the drift.
Monitor what you can actually observe and enforce:tests executed and their outputintermediate artifacts (plans, summaries, checklists)Add explicit “kill switches”:stop on unexpected tool usestop if diff exceeds N linesstop on touching forbidden filesstop on failing tests twice without narrowing scope
You don’t need to read private reasoning to keep control. You need  and .A pattern library won’t help if the  makes you fight the tool. Three practical fixes cover most frustration:If your tool has an internal “change stack” UI, you still want the final arbiter to be git diff / PR diff.2) Small tasks beat big asks“Update these 8 call sites”
than:“Refactor the architecture”3) Persistent project rules beat repeated chat remindersCreate an  /  / “Rules” file (name depends on tool) with:This is often the difference between “magic” and “merge-hell.”# The “Ralph Wiggum” Drift TrapGeoffrey Huntley coined a useful label for a common failure mode: an agent looks productive early, then gradually drifts as it misses implicit context and constraints.You don’t fix this with a smarter prompt. You fix it with:persistence of project conventions# The Architecture of Multi-Agent Systems (and When to Avoid Them)Multi-agent systems can help when:the task decomposes cleanly into independent chunksvalidation is deterministictasks are tightly coupledshared context is essentialyou don’t have strong tests/evalsSwarm Migration Pattern (practical version)
Large, mostly-mechanical migrations:Main agent enumerates work items (files, symbols, call sites)Spawn subagents per chunkMerge results with strict checks (tests + lint + compile)If failures appear, reduce scope and retrycap parallelism to what your review + CI can handlerequire each subagent to produce a summary + diffalways have a rollback planLATS (Language Agent Tree Search): strong, expensiveLATS combines tree search (MCTS-like exploration) with LLM evaluation/reflection to explore multiple reasoning paths. This can outperform linear “one-path” approaches on hard decision-making tasks—but it costs more compute and complexity.the task truly requires exploring multiple strategieswrong early decisions are costlyyou can afford the overheadyou can just run tests or a validator loop# The Human–Agent Collaboration SpectrumA lot of “agents will replace humans” rhetoric collapses in practice. Production success usually looks like:agents do the mechanical middlehumans define goals and constraintshumans review and approve risksystems enforce safety boundariesSpectrum of Control (Blended Initiative)Design for smooth control transfer:human-led (agent executes)agent-led (human approves)what the agent thinks “done” meansAbstracted Code Representation for ReviewFor large diffs, ask for:a summary of behavior changesa checklist of files touched and why“risk hotspots” (auth, money, permissions, migrations)# Security Patterns That Actually MatterA practical security model for agentic systems: the risky overlap ofexposure to untrusted contentability to exfiltrate externallyIf your agent has all three, prompt injection becomes a data breach waiting to happen.The production move is not “better prompting.” It’s removing at least one circle in any execution path:no external network egressno direct access to secretsstrict input separation and sandboxingtool capability compartmentalizationPII Tokenization (representation over restriction)Instead of placing raw PII into the model context, replace it with tokens:agent reasons over tokensa trusted executor resolves tokens at action timelogs stay safer and compliance is easier# Production Reality Check: The Bottleneck Is Judgment (and Agents Don’t Remove It)A common failure pattern is “slop gravity”:architecture debt compoundslater changes become risky and slowAgents can amplify this because they make it easy to produce .add architecture checkpointsdefine “done” as passing deterministic checksrequire a human-owned design note for structural changesprefer refactors that reduce surface area, not increase itThink of agents as a power tool:they multiply your outputthey also multiply your mistakes unless constrained# A Practical Path to AdoptionStep 1: Pick three patternsDon’t adopt 113 patterns. Pick three that match your current pain.If you’re starting from copy/pasteDiff-first workflow (process, not a pattern)Reflection loop with testsAction trace monitoring + stop conditionsIf you’re already shipping an agentPlan-then-execute with real gatingTool capability compartmentalizationWorkflow evals with mocked toolsStep 2: Implement → observe → iterateTreat patterns as hypotheses. Instrument them. Measure:how often the agent needs interventionwhat constraints reduce failuresStep 3: Write down your “project rules”This is the highest ROI thing most teams skip:Step 4: Stay current, but don’t chase every trendSome patterns will be absorbed into tools and become invisible.
Your advantage isn’t knowing a pattern name—it’s knowing:# Methodology and Maturity (How to Interpret the Library)Not all patterns are equally validated. Treat maturity labels as guidance, and define criteria.A practical maturity rubric:: plausible, but limited evidence: at least one serious implementation write-up: multiple independent references and common usage: public evidence of real deployments + observed failure modes: convergent consensus across multiple credible sourcesIf you’re building production systems, bias toward:established / validated / best-practice
and treat emerging patterns as experiments.# Conclusion: Patterns Don’t Ship—Loops DoThe reason agentic work feels “magical” for some people and “useless” for others is rarely the model. It’s the loop.observability and stop conditionsThe 113 patterns in this library are a vocabulary and a toolbox. The real work is applying them to  constraints,  repo, and  risk tolerance.run the 30-minute workflowThat’s how you move from demos to production.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>cURL removes bug bounties</title><link>https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html</link><author>jnord</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:07:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Open source code library cURL is removing the possibility to earn money by reporting bugs, hoping that this will reduce the volume of AI slop reports. Joshua Rogers – AI wielding bug hunter of fame – thinks it's a great idea.cURL has been flooded with AI-generated error reports. Now one of the incentives to create them will go away.The vast majority of AI-generated error reports submitted to cURL are pure nonsense. Other open source projects are caught in the same pandemic.cURL maintainer Daniel Stenberg made an impact with his reporting on AI-generated bug reports last year – ”Death by a thousand slops.”Determining that they are nonsense is time-consuming, causing the maintainers lots of extra work.”AI slop and bad reports in general have been increasing even more lately, so we have to try to brake the flood in order not to drown”, says cURL maintainer Daniel Stenberg to Swedish electronics industry news site etn.se.Therefore, cURL is terminating the bounty payouts as of the end of January.“We hope this removes some of the incentives for people to send us garbage. We spend far too much time handling slop due to findings that are not real, exaggerated, or misunderstood.”Not all AI-generated bug reports are nonsense. It’s not possible to determine the exact share, but Daniel Stenberg knows of more than a hundred good AI assisted reports that led to corrections.In total, 87 bug reports to cURL have over the years amounted to USD 101,020 in bounties.How many of them would have gone under the radar if the bounty money had not existed?Interestingly, his reports were generated with the help of AI tools. But he doesn’t just vibe along in the dark — he reviews and adds to AI's analysis before submitting anything.Despite being an active code vulnerabilities hunter himself, he thinks removing the bounty money is a stellar idea ; something that should have been done a long time ago. He documented that view in a 2025 year-end posting.“I think it's a good move and worth a bigger consideration by others. It's ridiculous that it went on for so long to be honest, and I personally would have pulled the plug long ago,” he says to etn.se.But without the bounties an incentive to do code reviews disappears?”*An incentive*, but not all,” he comments, ”especially for anything that will be reported which actually matters”.So you think the effect won’t be that big?“Not much. The real incentive for finding a vulnerability in cURL is the fame ('brand is priceless'), not the hundred or few thousand dollars. $10,000 (maximum cURL bounty) is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, for somebody capable of finding a critical vulnerability in curl.”He realizes, though, that not everyone might share that attitude.“My view is that there is an asymmetric relationship between developers (open source or not) and so-called "security researchers" (or even real security researchers). Regardless of whether the researchers are in expensive or cheap countries, the value provided to the developer is the same. However, on the flipside, the value of a bounty is not the same for every reporter -- in low socio-economic locations, a reward which would be the cost of lunch in Sweden can be massive for those low socio-economic-located people,” says Joshua Rogers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Libbbf: Bound Book Format, A high-performance container for comics and manga</title><link>https://github.com/ef1500/libbbf</link><author>zdw</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:27:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Disaster planning for regular folks (2015)</title><link>https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/index-old.shtml</link><author>AlphaWeaver</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:38:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is an in-depth, data-packed guide
to rational emergency preparedness. The book offers deeper and more polished insights on most of the topics covered on this page. For example,
about 40 pages are devoted to financial planning alone - from cash reserves, to insurance policies, to commodity derivatives.

The prepper culture begs to be taken with a grain of salt. In the public
consciousness, its has all the makings of a doomsday cult:
a tribe of unkempt misfits who hoard gold bullion, study herbalism,
and preach about the imminent collapse of our society.

Today, most of us see such worries as absurd. It's not that life-altering disasters are
rare: every year, we hear about millions of people displaced by wildfires, earthquakes,
hurricanes, or floods. Heck, not a decade goes by without at least one first-class
democracy lapsing into armed conflict or fiscal disarray. But having grown up in a period
of prosperity and calm, we find it difficult to believe that an episode of bad weather or a currency crisis
could upend our lives.

I suspect that we dismiss such hazards not only because they seem surreal, but also because
worrying about them can make one feel helpless and lost. What's more, we tend to follow the
same instincts to tune out far more pedestrian and avoidable risks. For example, 
most of us don't plan ahead for losing a job, for dealing with a week-long water outage, or
for surviving the night if our home goes up in smoke.

Quite often, our singular strategy for dealing with such dangers is to hope for the
government to bail us out. But no matter if our elected officials prefer to school us with
passages from Milton Friendman or from Thomas Piketty, the hard truth is that no state can provide
a robust safety net for all of life's likely contingencies; in most places, government-run social
programs are severely deficient in funding, in efficiency, and in scope. Large-scale disasters
pit us against even worse odds. From New Orleans in 2005 to Fukushima in 2011, there are
countless stories of people left behind due to political dysfunction, poorly allocated
resources, or lost paperwork.

The purpose of this guide is to combat this mindset of learned helplessness by
promoting simple, level-headed, personal preparedness techniques that are easy to
implement, don't cost much, and will probably help cope with whatever life throws our way. 
More important, they don't get in the way of enjoying your everyday life - and instead of 
feeding anxieties, they should make it easier to detach from the doom-and-gloom of 24-hour news.
2. Mapping out the unknown 
Effective preparedness can be simple, but it has to be rooted in an honest and
systematic review of the risks one is likely to face. Plenty of newcomers begin
by shopping for ballistic vests and night vision goggles; they would be better
served by grabbing a fire extinguisher, some bottled water, and then putting the rest of
their money in a rainy-day fund.

To avoid being overwhelmed when trying to enumerate risks, I found that it's best to focus on
broad outcomes instead of trying to envision every single way for things to go south.
For example, it should not matter if one is laid off because of a downsizing, because
their new boss hates them, or because the coworkers finally catch them stealing paperclips. The
outcome is the same: they are out of a job and urgently need a way to pay the bills.

In the end, a careful examination of our daily routines and their failure modes tends to offer
better payoff than getting bogged down with long-winded hypotheticals. Another common distraction is
the desire to immediately figure out how to respond to all the scenarios we end up dreaming of. Let's save that for later;
by prematurely focusing on the second half of the problem, we may end up glossing over some of the less tractable scenarios
- or make haphazard assumptions that will cloud our judgment in other ways.

I also believe that to come up with a rational threat model, we need to think of "risk" as a product of
both the probability and the consequences of a given event. By that metric, stubbed toes
and zombie outbreaks are equally uninteresting; one of them has nearly zero significance,
the other, nearly zero odds. The non-recoverable cost of mitigations matters, too. Some expenses
can't be recouped if a disaster does not come.

What else? Ah, right: the final heuristic I'd recommend is to keep things uncomplicated. There are
popular doomsday predictions that deal with cutting-edge particle physics, god-like computer
hackers, vast government conspiracies, or extraterrestrial messages hidden in pop songs. I suppose
we can't  rule that stuff out, but historical data suggests that there's a lot more
merit in worrying about falling off a ladder or getting hit by a car.

 With these caveats in mind, let's go over some canonical scenarios that are worth thinking about.
2.1. Problem space #1: Small-scale events 
It can be fun to speculate about solar flares and supervolcanoes; it's far more mind-numbing to
seriously evaluate the consequences of backed up sewage or burst water mains. But in reality,
such unglamorous, small-scale incidents that do not make the news are far more likely to disrupt and reshape
our lives.

Broadly speaking, disastrous outcomes of such humdrum contingencies can be divided into
several groups:

  If a person over the age of 40 tells you that they have never lost a job, they are
  pretty lucky (or lying). Yet, the risk is seldom taken seriously; many middle-class,
  single-income families would be in trouble after even a very brief period of unemployment.
  Even in the $100,000+ income bracket, living paycheck-to-paycheck is a common thing.
Disrupted access to water, food, energy, or transportation.
  Substantial and prolonged outages happen everywhere; many of us will experience
  at least one at some point in our lives. A week without electricity may be just
  inconvenient and scary, especially in a high-rise or
  in a seedy neighborhood. But other services can be more critical:
   even a single hot day without potable water is really bad news.

  Every year, there are over 350,000 house fires in the United States. Such accidents
  usually aren't deadly - but if you are unlucky, they can leave you stranded in the middle
  of the night in your PJs, with no documents or credit cards in hand. Insurance can help,
  but even in simple cases, it takes time to get the final payout, and it takes months to
  rebuild.

  Largely preventable and predictable incidents - such as falls, vehicle collisions, and poisonings -
  account for some 40 million ER visits annually. It can be argued that people are sometimes too
  quick to rush to the hospital, but said incidents also result in about 100,000 US
  deaths every year.
Intentionally inflicted harm.
  Violent crime is essentially  almost everywhere in the world.
  In the US in the 90s, your lifetime likelihood of victimization was
  estimated to be around 80%; the odds of suffering criminal injury hovered at 40%. More recent
  research is hard to come by - but scary or even life-threatening encounters remain a very real risk.
Debilitating illness or death.
  It's going to get us; maybe next week, maybe in 50 years. We can't really predict the day,
  but we can understand and meaningfully manage the impact it will have on those who depend on us -
  say, our stay-at-home partners or young kids. Probate cases often drag on for a year or more and
  involve substantial fees; in contrast, setting up your finances correctly may take as little as
  10-15 minutes to complete a simple online form.

All in all, the risks discussed in this section have three defining characteristics: they are relatively
likely to happen; are strikingly easy to mitigate (we'll get into that soon); and tend to be so
unglamorous that they seldom make the cut in any "serious" guide to emergency preparedness.
2.2. Problem space #2: Mass calamities 
If an errant backhoe took out the utilities for your block, you would probably head to the
grocery store to pick up bottled water (and use their restrooms, too). But if a
once-in-a-century storm damaged major roads and left half the city without running water, your
options wouldn't be as clear-cut.

That's why we have to look at larger-scale emergencies through somewhat different lens, taking into
account their likely magnitude, duration, and the nature of the forces at play. Some of the
plausible scenarios to think about include:

  Common examples include floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, and heatwaves. In some
  regions, such events are fairly rare; in others, they are almost guaranteed every decade or two. But no matter where you
  live, you should expect at least one "storm of the century", "winter of the century", or "drought of the century" to happen
  within your the span of your life.

  Many people live in the proximity of heavy industries - say, refineries, freight railroads, or power plants.
  Depending on the type of industrial facilities nearby, it may make sense to evaluate the potential
  consequences of upwind and upstream explosions or chemical spills. Contrary to pop cultural fears, conventional
  industries, such as chemical plants, have a track record far more grim than Fukushima and Chernobyl.

  Riots are a distinct risk in many urban and suburban areas around the world. When angry mobs
  take to the streets, widespread arson and violent crime are not unheard of, sometimes going
  on for days or weeks. While you probably won't have to fight off an angry mob in a residential
  neighborhood, there might be times when it's wise to skip some grocery store trips and hunker down.

  All highly developed countries go through cyclic recessions and periods of high unemployment;
  the US had about ten big ones in the past 100 years alone. Sometimes, such events
  are accompanied by bank runs and collapses of financial institutions; other times,
  they involve hyperinflation, product rationing, deposit confiscations, or currency controls.

  It's been a while since the highly developed world experienced a devastating outbreak, but it
  may be premature to flat out dismiss the risk. In 1918, an unusual strain of flu managed to kill 75
  million people. Few years later, a mysterious sleeping sickness - probably also of viral origin -
  swept the globe, crippling millions, some for life. We aren't necessarily better prepared
  for similar events today.
Terrorism or conventional war.
  History books make us think we would see it coming - but in practice,
  such events are difficult to
  anticipate tend to catch nations off guard. These phenomena are noteworthy not only because of their immediate death toll,
  which can be relatively low - but because of the far-reaching and long-term socioeconomic
  disruption they can cause. The fears of terrorism are often dismissed as irrational, as relatively few people are killed
  by terrorists and very few terror campaigns achieve their ultimate goals; but in terms of the profound
  economic and societal impacts such attacks can have, they are worth factoring into any preparedness plan.

Most of readers will probably not get tangled up in a large-scale disaster of any sort, but it
is wise to hedge our bets. There are countless examples to demonstrate that such events
happen often and can strike close to home - say:

The EU debt crisis, from 2009 onward. A series of events that led to staggering unemployment rates
in Greece, deposit confiscations in Cyprus, and uncertain prospects for the entire
eurozone.

Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Damaged more than 300,000 homes in the US, left millions 
without power - some for weeks.

The California wildfires of 2007. The blaze destroyed thousands of homes and forced
1 million SoCal residents to seek improvised shelter at stadiums and schools.

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Put 80% of New Orleans under water, stranded
countless motorists when 3 million people attempted to evacuate.

A decade of social unrest in France, from 2005 on. A series of widespread
urban riots led to more than 13,000 cars being torched and hundreds of structures
damaged or destroyed.

The European heatwave of 2003. A seemingly benign weather anomaly killed tens of thousands -
mostly in highly developed and wealthy countries, such as France and Spain.

The Los Angeles riots of 1992. A startling rampage that resulted in about 2,000 injuries,
4,500 structures being looted, and some 1,000 buildings set ablaze.

Preparing for such emergencies may seem exceedingly difficult, but much can be
accomplished with very simple tools. For example, if you own a car, always keeping
the tank at least half full, and having a small box of rudimentary supplies in your
trunk, can go a long way. Again, we'll go over many other low-cost preparedness
strategies soon.
2.3. Problem space #3: The zombie apocalypse 
Many of the best-known works of science fiction explore the possibility that one day,
perhaps soon, the very fabric of our society may simply unravel - and that those who
survive The Event would be forced to fend for themselves in a ravaged and hostile world.

To connect with the reader, the writers of such post-apocalyptic fiction skillfully play up
contemporary fears, often implying that we may be on the verge of an extinction event or a
fundamental societal shift. The usual literary themes include:

It's no wonder that all this vivid imagery keeps many preppers preoccupied with civilization-ending events.
Some of their worries are based on patently absurd or exaggerated science; some are valid, but rather
unlikely to materialize within the span of our lives; and many others boil down to interesting but 
somewhat idle speculation, devoid of quantifiable risk or historical precedent.

At least in theory, the recipe for surviving civilizational collapse is simple: we need to get away
from other people and become self-sufficient. It's fairly clear that deprived of their industrial
backbone, most of our cities and suburbs wouldn't be able to support even a tiny fraction of their
current population densities - and would become horrid death traps. Living off the grid shields
you from all but the worst doomsday events.

My thinking is simple: if farming is your cup of tea, buy a plot of land in the countryside.
But if you'd rather live the rest of your days without having to skin deer or plow a field,
it probably pays to focus on better quantified and substantiated risks - and not let asteroids or space zombies
keep us up at night.
3. The prepared lifestyle 
Of course, there is no use in worrying about the hypotheticals if we're not going to actually tackle the
risks. But it pays to be smart about it, too: when it comes to emergency preparedness, the
right mindset can matter a lot more than a small fortune spent on ninja gear and canned cheese.
So, before going on a shopping spree, let's talk about several simple, everyday principles
that can shield us from harm.

Much of the content in this section has little to do with hardcore prepping; some of the chapters
touch on seemingly banal topics, such as financial planning, community building, or the prevention
of burglaries and car wrecks. We have all heard most of this advice before - but if we are serious
about risk minimization, one must internalize these rules, understand where they are coming from,
and actually live by them every day.
3.1. Prepper commandment #1: Save some money 
Some are born into familial wealth or who display supernatural business acumen. Then
there is the rest of us, perhaps having robust and satisfying careers, but ultimately
never getting far enough from the steep cliffs of financial misery.
It may be a matter of our employer going out of business, it may be a shift in
the job market, an illness, or a legal dispute - but in all likelihood, it would not take much to
push us off the ledge. I have friends who lived paycheck-to-paycheck on cozy Silicon Valley
salaries of $150k+ a year, only to lose their cars and homes in the midst of the 2007
financial crisis - having found out the hard way that unemployment benefits in the San Francisco
Bay Area max out at $450 a week, not nearly enough to pay their mortgages or make the rent.

I can't claim to have advice for people who are already in a tough spot: if your
household earnings are well below median, you may simply have no disposable income to build
a personal safety net. But for most other folks, the ability to prepare for the zero-income
contingency should be within reach. Sure, even a lifetime
of belt-tightening won't make the average middle-class family fabulously rich. But rainy-day funds
work in a different way: their purpose is to get us through a rough spell, not to pay for a
mansion or a fancy car. Since the amount needed is directly proportional to how much we currently
make, it makes relatively little difference if your household brings in $70k or $140k a year.
Either way, if you set aside 10% of every post-tax paycheck, you should have a 6-month financial
safety net established within 3 years and a change.

This, of course, is easier said than done. We tend to scale up our living expenses in proportion to
earned income, so even among the top 1% of wage earners, people living paycheck-to-paycheck are not a rare sight.
And it's usually not the big-ticket stuff that gets them: we're far more likely to overspend on all
the smaller, habitual purchases, because their cumulative cost is less apparent - and potential
savings are much easier to miss. The patterns to look for will depend on your lifestyle and on how
much you make, but here are several suggestions for where to search for that 10%:


It pays to shop at less expensive grocery stores and try out lower-shelf brands - especially when
it comes to commodities such as cooking oil, paper towels, milk, seltzer water, flour, sugar,
or salt. I'd wager that table salt tastes and works the same, whether we paid $1 at Walmart or $15 for a
Sherpa-approved Himalayan variety at Whole Foods. Groceries eat up a good chunk of our
monthly budgets, so even seemingly inconsequential savings tend to add up very fast.
Even shaving just $15 or $20 off every grocery bill can add up to $1,000-$2,000 extra cash every year.


Many young, urban-dwelling folks frequently dine at restaurants, go to clubs, or take cabs
around town. They don't need to give it all up, but it may make sense to scale back slightly by
designating several days a week strictly for public transport and home food. Contemporary
frozen dinners can be surprisingly tasty, and Netflix has some good shows.


If our older phone, laptop, or a TV set are still working fine, it pays to keep them for another year or two.
The excitement of new gear wears off quickly, usually in a matter of days or weeks, so it can actually
be liberating to fall behind. There are entire communities
of computer gamers who only play games at least one year old, and they seem as happy as people living on the cutting edge of tech.


Small monthly fees add up to gargantuan sums over the years, so it's good to take a critical look at
cable TV, landlines, gym memberships, and so on. Downgrading to a slower speed for Internet service or
slightly increasing the deductible on car insurance can result in significant savings, too. Insurance
works best when it's purchased for unlikely and catastrophic losses; it's not a cost-effective way to pay for
broken side mirrors, cracked windshields, and so on.


Even renters can save big bucks by learning how to reupholster or refinish
furniture, patch drywall, paint walls and trim, install tile and cabinets, fix or replace faucets,
unclog drains, and take care of other simple DIY jobs. In addition to saving a lot of money,
home improvement can be incredibly rewarding, too.


Camping trips can be a good alternative to heading off to a popular destination like Vegas, Hawaii,
or Disneyland. Although it's nice to have a variety of experiences, by the end of the day,
trips that involve less stress and less planning can be more enjoyable than high-stakes exotic
getaways.


If you get a bonus or a raise at work, it's good to resist the urge to spend it right away.
Consistently setting aside some or all of the extra income can pay off over time, and helps
combat the phenomenon of lifestyle creep.

Somewhat counterintuitively, saving money is not just about cutting down expenses;
seeing a higher balance on a checking account can instinctively make us less frugal, too. To
counter this trend, I found it helpful to set up a small, daily transfer to
a savings account, in an amount that blends in with daily purchases - say, $10 or so. This
method takes much less planning and mental discipline than trying to make one big deposit every
month. And hey - once we are comfortable with $10, we can painlessly test the limits by
gently ramping the amount up.

Debt should be approached with suspicion. Many of us are taught that owing money is normal, even
desirable; indeed, for middle-class folks, some forms of indebtedness may be difficult
to avoid. But unnecessarily accrued debt cuts into your bottom line in two insidious ways.
First of all, monthly installment payments limit your flexibility in an emergency - so if your
income shrinks, your savings will be depleted at a merciless and non-negotiable rate. Secondly,
high-interest loans, such as credit cards, amount to giving out a good chunk of your income
without earning anything useful in return. They are akin to voluntarily accepting a pay cut.

As a matter of practicality, I wouldn't worry too much about your existing mortgages or student
loans: they are difficult to repay early, tend to have very low interest, and confer special
tax benefits. But I'd use your initial savings to pay off credit card balances, and do it quick.
It pays to be careful with new obligations, too. Unless you already have a very generous safety net, a
home loan that eats up more than 15% of your paycheck over the course of 30 years is a
very risky deal; and going over 30% is almost certainly a bad idea, at least as far as financial
continuity planning goes.

As for the optimal size of your emergency fund, there are no hard rules. Around six months'
worth of post-tax earnings should provide a very comfortable cushion for short- and medium-term
disasters of all sorts. Even in a deeper crisis, six months is plenty of time to scale down
expenses, find a new line of work, or regroup in some other way.

Now, chances are, if you follow the advice contained in this section, you will not feel an urge to ramp
up spending the moment you hit the 6-month mark. If so, it's best to keep going; with the initial rainy-day fund
established and good fiscal habits in place, you can start treating the extra funds with more
flexibility - for example, "borrowing" against them to self-finance larger purchases, or aiming
to retire a bit earlier and a bit more comfortably than the government expects you to. And by the
time your savings are sufficient to get you through a full year of unemployment, I bet that your
outlook on life, work, and personal finance will change in an interesting way. There is a good
if somewhat foul-mouthed essay on this, called
"A Story of a Fuck-Off Fund".

Oh, one more thing: when trying to reform your fiscal habits, it can be useful to think of money as
a unit of debt owed to you by the society, awarded in exchange for your hard work (or as a consequence
of some other fortuitous event). Despite the
popular saying, when allocated wisely, that money can buy you safety, comfort, influence, or true
friendship and happiness. It would be foolish to squander it on trinkets - just as it would be
foolish to take it with you to the grave. My advice is simple: make every transaction count.
3.2. Prepper commandment #2: Don't lose what you saved 
If all goes well, your rainy-day fund will eventually grow big enough for you to face an
 important question: how do I keep all that capital safe? Although it may seem like a remote
concern, events such as bank collapses, market crashes, and currency devaluations happen all over the
world with near-clockwork regularity - and there are few things more infuriating and disenfranchising
than finding out that the fruits of many years of your labor have been wiped out by a market panic or
an administrative decree.

The answer to the question of safeguarding your wealth lies in the solution
to another riddle: the mechanism by which the society determines the worth of a piece of money to
begin with. It's a puzzle central not only to everyday financial planning, but also to any attempts
to decipher and meaningfully evaluate countless mainstream conspiracy theories and doomsday
predictions related to the financial world.

So, let's start from the beginning! Throughout much of the recorded history, the monetary systems of the
western world employed so-called , generally settling on coins minted out of
silver or gold. The two metals were favored because of their nearly universal appeal, and because of their
inherently constrained, labor-intensive supply. In this system, early prices likely reflected
the worth of a particular good compared to the valuation of the coin as a non-monetary commodity. Over
time, the exact "melt value" of the coins started to matter less, and the currency functioned as a more
abstract unit of account - but its precious metal content stabilized the economy by ensuring that
the coinage had an inherent and lasting value, even if the issuing state simply vanished from the map.

By the 18th or 19th century, many European countries moved on to a more flexible model where coins were made out
of cheaper metals, and banknotes were printed on paper or cloth. To encourage the use of these new instruments
and to establish their value, the governments or the issuing banks promised to freely exchange such intrinsically worthless tokens
for a predefined amount of gold. In other words, as long as people had faith in their rulers or financial
institutions, the fundamental mechanics of this new  remained roughly the same as before.

In theory, both of these systems looked simple and robust. But there was another, somethwat subversive
force at play:
in the 17th century, many European states witnessed the emergence of fractional-reserve banks.
These private ventures operated according to a simple scheme: they accepted people's money for
safekeeping, promising to pay a premium on every deposit made. To meet these obligations and to make
a profit, the banks then used the pooled deposits to make high-interest loans to other
folks. The financiers figured out that under normal circumstances and when operating at a sufficient
scale, they needed only a very modest reserve - well under 10% of all deposited money - to be able to
service the usual volume and size of withdrawals requested by their customers. The rest could
be loaned out.

The very curious consequence of fractional-reserve banking was that it pulled new money out of thin air. The funds were
simultaneously accounted for in the statements shown to the depositor, evidently available for withdrawal or
transfer at any
time; and given to third-party borrowers, who could spend them on just about anything. Heck, the borrowers
could deposit the proceeds in another bank, creating even more money along the way! Whatever they did,
the sum of all funds in the monetary system now appeared much higher than the value of all coins and
banknotes issued by the government.

Of course, no new money was being created in any physical sense: all that banks were doing was
engaging in a bit of creative accounting - the sort of which would probably land you in jail if you 
attempted it in any other comparably vital field of enterprise. If too many depositors were to
ask for their money back, or if too many loans were to go bad, the banking system would fold.
Fortunes would evaporate in a puff of accounting smoke, and with the disappearance of vast
quantities of quasi-fictitious ("broad") money, the wealth of the entire nation would shrink.

In the early 20th century, the world kept witnessing just that; a series of bank runs and economic contractions
forced the governments around the globe to act. At that stage, outlawing fractional-reserve
banking was no longer politically or economically tenable; a simpler alternative was to let
go of gold and move to  - a currency implemented as an abstract social construct measuring
indebtedness, with no predefined connection to the physical realm. A new breed of economists saw the role of the government
not in trying to peg the value of money to an inflexible commodity, but in manipulating its supply
to smooth out economic hiccups or to stimulate growth. Depending on who you ask today,
contemporary monetary policies - especially in the era of bank bailouts and debt-fueled GDP boosting -
are either a brilliant way to stabilize free markets and promote wealth, or a reckless charade
that papers over systemic problems and sets us up for serious trouble in the coming years.

That question aside, the obvious peril of fiat money is that in the long haul, its value is determined
strictly by people's willingness to accept a piece of paper in exchange for their trouble; that
willingness, in turn, is conditioned solely on their belief that the same piece of paper would buy them
something nice a week, a month, or a year from now. It follows that a simple crisis of confidence could make a
currency nearly worthless overnight. A prolonged period of hyperinflation and subsequent austerity in Germany and Austria
was one of the precipitating factors that led to World War II. In
more recent times, dramatic episodes of hyperinflation plagued the fiat currencies of Argentina (1980s),
Italy (1980s), Israel (1984), Mexico (1988), Poland (1990), Yugoslavia (1994), Bulgaria (1996), Bolivia (1990s),
Turkey (2002), Zimbabwe (2009), Venezuela (2016), and quite a few other nations around the globe. The scale of
this phenomenon is surprisingly poorly studied in English-language literature, but at least 56 instances are
documented, most of them within the past 100 years; you can check out some examples here.

For the United States, the switch to fiat money came relatively late, in 1971. To stop the
dollar from plunging like a rock, the Nixon administration employed a clever trick:
they ordered the freeze of wages and prices for the 90 days that immediately followed the move.
People went on about their lives and paid the usual for eggs or milk - and by the time
the freeze ended, they were accustomed to the idea that the "new", free-floating dollar is worth about
the same as the old, gold-backed one. A robust economy and favorable geopolitics did the rest, and so far,
the American adventure with fiat currency has been rather uneventful - perhaps except for the fact
that the price of gold itself skyrocketed from $35 per troy ounce in 1971 to $850 in 1980 (or, from
$210 to $2,500 in today's dollars).

Well, one thing did change: now better positioned to freely tamper with the supply of money, the regulators
in accord with the bankers adopted a policy of creating it at a rate that slightly outstripped the organic
growth in economic activity. They did this to induce a small, steady degree of inflation, believing that doing
so would discourage people from hoarding cash and force them to reinvest it for the betterment of the society.
Some critics point out that such a policy functions as a "backdoor" tax on savings that happens to align with
the regulators' less noble interests; still, either way: in the US and most other developed nations, the
purchasing power of any money kept under a mattress will drop at a rate of somewhere between 2 to 10% a year.

All right. Financial systems are messy. Fiat money and fractional-reserve banking, although
wildly successful, can fail in interesting and horrific ways. Foreign trade, neglected here but absolutely
vital for most European countries, adds even more variables to the mix. So, let's talk about what can be done
to protect your rainy-day funds against some of the most likely or most talked-about risks.
3.2.1. Fiscal challenge #1: Dealing with "normal" inflation 
At a rate of 4%, inflation will halve the purchasing power of your savings in about 17 years; at 6%,
the process will take just 11 years and a change. Worse yet, depending on your location and lifestyle choices,
the inflation rate you experience can be much higher than the nation-wide government numbers imply. For example,
the skyrocketing housing prices in the SF Bay Area have halved the purchasing power of some aspiring
homeowners in a matter of five years or so, even though the official inflation figures hovered during that
period somewhere around 2%.

In any case, while it's seldom a prepper-grade emergency, you probably need to tackle the problem of inflation
sooner than later - or face huge and unnecessary losses down the road.

For our parents, the solution was simple: they had to take their money to a bank. The returns were usually sufficient
to offset the loss, and since the value of their money already depended on the health of the financial system, they
weren't facing that much added risk. But today, the trick no longer works: people are skittish about the state of
the economy and are trying to play it safe, so banks already have more deposits than they can use - and offer
near-zero interest rates across much of the developed world.

There are many other ways to get returns on your capital, but most are associated with limited liquidity or
significant outlay costs. One well-known exception are publicly traded companies. Businesses usually go public because
they want to expand their operations - say, build a new factory or hire more workers. Instead of getting an
expensive loan, they put themselves up for sale, allowing people to purchase and trade fractional ownership in the company.
The investors' willingness to pay for this privilege depends on two factors: the intrinsic value of the enterprise
(its assets, debts, revenue streams) that they get a claim on if the company goes private, is acquired, or liquidates;
and the "hype premium" - the faith in the company's long-term prospects and the health of the entire industry. For some 
companies, the intrinsic value is modest, and the premium is huge; their shares are usually subject to violent price
swings on even seemingly minor macroeconomic news. For other, less exciting businesses, the situation may be the opposite.

The conundrum of owning stock is that it serves as a hedge against inflation only in an otherwise viable economy.
At the first sight of serious economic trouble, the premiums paid on corporate stocks take a nosedive and not recover for
months or years; in a genuine downturn, the intrinsic value of many companies will also shrink. Since a downturn
is probably the time when you will need your rainy-day money the most, it's important to play it safe. Putting somewhere
around 30-40% of your emergency stash into the stock market may be a good call. Going all in is a very risky bet,
since in an economic crisis, it's not rare to see stock indices plunge 50%.

The fundamental rule is to not be greedy: within the scope of this guide, your goal should
be to preserve capital, not to take wild risks. It's best to pick about 10-20 boring
companies that seem to be valued fairly,
that are free of crippling debt, and that have robust prospects for the coming years. I'd stay clear of financial enterprises,
of highly speculative sectors such as biotech, cannabis, or solar power, and of heavily regulated industries that lack the flexibility to
deal with sudden economic shifts (say, airlines). Relatively safe picks can be found in no-frills
domains: basic chemicals, staple electronic components, profitable freight railways, mechanical assembly
manufacturing, home and office supplies, and so on.

It is worth noting that many personal finance experts advise against hand-picking your investments. Instead,
they advocate a process known as "indexing": buying into an investment vehicle comprising hundreds of stocks, 
structured to represent the stock market as a whole. The proponents of indexing have a point: most people who try to pick
individual winners in the stock market usually fare no better than an index fund. But in the context of prepping, I think
this is advice is flawed. To remain calm in tumultuous times, it is important to maintain a firm grasp of the merits of your
investments. One can convincingly reason about the financial condition, the valuation, or the long-term prospects of a paper mill;
the same can't be said of an S&P 500 index fund - which, among other things, contains the shares of
about a hundred global financial conglomerates.
3.2.2. Fiscal challenge #2: Having no access to your bank account 
Sooner or later, you may find yourself unable to access your bank deposits for a couple of days or
weeks. It could be a matter of IT trouble at your bank, of a lost wallet, or of being a victim of identity
theft. Heck, take Greece or Cyprus: when the confidence in the nation's financial institutions is shattered, it's
easy to get caught up in government-imposed bank closures and withdrawal controls. (Folks in the United
States may also recall the forced closure of Washington Mutual in 2008, or several state-level "bank holidays"
imposed to combat bank runs during the savings & loan crisis back in the 80s.)

For short-term survival, simple solutions work best: just keep about 2-4 weeks' worth of cash somewhere at hand;
have enough money on you to get you back home when traveling, too. Of course, be mindful of the risk of burglary, so if
you're keeping the funds at home, pick an unobvious location for the stash; more about that soon.

As for the remainder of your money, I suggest splitting it across two largely unrelated financial institutions with
different risk profiles - say,
a big national bank and a local credit union. As long as the deposits are insured by the government (as they
normally are in the US and in Europe, up to a per-account limit), this
approach greatly increases the availability of your money, and probably doesn't expose you to any substantially new dangers.
Keeping all your savings outside the banking system is an option, too, but it's not necessarily a smart choice.
With fiat currencies, this move does not truly insulate you from that many longer-term risks, but adds the very real
possibility of losing all your funds to fire or theft.

Perhaps of note: over the past 5 years, many European governments have moved to
severely restrict the use of cash by imposing per-transaction or daily limits as low as $1,000.
The stated reasons have to do with money laundering and tax evasion, but such measures broadly
make it harder to store or use physical currency, even if you're not doing anything wrong.
In the US, some cash transactions over $10,000 are subject to reporting, too.
3.2.3. Fiscal challenge #3: Dodging hyperinflation and "bail-ins" 
Ask a financial advisor about the possibility, and they will probably recommend keeping some of your funds
overseas. But the odds aren't great of correctly picking a currency with more staying power
than the one in which you get paid. Historically, the Swiss franc had a reputation for being an exceptionally
safe choice, in part because of being the last major currency still quasi-pegged to gold; but Switzerland
abolished this requirement in a referendum around the year 2000.

Another complication is that even if you make the right call, many governments impose onerous reporting
requirements on foreign assets - and especially in times of economic hardship, they treat them with
suspicion and contempt. Host countries are also more cavalier about confiscating foreign deposits,
as evidenced by the Cypriot "bail-ins" in 2013. Lastly, the public associates overseas accounts with
tax evasion and money laundering, so it may be difficult to garner any sympathy for your case when
things go wrong.

One school of thought popular in the prepper community is to convert some of your savings into commodity
metals: copper, tin, silver, platinum, palladium, and the likes. All of them are easy to store, last
indefinitely, and will certainly hold value far better than a fiat currency in free fall. On the flip side,
you may still need to accept substantial loss: an economic collapse will disrupt industrial demand,
causing the prices of many such commodities to slump.

This brings us to gold: this metal occupies an interesting niche, because its value is driven chiefly
not by industrial applications, but by direct consumer demand and by its status as a mainstream financial
instrument. In fact, investors and governments alike frequently flock to it in times of economic uncertainty and
stagnation,
as they did in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007. Of course, this goes both ways: should the economy
pick up steam, the demand may decrease and the currently elevated prices of gold may fall closer to their
historical, inflation-adjusted average of perhaps $800-$1,000 per troy oz. Still, the metal is an interesting 
hedge against economic disasters, especially given that it is very easily bought and sold. If you are worried
about hyperinflation, you may want to convert some of your savings into this shiny commodity, although I
wouldn't go over 20-30% or so, as the poorly-characterized volatility of metal prices can sting
in the short haul.

Because of its very high value-to-volume ratio, physical gold is stored and moved around very easily, but keeping substantial
amounts at home can be ill-advised; theft is a very real risk, and most insurance policies will not adequately
cover the loss. Safe deposit boxes at a local bank, available for around $20 a year, are usually a better
alternative - although they come with some trade-offs; for example, the access to deposit boxes was
restricted by the government during the Greek debt crisis in 2015. Non-bank storage services do not have
that problem, but cost quite a bit more.
3.2.4. Fiscal challenge #4: Oh no! Zombie apocalypse! 
The global financial system simply disappears. Mutant hordes roam the earth!

The preservation of wealth after a civilization-ending event is a popular topic of idle banter in the
prepper community. Some folks believe that commodities such as silver and gold would return as the basis of
a primitive post-apocalyptic economy - and if we're wildly speculating, in the longer haul, that seems like
a somewhat plausible guess. But in the immediate aftermath, it seems more likely that economic activity would be minimal and
limited to barter or communal ledgers. Nobody would want to exchange a candy bar for a gold coin if they
can't be sure about being able to find any other food.

This may sound like a good argument for putting all your money into freeze-dried meals, medicine, shovels,
and other survival supplies. But of course, that decision would become a huge liability should the
apocalypse not come, or simply not come soon enough: you probably can't pay a roofer or a dentist with a
pallet of ammo, cigarettes, and canned ham.

Here's my advice: keep the bulk of your savings in cash, stocks, real estate, or other assets you can easily liquidate
or put to use today; even if you genuinely worry about the apocalypse, plan to spend no more than 2-4% of
your money on essential prepper supplies. When the zombies come, your financial instruments will almost certainly
become worthless; but you better believe that the value of your survival gear will increase 100-fold.
Zombies or not, your net worth will be safe. Your delicious, tasty brains - well, that's something to
worry about!
3.3. Prepper commandment #3: Learn new skills 
In the 90s, it seemed that one couldn't go wrong getting into professional journalism,
opening a video rental store or an arcade, or selling calculators, encyclopedias, disposable
cameras, answering machines, and audio CDs. We would be very naive to hope that the next twenty
years will not bring similarly dramatic disruption to many of the seemingly cozy professions of today.

So, here's another suggestion for building a comprehensive preparedness plan: it's good to develop
and maintain useful and marketable secondary skills. A simple and enjoyable way of doing so is to pick a
hobby we can get passionate about - and then work hard, be very honest about your own mistakes and
shortcomings, and try to get better at it every week. One probably shouldn't
seek immediate profits, since progressing from a hobby to a paid occupation inevitably takes away some
of the fun; but it helps to gravitate toward pursuits that could conceivably morph into viable career
choices within a decade or so. For families, it can be good to encourage spouses or children to pursue
thoughtful hobbies of their own, too.

The value of such a step extends beyond the mere task of shielding you from glacial shifts in the job market: if
a major disaster suddenly cripples the local economy, there may be no more jobs for HR specialists 
or account executives, but carpentry or metalworking skills could be in high demand for the coming
year or two. You can never predict it exactly, but the more you can do, the better you can cope with
whatever adventures come your way.

When it comes to recommendations, there is no short list of hobbies that are objectively better than the rest; the selection is vast,
and the right choice will inevitably depend on your own interests, natural talents, the space you have
available, and on countless other constraints. That said, here are some fairly popular options that may
be worth thinking about:

Not all of these hobbies can be turned into well-paying gigs unless you truly excel at them - but they
are guaranteed to be challenging, meaningful, and fun. The Internet gives you ample opportunities to
learn from others, compare notes, and get feedback on your work - all without prematurely subjecting
yourself to the pressures of the commercial marketplace.

Of course, marketable hobbies aside, some of the more determined preppers pursue interests such as
martial arts, pro marksmanship, bushcraft, paramilitary combat tactics, and other extreme survival strategies.
Such talents can be quite useful in a couple of plausible if unlikely scenarios - but their major
disadvantage is that during a simple economic downturn, they won't put bread on the table or pay your bills.
It's not unwise to give them some consideration, but be sure to balance it with more pragmatic skills.
3.4. Prepper commandment #4: Don't hurt yourself 
Unintentional injury may seem like a topic unbecoming a true prepper, but even the most hardcore survivalist may
find it hard to live out a
post-apocalyptic Mad Max fantasy with a bum leg or a broken neck; and more prosaically, serious prior injury
may limit your ability to provide for yourself and your family, confront a burglar, or get out of a burning
home. It may seem like a far-fetched worry, but - as noted earlier -
the lifetime probability of suffering some form of harm is much greater than we intuitively suspect.

Now, there are some dangers to life and limb that we simply can't predict or prevent: the occasional falling piano,
the murderous roommate, the untimely stroke. Then there are the risks we take on purpose, accepting
the inherent and unavoidable trade-offs of our hobbies or jobs: the possibility of being snatched by a giant squid
while snorkeling off the coast of California, or the near-certainty of lung fibrosis from toiling in a 
sugar mine. These are the things we can't or don't want to give up - and that's perfectly fine.

But there are also the "hold my beer" moments: the unnecessary displays of bravado, overconfidence, or
thoughtlessness. We recognize them from cringeworthy Youtube clips of people getting hurt -
but we are guilty of the same: we get honked at for carelessly changing lanes, we end up climbing more than
a fair share of rickety ladders and office chairs, and every now and then, we all get a bit cavalier with
lawnmowers, escalators, ATVs, or other power tools.

We keep getting away with all that goofiness, and that only serves to make us more certain that our own
transgressions carry no serious risks. But government statistics tell a strikingly different tale: in the US
alone, unintentional injuries result in 40 million ER visits and 100,000 deaths every year. Heck, accidental
injury is the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 1 and 45 - far ahead of cancer, heart disease,
gun violence, and other pop culture bogeymen. And the injuries themselves are very prosaic, too: all you see
are falls from modest heights, cuts, burns, vehicular collisions, poisonings, and so forth. The "idiots" we
sometimes watch on Youtube are us. They just happen to have been caught on camera on the day their luck ran out, perhaps aided by
downing a couple of beers.

In the end, ladders, cars, and space heaters are a much greater threat to our well-being than a gun-toting
robber or an army of zombie marauders could ever be. So, gleaned from accident statistics, here are some of
the familiar-sounding but crucial survival tips. It may sound unlikely, but if something appears on this
list, it's responsible for quite a few gruesome deaths or injuries every year; it pays to take it to heart.
3.4.1. Safety tip #1: Don't be stupid when working at heights 
Working at heights can be a prime example of an unnecessary risk: sure, 
the lightbulb needs changing and that office chair is really close, but it would take us just 15 more 
seconds more to bring a more sturdy stool from another room. Similarly,
having someone hold a wobbly ladder for us or securing it with some rope can be a minor hurdle - but it's gonna be
much less of a hurdle than dealing with a compound fracture or a dent in one's skull.

Whenever working at heights, it's good to remember that we
probably experienced most of our falls as children, and that can profoundly skew one's perception of danger: falling five feet
and landing on your side is different when you weigh 50 lbs, and different when you are 180 lbs.
3.4.2. Safety tip #2: Drive defensively and stay calm on the road 
Car accidents are a major source of injuries, and the methods to mitigate the risk are familiar to most:
don't go too fast, keep a three-second distance to the vehicle in front of you, and always scan
for cross traffic when approaching intersections or making turns (other drivers may be less attentive than
you). It's also good to be very careful when changing lanes, do it slowly, and be sure to adjust one's
mirrors to eliminate blind spots (you don't really need to see the sides of your car). Next, it's worthwhile
to slow down for cars stopped in other lanes - they may be letting a pedestrian through. Finally,
there are clear benefits to wearing seat belts, keeping children in fitting car seats,
getting some rest on longer trips, and not talking on the phone - it doesn't matter that it's hands-free.
I'd avoid frequent rides with people who drive badly, too.

Interestingly, driving and safeguarding your finances have something in common: when you end up hurting
another person in an at-fault accident, they may go after your savings or real estate to recoup medical
expenses, lost wages, and other costs. So, in addition to driving defensively, it makes sense to take a look at your insurance
policy. The minimum liability coverage mandated by the state can be as low as $15,000; relatively few victims
will settle with the insurer for that amount if they think that taking you to court could net them ten times as much.
Bumping your limit to $250,000 is usually pretty cheap. In fact, if you have collision coverage,
you can more than make up for it by increasing your deductible to $1,000.

As for biking on public roads: it pays to wear a helmet and bright-colored clothing, to stay well clear of the doors of parked
vehicles, move in a straight line instead of weaning in and out of the traffic,
and watch for cars trying to make right turns. It's good to scan for cross traffic at intersections 
and signal all turns. Conversely, it's unwise to run red lights -
the risk is not worth the seconds shaved off your commute. Last but not least, it's a bad idea to ride
without holding the handlebars; it's a cool skill, but when you do that, a single rock or an
unnoticed pothole can throw you right under the wheels of a passing bus or down the ravine.
3.4.3. Safety tip #3: Show respect to dangerous machines and chemicals 
It's best to read up on the safety rules pertaining to your weekend hobbies and to your daytime job; I'd also
ask others about their horror stories and vigorously take notes. One should always be careful around power tools
such as chainsaws, table saws, angle grinders, lathes, and nail guns - they have quite a penchant for taking fingers off and eyes out. (Table
saws in particular are responsible for about 30,000 serious injuries annually, or about 40% of all workshop
accidents.)


In general, it's best not to horse around any heavy machinery; if it's weighs more than you, it can kill you 
in the blink of an eye. This is also important for children: we should teach them
not to play behind or under parked cars. And if you have a toddler, it's good to use straps to secure rickety dressers and
other tall, heavy furniture.

At home, my other advice would be to stay alert around deep fryers and pots of boiling water. It's also
good to wear eye protection when working with
drain cleaners, bleach, and other caustic substances. Lastly, it's useful to learn
about the overdose risks of paracetamol (ibuprofen is a much safer pick) and take a critical look at your prescription
drugs, especially when it comes to opioids. If you're ever doing DIY electrical work, I'd learn how to do it properly,
and get a non-contact voltage probe to double-check for live wires before touching anything.
3.4.4. Safety tip #4: Don't die in a fire 
One of the well-known defenses is to install smoke detectors and keep them operational; if they are going off too often,
it's possible to move them farther away from the kitchen, or switch to photoelectric sensors, which are much less
sensitive to minor cooking mishaps. If running new wiring is a challenge firmly outside your DIY comfort zone,
there are many long-lasting battery-operated units to choose from.

It's also good to get at least two good-sized ABC fire extinguishers (5-10 lbs or so) and keep one in
your bedroom. Similarly, it helps to learn how to  deal with oil fires, to avoid stockpiling excess flammable materials,
and to be very careful when pouring flammable liquids near open flames (this includes alcoholic drinks).
Other tips include watering your Christmas tree and using LED tree lights; or unplugging devices with lithium-polymer batteries
when leaving home. Finally, it's important not to put grills next to siding-clad walls and not to overload extension cords;
and when cooking, it pays to stay in the kitchen or set a timer to remind yourself that the oven is on.
3.4.5. Safety tip #5: Just in case, keep your senses razor-sharp 
If you're regularly drinking or doing psychoactive drugs, try to kick the habit - or at least scale it back.
I'm not going to give you a talk about the evils of cannabis, but by the end of the day,
impaired judgment is impaired judgment. It inherently increases the odds of waltzing into trouble or
getting hurt.
3.5. Prepper commandment #5: Don't become a victim 
In addition to the dangers of poor financial planning and the ever-present specter of
unintentional injury, another threat we should reckon with is becoming a victim of a crime.
Although the risk is not as pervasive as the challenges discussed earlier in this chapter,
it still earns a distinction as one of the things that many readers may have to face at
some point in their lives.

Ask a hardcore prepper for advice on this matter, and they will probably tell you to start practicing hand-to-hand
combat, get a knife, or carry a gun. But in reality, we need a more nuanced and proportional approach to threats,
and one that emphasizes avoidance and de-escalation, rather than the ability to resolve each and every
conflict with a single well-placed shot. Sure, a self-defense weapon can save your butt in some life-or-death
situations, but these are comparatively rare; such a tool won't deter a pickpocketer, won't stop a
burglar from ransacking your place while you are at work, and won't prevent a hacker from emptying your bank
account while you're busy watching the reruns of .

In other words, while this guide certainly doesn't have an anti-self-defense or an anti-firearm
slant, we'll try to take a broader view before delving into the comparative merits of
karate chops, blade weapons, firearms, stun guns, and pepper spray.
3.5.1. Defense tip #1: Practice situational awareness when on foot 
When walking around town, it's useful to keep scanning your surroundings and be mindful of people around you; it can be
dangerous to get lost in thought in transitional spaces, such as pedestrian underpasses, back alleys, or empty parking lots. If your spidey
senses are tingling, I'd just bail: make a sharp turn and sprint away. I wouldn't worry that some random dude
who is closing up on me at night might be perplexed or offended by your move.
It's also important not to freeze up if somebody hollers or authoritatively barks an order at you - complying is a very
powerful instinct, and some assailants know to exploit it. If a stranger in a parking lot has no discernible business with you, there's
limited value in letting them get close.

Of course, some street-savvy readers may consider it to be in poor form to sprint away from a threat, and may be
inclined to confront the danger and see where that takes them. It's an OK choice if you are well-armed or
physically fit, but is certainly not a way to minimize the probability of harm.
3.5.2. Defense tip #2: Make yourself pickpocket-proof 
In shopping malls, on mass transit, and in other crowded settings, I wouldn't carry my most precious
valuables in front or back pockets; a purse is also a clear no-no. Inner pockets of jackets, and chest- or
knee-level pockets of pants and shirts, are much harder to muck with. Discreet, slim waist
packs or under-the-garments neck wallets work even better. If you're fashion-conscious, it may help to
emphasize to your friends that you are wearing such accessories only ironically. It might even start a trend!
3.5.3. Defense tip #3: Protect your valuables at home 
Most break-ins are purely opportunistic: thieves are in and out within five minutes, quickly rummaging
through all the places where people usually keep valuable stuff. You can bank on them going through
every nook and cranny of your bedroom, looking under the mattress, peeking into every drawer -
and grabbing everything that looks shiny and is easy to lift. Their usual targets include phones,
cameras, tablets, laptops, jewelry, firearms, loose cash, checkbooks, credit cards, and prescription
meds. Vital documents that may be useful for identity theft or benefits fraud, such as drivers
licenses, passports, and SSN cards, are also a fair game.

Break-ins are difficult to prevent, especially in suburban single-family homes with secluded backyards and
street-level windows and doors; tall fences and window bars can work, but they are expensive and
tend to draw the ire of your neighbors. The most cost-effective solution may be to keep your windows
and doors closed when away, but beyond that, just optimize for hassle-free
outcomes. You can leave some less important goodies in plain sight - say, some cheap jewelry, a modest
amount of cash, and a beat-up phone - and put all the real valuables in a much less obvious or less
accessible spot.
A heavy safe will usually do; diversion safes fashioned into books, cans or clocks
 are pretty cool, too - if you trust yourself not to accidentally throw them away.

We'll talk about home security equipment later on - but in general, devices such as alarm systems, cameras,
or sophisticated locks play a lesser role in keeping your belongings safe; a well-trained dog can work wonders,
but especially in an urban or a suburban setting, such a pet is a substantial commitment (and can turn out to be
a lazy bum).

If there's another powerful and low-cost
burglary prevention tool at your disposal, it's being careful not to attract targeted theft. Be mindful
of who you invite into your home, who handles your keys, and how much you signal about your financial status to
your more distant family, random acquaintances, or strangers parked across the street. If you have children, it's
probably good to teach them not to brag about what they have at home.

Advertising your wealth aside,
another sure way to invite burglars is to make it seem that your house is unoccupied: packages piling up in front,
an overflowing mailbox, an empty driveway, all lights turned off at night. Asking a neighbor to park a car 
in your driveway, putting some lights on a timer, and having someone pick up your mail,
are just several examples of low-cost solutions that are worth trying out whenever going on a longer trip.
3.5.4. Defense tip #4: Plan for dangerous encounters 
Sometimes, you can't avoid a confrontation. It's good to rehearse potential reactions if somebody asks you to get into a car,
demands cash, or barges into your occupied home. It would be a complete shock for you, but they
have probably done it before - so you gotta practice if you want to have the upper hand. Even if they have a 
weapon trained on you, it's a game of confidence and wits, not just physical force.

For muggings, keeping several $10 or $20 bills in your front pocket (and having real valuables somewhere else)
can be enough to send them on their way; in busy locations, you should also be able to just
ignore the mugger and briskly walk away. For more serious incidents, it may be useful to respond with something
that is non-threatening but catches the assailant off guard. Simply feigning a panic attack or initiating
a startling conversation ("hey, are you a friend of CJ's? Pretty sure we've met last year!")
can throw them off balance - buying you a split second to fight back or get away. Of course, you also need a plan for
that next step; that's where your running skills, your bare-hands self-defense talents, or 
your weapons proficiency can come into play. But again, you need to actively practice and develop approaches
that have a chance of working in real life; there's no verbal diversion strategy in the world that would
give you enough time to fumble through your purse to find an old, gummed up can of pepper spray.

For home intrusions, you should try to act out various scenarios: say, confronting the bad guy or trying
to escape. Take into account that break-ins can happen at different times of day or night. Remember that
intruders may have varied intents, too; some folks may be homicidal or high, but most will just
want your laptop and will be very worried about getting hurt. Many robbers work in pairs, too.

Whether you like it or not, you may eventually have to defend yourself, so be
sure to understand the law. Nobody should take such advice from random people on the Internet, but as far
as I can tell, in much of the US and in many other western countries, you have no duty to run away from an attacker
and can use deadly force if you have a reasonable and immediate reason to fear for your life or the
lives of others. But there are exceptions; for example, despite recent reforms, a duty to retreat outside
one's home exists in several northeastern states and in some corners of the Midwest. There are also
differences in how seemingly similar self-defense statutes get interpreted by the police, by prosecutors,
and by courts in different parts of the world.
3.5.5. Defense tip #5: Don't be an easy target online 
Your cyber-life matters - or at the very least, your bank account password and your credit
card numbers do. To avoid falling prey to hackers, 
keep your software up-to-date, choose decent and unique passwords for all
important websites, don't install sketchy freebies, and don't fall for legit-looking but
unexpected messages, prompts, or phone calls. When in doubt, just leave the site you were on or
hang up the phone, do some web searches to understand what's going on, and maybe try again some time later.
Attackers often try to create a false sense of urgency to get you to make rushed decisions; in reality, whatever
it is that you're asked to do, it can wait.

Be sure to make offline backups of any documents you can't afford to lose, and don't keep anything
too embarassing on your computer; ransomware is a very real threat, and it's best not to put yourself
in a position where you have no choice but to pay the hackers.

Beware of financial scams. If you get an IM from a friend on an
unannounced overseas trip urgently asking for a loan, call them or check in with their family
first. There's probably no inheritance waiting for you in Nigeria, your chatroom bride-to-be in
Ukraine is not short on cash, and you are not the 1,000,000th visitor to . 

Oh, one more thing: don't log into your bank, e-mail, or any other sensitive services from
other people's computers; if you absolutely have to, change your password as soon as you get
home. It's not that your acquitances are evil, but they may be more sloppy than you when it
comes to keeping their devices safe.
3.5.6. Defense tip #6: Don't make enemies 
If we're doing something that's morally reprehensible or socially unwelcome, we're
greatly increasing the odds of getting hurt. It doesn't matter if we think it's perfectly legal:
if we build a reputation as malicious jerks, a bored prosecutor will probably dream up a 
felony charge to hit us with. Or perhaps they won't, but one of the people you wronged will lose it and
take justice into their own hands. In other words, if one wants to escape harm, they shouldn't mess with
others out of malice, jealousy, boredom, or for petty personal gain.
3.6. Prepper commandment #6: Get in shape 
In the United States, about one in three adults is obese - that is, are overweight to the
point where the condition likely interferes with their health or their daily lives. And while many
folks in the prepper community tend to grossly overstate the importance of tip-top physical fitness,
there is no denying that obesity is a very real foe. For example, among low-BMI males around the age of 40,
the incidence of diabetes hovers around 1-4%, but the same number skyrockets to 50-80% for obese guys.
Many other, serious metabolic and cardiovascular diseases follow the same curve - and can make it
very difficult for the affected families to cope even with fairly prosaic and short-lived emergencies.

In all likelihood, if you are obese or slowly getting there, you know quite well that losing some weight is not really the hard part:
if you were to stop eating for a week, you would likely shed 5-10 pounds. But it would
be a miserable experience, and one almost guaranteed to be followed by an even faster rebound. So, the real
challenge of weight management is coming up with a long-term strategy that does not amount to torture -
and does not leave us constantly craving for familiar foods.

Alas, most of the popular diets make this task awfully hard: they force their followers to abandon a
lifetime of dietary habits, taste preferences, and eating schedules - and stuff themselves full of kale, turnips,
quinoa, acai berry, or whatever else happens to be this week's "fat-fighting superfood". To add insult to injury,
most of the nutrition fads are not actually backed by real, reproducible science; suffice to say that in the 70s, 
table sugar
was widely touted as a dieting aid. Even today, weight loss advice tends to revolve around robustly debunked
concepts - say, the existence negative calorie foods, the alleged superiority of low-carb but high-fat diets, the evils of
HFCS and aspartame, or the significance of eating meals on a particular schedule thoroughout the day.

Just as importantly, our innate nutritional instincts can be badly misguided, too: for example,
contrary to common wisdom, bananas are not really healthier than potatoes, and the bulk nutritional qualities
of a glass of apple juice are pretty close to those of a can of Sprite. Heck, good ol' butter has fewer calories than
olive or coconut oil, so a "healthy" bruschetta is not far off from a less-reputable southern delicacy:
deep-fried butter on a stick. It gets better: a supposedly nutritious
burrito from Chipotle easily packs four times as many calories as a greasy burger from McDonald's, while a
loaded coffee at Starbucks is about the same as downing two hot dogs with a heaping
side of mashed potatoes to boot. The end result is a
truly abysmal track record for most weight loss regimes; the long-term success rate for people who try to slim down
is estimated to be somewhere between 5 and 20%.

My advice is that if you want to lose weight, it's best to stay away from celebrity-endorsed diets,
dubious nutrition claims, and rigid, unworkable plans that seek to control your every urge. While every
situation is different, here are several ways to eat less while still staying happy:

Start your breakfast with
high-quality protein powder and 
insoluble dietary fibers (about 20-30 grams each; you can mix them together in a cup of cold water). There is reasonable
that fiber and protein can increase satiety and reduce cravings thoroughout the day. It's not "natural",
but it beats making implausible resolutions to organize your life around low-calorie, fiber-rich meals - especially
if you don't like veggies or don't usually cook your food.

Beyond this, stick to your favorite foods and don't feel pressured to skip regular meals - but cut 
portions in half, even if it means throwing a half-eaten burger out. Don't go back for seconds, too.
It will feel wrong the first couple of times, but it's surprisingly easy to do. That's because portion control
is almost completely psychological; your blood hormone and nutrient levels go up only some time after you cleaned your
plate. Eating more slowly can make this step a lot easier, too.

For habitual snacking in front of a computer or a TV, see if you can substantially reduce calories while still
sticking to satiating and tasty treats. This can be easier than it sounds: say, helping yourself to a nice
serving of salted popcorn (110 kcal), preparing a cup of
buttery mashed potatoes (110 kcal), grabbing some
quick oatmeal (130 kcal), 
or sipping some hot instant chicken soup
 (50-80 kcal), is an excellent alternative to Cheetos, M&Ms, or even supposedly healthy peanuts
(easily 400-600 kcal). If you enjoy pickles or raw sauerkraut, they are extremely low-calorie, so have as
much as you want; in the same vein, carrots are a pretty guilt-free choice. Chewing gum can keep you occupied
between meals, and if you are downing multiple cans of sugary drinks a day, artificially-sweetened sodas offer a
good alternative (despite some ongoing controversy).

When buying food, don't fall for "diet", "reduced fat", "low sugar", or "low carbs" ice cream, yogurts, cakes, pizza,
pasta, and so on - the differences are so minor that you might as well have the real thing and stop
fooling yourself. Watch out for deceptive portion sizes, too. For example, Cheetos are labeled as 150 kcal
per "serving", but there are almost 10 servings in a regular bag! Frozen fries are another great example:
they look pretty low-cal until you realize that a serving is just 10-15 pieces or so - certainly not enough
to make you feel full.

While dieting, try to drink a bit more and start taking
OTC multivitamin supplements; they don't offer
clear-cut benefits under normal circumstances, but they can compensate for mineral and vitamin
deficiencies if you never had a particularly thoughtful diet, and are about to start eating less than you
were accustomed to.

Probably don't hit the gym. Hold off with intense workouts at least until you are close to your target weight.
Daily exercise schedules are hard to keep for more than a couple weeks, especially if you lead a busy
life; on top of that, a drastic increase in physical activity can trigger cravings or upend your
nutritional needs. If you are itching to burn some extra fat, incorporate less punishing activities
into your daily routine - say, walking or leisurely biking to work.
Be in this for the long haul. Effortlessly losing 1-2 lbs per week while slowly developing better
habits is far more meaningful than starving yourself for a month to get immediate but short-lived
results. Get an accurate bathroom scale, take daily measurements first thing in the morning,
calculate key milestones, and put it all in a spreadsheet to keep yourself honest and motivated.
It will probably take 6-9 months to get the outcome you want; daily or weekly weight
fluctuations are almost completely meaningless, but you should be seeing
a consistent and predictable biweekly drop.

I can't promise that this approach will work for everyone, but after trying countless other methods,
this is roughly the formula that worked for me.

Of course, if you are very obese or have any serious health conditions, such as diabetes or CVD, talk
to a doctor first. In such situations, aggressive dieting can carry additional risks and calls for
some monitoring along the way; a routine blood test or an ECG shouldn't cost much. And it goes without
saying that if your diet makes you feel listless or sick, it's definitely time to stop right away!

Now, when it comes to fitness per se,
I firmly believe that there is no need to go overboard; good health is far more important
than Rambo skills. While getting buff may be a fun pastime for some young folks, there are
very few emergencies that would force you to run 30 miles or climb a 20 foot wall. Being able to
walk or bike for several hours is likely good enough to deal with all practical scenarios we talked
about thus far.
3.7. Prepper commandment #7: Make friends with neighbors 
The thing about disasters is that they seldom unfold precisely as planned. Perhaps you will lose a job
and get robbed the same week. Perhaps in the middle of a prolonged outage, you will find out that some of
your emergency supplies have been misplaced, damaged, or spoiled. Maybe your plan to walk a mile to get
drinking water from a river will get foiled by a broken limb. And maybe a well thought-out home defense
strategy will prove worthless when standing eye to eye with an angry mob of rioters armed with rocks.

In trying times, people always come together and find strength in local communities. Even if you
don't expect it, you will almost certainly be able to count on the kindness of strangers. But your
odds can be greatly improved by getting to know your neighbors ahead of time, by cultivating
trust and mutual respect, and by getting a sense of each others' toolkits and skills. In a grim
situation, being on good terms with a doctor or a veterinarian can quite literally save your life.
And heck, some rural communities in the US even maintain communal stashes of emergency supplies!

Of course, it goes both ways: one will almost certainly find it harder to get help if their neighbors still resent
them for puking on their doormat and constantly partying at night; so once again, not being a
jerk to other people is not just good manners, but a very legitimate survival skill. Even if it's not
really our nature, it pays to say "hi", engage in small talk, and offer to help with minor hurdles every now and
then. It's good to bring your neighbors a pie or some donuts, add them on Facebook, and try to find common interests.
Socialize with coworkers who live nearby, too. Even if the zombie apocalypse never comes, it
probably won't be a waste of your time.

Now, many "true" preppers advise newcomers to keep mum about your plans, so that in an emergency, you don't have
to fend off armies of freeloaders begging for a slice of your meager supplies - or worse yet, trying to take them by
force. I think that this attitude is short-sighted; sure, it makes sense not to broadcast your plans
to the entire world, and there is no conceivable benefit to posting Facebook selfies with your stash
of freeze-dried food or with a pile of cash. But the clear value of convincing some of your friends to
start prepping greatly outweighs the distant possibility
that one of them will attempt to raid your home the moment the power goes out.
3.8. Prepper commandment #8: Write down a response plan 
To cope with a true emergency, it's not enough to know the risks and sit on a pile of
survival gear: we need to plan ahead. If your house is on fire, there may be no time to rifle through
folders to gather all your vital documents; if the floodwaters are rising or a chemical tanker overturns
on a nearby highway, it may be too late to start thinking about refueling your car. And if you're
stranded on a rural road in a broken-down vehicle, you may sorely regret not putting any drinking
water in the trunk.

In fact, even in situations that don't unfold in such a dramatic way, sketching out a plan can help you
optimize spending and spot potential problems early on. For example, there may be little merit to stockpiling
50 lbs of rice if you can't possibly store enough water to cook it all. But then, a quick look at the map
may reveal that there is a freshwater reservoir within a
biking distance of your home. Great - maybe all you need is a bike basket and 
a pair of spare inner tubes.

So, here's a bit of homework: make a list of all the threats discussed in this guide that seem to apply to you, 
alongside any other contingencies you worry about. For each and every one of them, draft a detailed, step-by-step
preparedness and response plan that sounds right given your life situation.
Don't obsess over getting all the details right;
we'll try to refine your choices in section 4, and even then, it may take several iterations to
settle on an approach you are really happy with. For now, simply list all the noteworthy dangers,
jot down some initial answers to the following questions, and see where that takes you.
3.8.1. Threat assessment topic #1: Is it a priority? 
Do some research to make sure you are not wasting your time on implausible risks. How likely is it that you
would have to face this particular danger, and how much damage can it conceivably cause? For example, do
you live in a 100-year flood zone? In the path of tropical storms? In a high-crime neighborhood?
Be sure to search around and study publicly available resources; reaching out to local emergency response
organizations can be a good plan, too. Try to focus on reputable sources. The science in doomsday movies and
on conspiracy websites seldom checks out.

(If you decide that you don't care about a particular risk, skip the remaining questions and just move on to
the next problem on your list.)
3.8.2. Threat assessment topic #2: What do you need to be prepared? 
Do you need to secure any supplies or make other arrangements to prepare for this scenario? If you
need to stockpile items, do you have enough room?
How long would these supplies last in an emergency, and how often would you need to replace them in
storage? Are there any additional steps that you want to take to be in a better place a month,
a year, or five years from now? Make a detailed list and tally the costs.

Be critical of any assumptions you are making in your plan: sure, we've seen our share of disaster
movies, but it pays to search for statistics or historical accounts of how such emergencies actually unfold
in real life. Don't assume that all contingencies are covered by a generic home insurance policy: for
example, earthquake and flood coverage is often sold separately (and costs a lot); and in any case, even
if the insurance eventually pays, you still need a short-term survival strategy to deal with the loss.

When it comes to dangers such as break-ins, fires, or earthquakes, be sure to walk around the house and
take note of anything that unnecessarily exacerbates the risk. Perhaps throwing out old junk,
reorganizing the contents of kitchen cabinets, adding earthquake latches,
or fixing a broken lock would be a better use of your time than ordering space-age
prepper gadgets from Amazon.

For natural disasters common in your region, you can find a lot of relevant (if US-specific) advice on the
webpages of CDC,
FEMA, and the
American Red Cross. You can also have a look at the excellent,
detailed hazard maps available from FEMA, USGS, NOAA, and several other agencies.
3.8.3. Threat assessment topic #3: How and when do you need to act? 
Think about the exact, step-by-step playbook you would follow: what actions would you need to take and how
much time would you have to carry out the plan? Will you be sheltering at home, or is this a situation
where you need to evacuate? If the answer is "it depends", what would be the key factors,
and how quickly would you need to make the final call? If you pick the wrong option, how bad would
it be?

Be prepared to make these decisions based on imperfect information. For example, pandemic scares happen
every couple of years - Ebola, Zika, West Nile, avian flu, swine flu, SARS, MERS, and so on - and most of them
fizzle out. In the moment, you don't know if you're dealing with the real thing; it follows that your plan
needs to take into account the ambiguity of the situation, enable you to make sound decisions early on,
and manage the fallout gracefully if you make the wrong call.

There is a certain mystique surrounding survivalism, but bugging out is seldom the answer. Leaving your
home and venturing into the unknown puts you at a tremendous disadvantage, so it's almost always better to
dig in; but if you have to leave, also ask yourself this:
 Crashing with a friend or a family member is vastly preferable to
  camping in the woods. Either way, is the location sufficiently far away to be unaffected by the
  event you're running away from? If you are driving, will you have enough gas to get there?
  (Again, would it help to have a habit of keeping the tank at least half full?) Are the roads
  likely to be congested or blocked? How many people will think of exactly the same location?
  What  are the alternatives if the destination proves to be inaccessible, overcrowded, or unsafe?
...what do I need to bring? How much can you realistically take with you
  when leaving by car, by bike, or on foot? What are the most important items, and will
  you be able to grab them quickly enough? To simplify things, would it make sense to maintain a
  small cache of supplies in the trunk of your car or at a friend's place - and if yes, what
  should be in that box?
3.8.4. Threat assessment topic #4: What if you are somewhere unexpected? 
If you have a daytime job or go to school, there is a good chance that the event you are
preparing for could unfold while you are at that location - or somewhere on the way. Do you need a
special plan to handle this possibility? Can you get back home easily? Do you need water,
food, money, or clothes to make that trip? How likely is it that you would be hurt
or stranded somewhere?

Separately from this, consider the risks of less frequent but more dangerous trips.
If you're sightseeing or taking a business trip to
a particularly inhospitable or remote destination, what do you
need to survive if, say, you get lost or your car breaks down?
3.8.5. Threat assessment topic #5: Do you need to talk to your family? 
If you have a spouse, walk them through your plans and make sure they can access the
essential supplies and know how to use them in your absence. If you have children, give them the
very basics as well. For example, in case of a fire, they should know the safest way out
without having to wait for you, and they need to know you won't be upset if they kick out or cut
a window screen; tell them how to react to home intrusions and medical emergencies, too.

If you are separated from others and need to meet someplace other than home,
make sure that everybody will remember where the meeting point is - and will know
what to do if you can't make it on time. Keeping some instructions in a wallet can go
a long way.
3.8.6. Threat assessment topic #6: How can your plans backfire or fail? 
Try to identify the aspects of your plan that are most likely to go wrong, and come up with
viable alternatives. Take a hard look at any new problems you are creating, too:
for example, if you want to store gas in your garage, it will probably help in an evacuation,
but will also increase the odds of accidentally starting a serious fire. Or, consider a 
far more prosaic case: if
you are planning to stockpile batteries or bottles of insect repellent, you should make sure
they can't leak and spoil other, more vital supplies nearby.
3.9. Prepper commandment #9: Plans have flaws, so also write a will 
People die, sometimes unexpectedly and in silly, undignified ways. Dying is seldom a
pleasant affair and you generally don't get to choose the "how" or "when", but you can make
sure that the people who depend on you are going to have the means to get by.

If you have children, a stay-at-home spouse, or any other people who may be dependent
on you, it makes sense to write a will. Even if you don't have much of an estate to
dispose of, your will can provide instructions for the custody of minor kids,
potentially shielding them from abusive relatives or from foster care. This can be
particularly important for expats, whose closest surviving family members
may be in another country, difficult for the court to pinpoint or communicate with.

In most jurisdictions, to draft a will, you don't need a lawyer; the only skill that
comes handy is the ability to express yourself clearly and unambiguously. There are
countless state- and country-specific templates available online; in many cases, to
carry legal weight, the will just needs to be co-signed by disinterested parties acting
as witnesses - or cheaply notarized.

Where possible, you should name an executor in the will - a trusted person who will follow
your instructions and take care of the formalities. If you don't, one will be
probably appointed by the court. This will be costly and may lead to disappointing outcomes.

When writing this document, describe your "ideal" scenario, but also think about all the
complications that may crop up and derail your plan. For example, what if both you and your
spouse die, but your children survive? Or, who should get what share of the money if
your spouse is badly hurt and can't resume caring for the kids, so they end up in the
custody of a relative? What if your designated executor or custodian is unable or unwilling
to perform the duties? And in an extreme case, if there are no surviving relatives,
do you have any favorite charity?

Of course, for the will to be executed, it needs to be found. It makes sense to keep one
copy in an intuitive location in your home, because that's where people will be looking for it
first; but if there's a fire or a flood, that copy may be lost. So, make another witnessed or
notarized copy and give it to the executor or to a close family member who doesn't live with you.
Some folks don't recommend creating multiple legally binding copies of the same will, since it
may cause some confusion, but from a disaster preparedness perspective, it's a smart call.

In many states, even with an uncontested will, it may take many months for the probate process
to be wrapped up. If you are the sole provider for your family, make sure that they
will have the means to survive in the meantime. The right kind of a shared bank account ("joint
tenancy with right of survivorship") can do the trick; "transfer on death" directives can also
work, and although the process is slightly more involved, it may result in a more favorable
tax treatment. There are several other approaches to this problem, too, but they tend to be
more dicey from the legal perspective - or more costly and more time-consuming to set up.

Yes! That's the part where he stops blabbing about personal finance and wills, and we all get to
shop for nunchucks and throwing knives!

...Gotcha! But yup, let's talk about the supplies and tools that may enable you to prepare for
common emergencies in a cost-effective way.

Even with adequate shelter and with limited physical activity, losing access to water means certain
death after a couple of truly rotten days. Thankfully, in the developed
world, this is a very uncommon fate: emergencies that leave communities without potable water are not rare,
but when they happen, the government practically trips over itself to immediately restore service
or to get water trucks on the road. 

At the same time, it's not entirely wrong to worry that in some circumstances, the response may
not come quickly enough; heck, the Department of Homeland Security says that for the
first 72 hours after a disaster,
you may be on your own
and should have enough supplies to survive. The odds of ending up in a real pickle may be modest,
but the stakes are extremely high - and compared to the complexity of preparing to some
other contingencies, the cost of stockpiling some drinking water is practically nil. If nothing
else, when a calamity strikes, you would have one less thing to worry about.

An argument can be made that even in an emergency, potable water is never too far away; after all,
most human settlements have been erected near natural reservoirs: rivers, lakes, or easily
reached underground aquifers. But this is an oversimplification. In
rural areas, water supply can be fairly meager and vulnerable to weather fluctuations and
other cyclic phenomena. For cities, it is true that many of them are seated on the banks of major
lakes or rivers, but suburban sprawl can easily put some residents 10-20 miles away from the
nearest reservoir; on top of that, some of the 20th century settlements in semi-arid and
desert climates rely on water hauled from tens or hundreds of miles away.

Heck, even if you do have a nearby water source, it may take surprisingly little to spoil it: for example,
after an unusually powerful storm, floodwaters can carry toxic sewage from treatment plants and into
rivers and lakes. All in all, stockpiling some amount of drinking water is just a smart,
low-effort prepper strategy, especially in areas with an elevated likelihood of large-scale
natural disasters or industrial accidents.

This brings us to the "how" - and more importantly, "how much". The average person in the US consumes
somewhere between 50 and 100 gallons a day. A lot of this goes toward uses such as
long showers, laundry, dishwashing, and flushing the toilet - but even if we take out some of the
less essential uses, the minimum consumption that allows us to continue many of the key
household activities is probably in excess of 10-20 gallons a day.
On the other end of the spectrum, the absolute minimum water intake, as estimated by the US military,
is somewhere around one quart per person per day; but note that this assumes no weather extremes, no
substantial exertion, and no immediate hygiene needs.

In the short haul, when all you really need is to stay hydrated, storing about 1.5
to 2 gallons per household member - enough for perhaps up to a week of very judicious use
- should provide a viable if modest buffer for emergencies. Store-bought gallon jugs
are pretty cheap, and easy to squeeze in just about anywhere; if you keep them away from sunlight
and heat, they should last 5+ years before needing to be rotated or thrown out. The main problem
is that they tend to leak, so if you're unlucky, they may ruin cabinets or wooden floors; if this is a 
concern, HDPE gallon jugs or thoroughly rinsed 2 liter soda bottles may be a better bet.

Of course, that's the bare minimum - but if you have a garage, a basement, or other unused storage
space, I would actually recommend going a bit further and grabbing one or two
5 gallon cans per every household member. Although multi-week water outages are very unlikely,
this simply gives you a more comfortable safety margin: if something goes awfully wrong and
it becomes clear that help is not coming any time soon, you will still have time to look for
alternatives or evacuate. A reserve also puts you in a better situation if it's unusually
hot or if you have any urgent hygiene needs. The cans are very easy to use: wash them with a 
small amount of regular, non-scented laundry bleach, rinse, and fill up with tap water.
Rotate the contents every 2-4 years or so.

If you want to prepare for longer-term disasters, or if you have a large family,
you can make realistic plans only if you live in a single-family home. This
decision alone may give you access to 50-100 gallons of water sitting in the water heater
(unless it's a tankless design). Next, if you have some backyard or garage space, you may opt for
relatively inexpensive 55 gallon plastic barrels, taking up about as much space a small curbside trash can. Another 
common option, costing about the same per gallon stored, is a 275 gallon IBC tote. Such solutions can easily
provide water for an entire family for up to several months, with some
allowance for laundry and hygiene needs. Some preppers stockpile even more - but really, if you
waited this long and the conditions are still dire, it may be high time to hit the road and find
some other place to live.

While home storage of water is not hugely complicated, things get a bit dicey when you have
to evacuate - or if you end up being stranded away from home. If you have a car, your best
bet is to put together a small emergency supplies box that, among other essentials, houses
one or two 1-gallon jugs of water - and keep it in your trunk at all times. But without a
car, your prospects are less cheerful: in case of a widespread disaster, your range will be
severely limited, and even if you take some modest amount of water with you, you will need to
reach a more hospitable location within 1-2 days. A bicycle, a plan, and a good map
will help. A
folding cart or an inconspicuous box of supplies kept at work may be viable choices, too.

As for drinking untreated water: contrary to popular beliefs, in temperate climates, you are
generally not taking huge risks by drinking from a backcountry lake or a creek; if it looks
and smells all right, it's quite likely fine. On the flip side, a bout of diarrhea due to giardiasis
is probably the last thing you want to experience in such a situation, so it's good to take precautions
if you can. Boiling your drinking water is a very robust method of eradicating microscopic
wildlife (more about that soon). When boiling is not an option, adding several drops of regular,
old-fashioned 
laundry bleach per gallon of water, then letting it sit for 30-60 minutes, will have a roughly
comparable effect. Note that bleach has a limited shelf life; you will need to rotate it every
1-2 years or so. When on the
go, sodium dichloroisocyanurate pills (AquaTabs)
can be more convenient than liquid bleach and work just as well.

There are several other water purification techniques, including iodine, various types
of filters, or even very expensive desalination systems.
The recent Flint water crisis
highlights the value of permanently installed and well-maintained RO units. But for 
short-term survival, my take is that most of the filtration systems targeted at preppers
increase costs without offering clear-cut benefits. And really, don't overthink it: if the choice is between dehydration
and drinking straight from a scummy pond, drink from the pond.

You can survive several weeks without food, but you won't be having a very good time. Food is
costly, its supply is fairly easily disrupted, and it's a resource that the government may be
much less inclined to deliver to your doorstep when things go wrong. So, with a variety of
reasonable scenarios to worry about - anything from natural disasters to economic downturns - it
just makes sense to be able to feed yourself even if you can't buy groceries for a while.

Of course, everybody has some non-perishable food around the house, but it's much better to create a
dedicated stash: this way, you can count on the supplies always being at hand, and you can stockpile
something more nutritious than stale crackers, a suspect bottle of olive oil, and a rusty can of tomato
sauce. With a well thought-out stockpile of ready-made food, it's also a lot easier to hit the road.

For short-term survival, the highest priority is just energy - preferably in a form that doesn't
cost much, lasts forever, requires no preparation, and takes up little space. Generally,
you're looking at high-sugar or high-fat foods. Some of the common zero-preparation options include:
 
Grocery store brands may have limited shelf life, but several prepper-targeted,
Mylar-packed varieties can last
5-10 years. Such products are inexpensive (~300 kcal per dollar), convenient, and energy-dense
(~2,000 kcal per pound). On the flip side, they are probably pretty nauseating as your primary
food. Imagine living solely off Jelly Bellies for a week.

Sold under several brands, including
Datrex, ER Bar, S.O.S., Grizzly,
and more. Biscuit-like, less sugary and with a more agreeable taste than energy bars -
somewhat reminiscent of shortbread. In my book, S.O.S. and Datrex taste best.
Very inexpensive (~550 kcal per dollar) and should last 5-10 years when stored in a
cool place. A tolerable choice for short- 
to medium-term nutrition in an emergency. Easy to pack, giving you ~2,200 kcal
per pound.
Canned meat, veggies, or fruit.
Storage life in excess of 20 years (regardless of "best by" dates).
Tasty, relatively cheap (~200-300 kcal per dollar), and the choice is pretty broad.
Fruits, veggies, and soups are not very energy-dense (~200 kcal per pound), making them
impractical for hiking or bugging out; on the flip side, the syrup may provide some additional
hydration. Meats fare much better, tipping the scales at around 1,500 kcal per pound.
Canned foods are a good option for longer-term planning, provided that you have enough
shelf space.

Popular with hikers. Extremely lightweight (up to 2,500 kcal per pound) and surprisingly
tasty. The most reputable brand is
Mountain House.
Fairly expensive on a calorie basis (100-150 kcal per $1), but you get a choice of
raspberry crumble, chicken with dumplings, bacon and eggs, and everything in between.
Storage life in excess of 15 years. The drawback is that they need some boiling water to
reconstitute (cold water will also work, but not make a tasty meal).

I don't find them particularly tasty, but they are popular among preppers. 
A bit on the heavy side (usually around 1,100 kcal per pound).
Portable warm food with a ton of different menus available - although for the best price,
you usually need to buy a variety box and can't cherry-pick. Moderately expensive 
(~150 kcal per dollar). Shelf life around 5-7 years, depending on the manufacturer and on storage
conditions.

At ~3,000 kcal per pound, nuts are surprisingly energy-dense for something that can be eaten as-is.
Relatively cheap (~400 kcal per dollar). The major drawback is a relatively short shelf life,
probably not exceeding a year or two. Nuts also do not provide complete nutrition, but that's only
a concern in the long haul.

Extremely cheap and energy-dense (2,500 kcal per dollar, 4,100 per pound), making it a unique choice
when space or money is in critically short supply. In contrast to other common fats,
store-brought cans of vegetable shortening (Crisco or the like) should stay
fine for 4 years or more. The product is very bland, but it's perfectly palatable when spread on crackers, mixed
with bacon bits, and so forth. It does not provide complete nutrition - but again, that won't harm you in the
short haul.

For folks who want to focus on the most plausible risks, I suggest stockpiling dry survival rations
to last around 2-3 weeks; seven 3,600 kcal packets per person should do the trick.
That may sound like a lot, but keep in mind that it may take a while for stores to reopen after an earthquake or a
flood - so it's not a bad plan to play it safe. And while eating ration bars for a week sounds bland, you may
be in no mood for home cooking when you have to fix a collapsed roof and the utilities are cut off.

For those who are worried about less likely, longer-term contingencies - or who want to limit their future
grocery expenses in case of a financial shortfall - a more varied stockpile to cover 3-4 months is a reasonable
choice. At that timescale, it's still smart to begin with some number of hassle-free survival rations, but it is
important to complement them with a more palatable menu: freeze-dried or canned meals, MREs, or cheap home-made food.
Crisco aside, some of the nutritious and easily stored staples include Mylar-bagged,
oxygen-scavenged white rice, white flour, dried beans and grains, instant mashed potatoes and oatmeal, pasta, sugar, honey,
powdered milk, salt, spices, and so forth; when stored properly, all of them can last 5 years or more. 
Freeze-dried or garden-grown fruit and veggies can add some flavor to your post-disaster cooking, too. Heck, you
can even buy pretty tasty butter,
chicken breast,
canned bacon,
and bread-like Pilot crackers
with 10+ year shelf life (although they are not cheap).

As for the appropriate calorie intake: almost all adults can function normally on 1,500 calories a
day for extended periods of time, although they will slowly lose weight (probably not more than
half a pound a week). If you are skinny or if you're aiming for surviving many months with no access to other
food, budgeting 2,000-2,200 kcal per day is a safer bet. Since you would have to exercise portion control,
it pays to focus on satiating foods: high-fiber, high-protein, or high-fat.

For hardcore preppers convinced that they may be left with no access to food for a very long time,
it would be also important to maintain a robust intake of protein; somewhere around 40-50 g per
day is believed to be optimal, although you certainly don't need to observe it religiously.

Ready-made protein-rich foods include some energy bars, most dry ration packets, some
freeze-dried dinners, canned meat, and military MREs; smaller amounts
can be found in some veggies, too. You can also stockpile
protein powder -it's bland but relatively
cheap ($1 per day). 
Freeze-dried scrambled eggs, powdered milk,
and related products, including long shelf life
canned or powdered cheeses and pancake mixes, work
well, too. As mentioned earlier, protein and dietary fiber also have a well-established satiating
effect, helping you maintain a balanced diet - which can otherwise be tricky when snacking on
high-calorie foods. Oh: having some OTC multivitamins may be a good plan, especially
to supplement vitamin C.

Of course, some dedicated preppers worry about even more exotic, post-apocalyptic scenarios
mentioned in section 2.3, basically aiming for indefinite self-sufficiency. I don't think it's
a particularly sound concern, but if the prospect of
a civilizational collapse keeps you up at night, I think the options are limited, short of moving
to a rural community
where you could farm, fish, or hunt. Some urban survivalists fantasize about trapping local
squirrels, pigeons, or raccoons - but they would run out of food very fast. Small urban and
suburban gardens are usually difficult to maintain and don't produce enough to feed a family,
too.
4.3. Fuel and electricity 
It takes just a single downed power line to knock out your furnace, AC unit, cooktop, refrigerator,
and to make the lights go out; and when such an outage happens due to a larger-scale natural
disaster, repairs can easily take days or even weeks. We think of fuel as a more dependable resource, but
if 1979 is any guide, you only need  one
well-timed revolution in the Middle East to make it nearly impossible to fill up a car in some
parts of the United States. Of course, such events are usually inconvenient, not disastrous, so it's
perfectly fine not to dwell on them in your plans. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to take a closer
look at what's at stake - and what the potential solutions may be.

Of all the plausible scenarios, another major oil crisis would probably hit most car-owning families
the hardest, limiting their ability to get food or to take care of other, everyday needs. Generally
speaking, there is no simple fix: keeping a gallon or two in your garage won't make much of a
difference, while maintaining significant reserves of gas for personal use can be done safely (and
legally) only if you own a large, rural plot of land. Electric vehicles,
especially if charged from rooftop solar panels, can offer a wonderful backup in some parts of
the world, but they carry a very hefty price tag. The best workaround may be the least inspired
one: if you own a car, you can always keep your tank at least half full (a familiar mantra by now),
and have enough food and other essentials to be able to wait out the worst.

A service interruption or a fuel crisis that takes your cooktop out of service for a week or two
is the other hardship perhaps worth worrying about. It's not just about eating well: in an
emergency, the ability to boil water is one of the best methods of making it safe to drink. While
the owners of rural homes with 500 gallon propane tanks may have little to worry about, the rest of
us would not be having fun. For those who cook using municipal natural gas, a simple backup is a
small countertop electric burner. Conversely, for people with electric ranges, a portable 
camping stove and a handful of dirt-cheap
1 lb propane tanks can be a safe, no-hassle choice. A
pound of propane can boil around 12 gallons of water; the entire setup is also very easy to put in a
backpack if you ever need to leave - so it's basically worth getting either way.

No heating in the middle of a particularly nasty winter can be problematic, too - although it's mostly a
matter of comfort, not survival. In most places, with robust shelter and adequate clothing, bedding, and food, it's
fairly hard to freeze to death at home (but note that the cold may make some infections or medical
conditions worse; you may have to worry about frozen water pipes, too). The situation can become a lot more dire if you are on
foot in the middle of nowhere, so truly hardcore, wilderness-minded preppers may have something to ponder about; but
hauling a sufficient amount of fuel is typically impractical to begin with, so their best bet would be warm clothing,
improvised shelter, and the ability to build a fire. We'll talk about that in the section that
deals with camping supplies.

In some parts of the world, extreme heat can be far more dangerous than cold. When AC is not an option,
it's usually possible to avoid trouble by staying in the shade, drinking a lot, and limiting
physical activity. If it gets really nasty, the best way to cool yourself is to wet your clothing
and hair, then stand in front of a running fan. You have a bigger problem if you happen to be
stranded in a broken down car somewhere in the middle of a desert - but carrying some water
and several other supplies in your trunk should help a great deal. More about that soon.

During a prolonged blackout, keeping flashlights, radios, and cell phones running can become a 
challenge of its own. The most cost-effective approach is to stick to devices that can take
regular AA, AAA, or PP3 (9V) batteries; modern alkaline cells have very long shelf lives (10 years),
can be  bought cheaply in bulk, and will do the
trick for almost all portable electronics you can think of. Of course,
modern power-hungry smartphones are a notable exception to this rule. For that, you can always try 
solar chargers - they work
well, but are a bit fragile and may not perform too amazingly in wooded areas or on overcast
days. You can also go for
hand-crank generators (fragile and labor-intensive)
or AA power banks (mixed reviews). But
ultimately, also allow for the possibility of not being able to call others for a while.

For powering more serious electrical equipment, a generator is a popular choice for people living 
in the backwoods. That said, this option comes with an interesting trade-off: if you were ever
to face a contingency that may last for a longer while, it may be more important to conserve
fuel for driving, cooking, or heating, than to use it for keeping the lights on. A fully-fledged
solar installation helps you
avoid such dilemmas, but costs an arm and a leg. A possible compromise is a jury-rigged
solar setup done at a smaller scale:
if you hook up a 100W panel to a
deep-cycle lead-acid battery
and a low-cost inverter, you gain the ability to
recharge laptops and phones, or even power several desk lamps, a decent-size fan,
or a small refrigerator. The whole contraption costs around $250 and is easy to stow away if
you're not very short on space.

That's probably about it... well, all right: this section focused chiefly
on the immediate consequences of an outage, but a severe fuel crisis or a long-lasting power grid
failure would have profound, cascading effects on the entire economy - probably including out-of-control
unemployment, high inflation, product shortages, and more. That said, these are the outcomes we can already
prepare for by other means. As for extreme
preppers who aspire to long-term energy self-sufficiency, I think it's going to be a
difficult feat: even with a solar installation, under constant cycling, the batteries may not last
much longer than 5 years. Short of finding a cheap Soviet 
RTG
on eBay, they may simply have to adapt to living without electricity or gas.

Although this may sound very disappointing to a typical geek,
the list of genuinely useful prepper electronics is pretty short. Here's what I can honestly recommend:


Computer hardware failures are far more common than space zombies or mutant superbugs. 
Because of this, one of your best investments can be a 
decent pen drive with
a copy of all your important files; in case of bank mix-ups, throw in copies of
recent account statements, too. And hey, if want to feel like
a cyber-ninja - you can always grab a
copy of
Wikipedia. It will undoubtedly come handy for rebuilding the civilization, and it's just 12 GB.
Flashlights or headlamps.

Unless you are living in a rural area, you probably don't need an eye-searing torch that 
chews through ten boxes of batteries in a day. It's better to get several small, high-quality AA flashlights or headlamps
that give you at least 20 hours on low power; I'd keep one near your bed, and another
in your car or in an emergency stash.


Not essential, but 
useful for preparing food, dining, reading, and other fun blackout activities where a narrow beam
would be less comfortable than omnidirectional light.

An old-fashioned radio receiver.

A battery-operated AM/FM radio will be a good way to stay in the loop if cell
networks and the Internet are down, and the civilization is temporarily banished
back to the dark ages (aka the 90s). A cheap, brand-name model, such as
Sony ICFP26, will do just fine.

Handheld FRS/GMRS radios.

Many preppers obsess about long-distance communications, but in a typical emergency, chatting
with people 100 miles away is not a priority. In contrast, a hand-held two-way radio
can be very useful for keeping in touch with your friends and family during any prolonged
outage. Whenever possible, pick
a device that accepts the kind of batteries you can stockpile cheaply. Expect a range
of 2-3 miles in rural regions, a mile or so in the suburbs, and maybe 2-4 blocks
in high-rise environments - no matter what the manufacturer claims.

Ham radio is a longer-distance option, but generally requires a license; if you are interested
in amateur radio, getting a Technician class license in the United States is 
fairly straightforward and costs around $15, but
requires you to spend 8-10 hours memorizing answers to questions - some useful, some not. With all
that said and done, ham radio can help you coordinate local response to more substantial emergencies,
together with local volunteer members of organizations such as ARES or RACES. For personal
communications, handheld 2m radios tend to have a slightly better range than GMRS, but the real perk is being
able to buy a stationary or car-mounted transceiver, or to use a repeater, for considerably greater reach
- from 20 to 200 miles, sometimes more.
(I have some in-depth notes about handheld radios 
here.)A thermometer that won't run out of juice.

Responding to serious emergencies can be stressful and physically taxing, making it easy to catch
nasty infections along the way. To know how bad things have gotten, it's good to have a reliable way to
take body temperature; keep in mind that many low-cost axillary thermometers use LR41
batteries, and that you probably don't have any spares lying around. A traditional glass
thermometer will also work, but is more fragile.
A small space heater and a fan.

Sometimes useful for coping with temperature extremes. Decide for yourself if you
need it. If yes, pretty much any make and model will do.

A dashcam or a security camera for your home. We'll talk about these later on.


Except for flashlights, don't keep any batteries in your emergency electronics, as to minimize the danger of an electrolyte leak messing up the device.

Of course, there are many other high-tech gadgets popular among some of the more affluent 
and paranoid preppers
- anything from satellite phones, to night vision goggles, to heated insoles. In all
likelihood, none of that is worth the cost. If I had to pick two extravagant
"doomsday" accessories that could conceivably be useful to some people if something
truly awful happens to the world, I'd go with
a waterproof hiking GPS unit and a portable Geiger counter. Both
can be powered by AAA/AA batteries and cost under $200. (We'll talk about Geiger counters
and their relative merits a bit later on.)
Inspired by science fiction books and a handful of real-world incidents, some
hardcore survivalists worry that their portable electronics or vehicles could be
disabled by EMP weapons
or solar flares. The concern over solar flares is misplaced; the threat of EMP is a tad
more valid, but even if EMP warfare came to pass, small electronics and quasi-shielded automotive
circuitry would probably not be permanently affected by anything other than a
close blast. Power plants and transmission lines are a different story. Heck, in 1989, solar
flares knocked out  a good
chunk of the Canadian power grid. Still, for that, a surge protector works better than tinfoil.
4.5. Essential tools 
While not all urban-dwelling readers may be particularly interested in DIY work, there are times when
it's hard to call a handyman. So, almost every home will benefit from having a well-maintained "emergency"
toolbox containing several items useful for performing basic repairs and dealing with other minor incidents:

Having a medium-size bucket at home is a
must, too. If you own a bicycle and are expecting to use it in emergencies, it would be wise to
throw in a bike tool,
several tire levers,
a patch kit,
one or two spare tubes,
and a portable pump.

Finally, for those who are worried about the decidedly unlikely prospect of having to escape home
and fight off radscorpions in the wilderness, a
lightweight hatchet, a comfortable saw, a larger fixed-blade knife, a folding shovel, a
compass and some matches or a lighter in a waterproof container
can come handy in several ways.


A subset of this is also worth keeping in a car. It's not just about zombies or life-and-death situations:
if you hit something in a parking lot and your bumper cover comes off or your liftgate won't stay
shut, it's nice to be able to tie it down and get back on the road. Similarly, a shovel can help you
get back on the road after getting stuck in snow or mud. But speaking of survival: a pocket
knife, kept within reach (e.g., in the center console), can be used to cut
seat belts if you get into a wreck; and in a pinch, it will double as a self-defense tool.
Belt cutters can also fulfill that first task,
and may be easier to operate if you are hurt - although they are less useful for other purposes.
I'd also
recommend getting an automatic center punch -
it's a neat $5 tool that effortlessly shatters tempered glass (i.e., side and rear windows) when
the doors won't budge. It works way better
than many of the specialized car escape devices sold on the Internet.

If you own a house, especially in a region prone to earthquakes or tropical storms, you should
probably have a sledgehammer, a chainsaw (with a charged battery or some fuel at hand), bolt cutters, and
a pry bar. These heavy tools are essential for clearing debris and getting to whatever's underneath. Keep
them far from your other supplies: if your primary stash gets pinned under other junk, you can use the tools
to get it out. Don't store pry bars and similar equipment in plain sight; robbers often use found
tools to force patio doors, to pop safes, or
worse.

No matter where you live, it's also nice to have some materials at hand to patch up broken windows on a stormy
night. Window security film can be used to keep broken
glass in place, while a roll of thick plastic sheeting or tarp from a hardware store can come handy for temporary
repairs; space permitting, you may also want to keep several wooden planks. For suburban and rural homes in regions
prone to extreme weather, pressboard and sandbags may be worthwhile, too.
Traditional sandbags tend to be extremely labor-intensive to fill, so plan accordingly; 
water-filled barriers (Hydrabarrier) are much easier to deploy, but cost more.
Absorbent sock-style barriers can be used to deal with
minor flooding, but only up to an inch of water or so; they may be less useful for inclement weather,
but may prove indispensable for dealing with backed-up sewage or similar ills.

And now, for something completely different: during a longer water outage, you won't be able to flush your
toilet - a little-appreciated but grave hygiene risk. When living in a single-family home, you should probably
get a shovel and a pickax: they are useful in the backyard either way, but if push comes to shove, such tools
allow you to dig out a latrine and address the sanitation problem in a fairly sustainable way. Of course, dumping
bagged human waste into trash will work for a while, too, but it quickly becomes a liability.

(Folks living next
to a pond or a creek, or who have a rainwater collection system, might be able to use this for flushing; but hauling
gallons upon gallons of water for flushing from a more distant location is bound to get old quick.)
4.6. Camping equipment 
Many hardcore preppers spend their time fantasizing about heroic survival in the endless, pristine wilderness,
equipped with nothing more than a bug out bag, a trusty rifle, and their own iron will.
But even in far more realistic situations, being able to set up a camp can be a valuable skill. During mass evacuations,
there is always a good chance of being stuck on a congested highway for a day or two, or reaching your destination only
to find out that all the hotels and motels are full. The benefits are clear for some
small-scale emergencies, too: if backed-up sewage makes your home uninhabitable for a while, setting up a tent
in a friend's backyard can be much cheaper than staying in a hotel for several weeks.

Above all, the nice thing about it is that camping gear doesn't need to just sit in your closet, collecting dust
on the off chance that something bad may happen a decade from now. You can simply grab it
and head out for the weekend every now and then; camping is fun, doubly so for kids. It's also a great opportunity
to test some of your other equipment, and spot potential flaws in your preparedness plans.

Especially if you're living in the suburbs or in the countryside, I recommend having the following items
at hand:


Essential for finding hospitable destinations, getting there, and finding alternative routes if something goes
wrong. I suggest getting both a country road atlas and a more detailed map of your county or state. If you have
a car, just keep them there - they may also come handy if you get lost and your cell phone dies.
Weather-appropriate clothing.

A well-maintained stash of warm clothes, including 
waterproof ponchos and rain boots. In a pinch, you can also use
metallized Mylar blankets: tie them with some
tape to make improvised rainproof, windproof, or thermally insulating clothing and hats, shoe liners,
and more.
The blankets cost very little and take up virtually no room, so I strongly suggest keeping some in your
car. If you're stranded in an inhospitable place, they could save your life.



The usual combo is an appropriately-sized, waterproofed tent, a set of sleeping bags & pads, and possibly
some compressible or inflatable pillows for comfort.
In cold weather or during heavy rainfall, it's also possible to shelter in your vehicle, with Mylar blankets
serving as a substitute for sleeping bags; and on a hot day, the same material and some rope can be used
to improvise a shade. Again, the blankets are worth having in your car at all times.



As discussed in section 4.3, one of the best ways to cook food 
or to sterilize drinking water on the go is to have several portable propane tanks,
a miniature stove,
and a lightweight covered pot. Some plastic dinnerware can be
a nice touch.

Make sure that the stove fits your propane tanks; you may need a Lindal valve adapter if not.


Yep. End up in the wrong part of the woods and these bastards can suck you dry. Go for
40% DEET 20% picaridin. Actually, get both.


Of course, there is also the luxury option: buying a camper or an RV. Such vehicles are frowned upon
in many cities, but if you are in a rural area, if it's within your budget, and if you can see yourself
using it regularly, go for it - and don't look back.
4.7. Hygiene, health, environmental protection 
Humans are pretty fragile. In many of the more serious scenarios discussed in this guide, your
survival or well-being may be critically dependent on the ability to deal with incidental medical
emergencies, to curb the spread of communicable diseases, or to maintain sanitary conditions at home.

Of course, there are situations where prompt medical attention is simply a necessity; for
example, although it may be theoretically possible for an untrained enthusiast equipped with
an anatomy handbook to perform appendectomy, the odds of the patient surviving are pretty damn
low. That said, outside the domain of major surgery, the outlook is not necessarily as grim -
so even when professional help is not available right away, not all hope may be lost.
4.7.1. Health & hygiene topic #1: Basic cleaning supplies 
Before we dive into heady stuff, let's talk good housekeeping!

It pays to be prepared for nasty spills or sanitation emergencies. In addition to some of the tools 
discussed in earlier chapters, a good starting point is a large box of 13 gallon 
trash bags,
another box of thick, 42 gallon contractor bags,
a set of disposable nitrile gloves,
some rubbing alcohol, and a bottle of regular laundry bleach. Rubbing alcohol is an excellent
solvent and a rapid-evaporating disinfectant; bleach is a potent, long-lasting biocide and
a great odor neutralizer. Oh - as noted earlier, an
absorbent sock-style barrier may
be useful for containing particularly nasty spills, too.

When it comes to comfort and personal hygiene, I would also suggest stockpiling a carton of toilet paper, a
pack of old-school soap bars, a bottle of
no-rinse body wash and shampoo (to conserve water), some antiperspirant,
toothpaste and a toothbrush, nail clippers or scissors, and several disposable razors. At home, such items
can come handy only during prolonged emergencies; but as a part of your in-car kit, they are invaluable if you
are ever stuck somewhere or forget to take your toiletries with you on a camping trip.

As mentioned earlier, water outages can create an unpleasant problem with the disposal of human
waste. While a bucket with a trash bag can be used as an impromptu toilet, to keep the conditions
sanitary, some form of waste treatment is a must. A cheap option is pouring a layer of
clumping (bentonite-based) kitty litter over it after every use; other budget solutions include
cement and lime. More expensive choices are gelling agents and RV waste digestants.

Laundry is another (if slightly less pressing) problem that many preppers may have to reckon with.
Well-chosen antiperspirants and BZK-based antimicrobal sprays
do wonders to control bodily odors and extend the life of undergarments.
Beyond that, careful hand-washing and rinsing techniques help minimize waste - but when there is
no running water, doing laundry is still going to be a rare luxury for most.
4.7.2. Health & hygiene topic #2: Visibility on the road 
In addition to assorted tools and hygiene supplies, your car kit should probably include
a high-visibility vest; if your vehicle gives up
life, it's better to be visible when trying to revive it or walking to get help. I'm less convinced about
the benefits of carrying flares or flare guns; while they can be useful in serious emergencies, they
also pose some fire risk.
4.7.3. Health & hygiene topic #3: Medical education 
Before you even think about self-medicating or treating wounds, you should get a reasonably systematic
understanding of emergency medicine. I recommend getting
"Wilderness Medicine: Beyond First Aid": it
is accessible, focuses on situations where diagnostic and treatment facilities are limited, and
goes well beyond the basics. Just as importantly, it avoids weird spiritual, homeopathic, or
naturopathic claims that often creep up in prepper books.

Two other publications I can recommend are
"Where There is No Doctor" and
"Where There is No Dentist" by the 
Hesperian Foundation.
They pay less attention to contemporary meds or nuanced emergency procedures,
and spend more time on holistic, community-oriented care for practitioners in some of the most
impoverished regions of the world. This probably makes the publications worthwhile for
hardcore preppers who worry about widespread, long-term cataclysms.

Now, even after reading all these, don't get too cocky: there are good reasons why it takes about
10 years to become a doctor, and why it involves not just reading a book or two, but also dissecting
cadavers and watching other medics at work. When trying to render medical aid, not understanding the limits
of your knowledge can literally kill.
4.7.4. Health & hygiene topic #4: Common meds 
When living in squalor conditions and running short on supplies, even seemingly prosaic medical conditions can
become life-threatening. For example, in less developed countries, otherwise non-lethal diarrheal
diseases cause almost 2.5 million deaths every year. The reason is simple: without proper care,
the disease makes it easy for the victims to 
get terminally dehydrated or succumb to severe electrolyte imbalance.

And it's not all about dying, too: a nasty toothache or a debilitating allergy can make it very
difficult to stay productive and alert. With all that in mind, my list of essential and easily available
prepper medicines includes
ibuprofen (pain relief),
cetirizine (allergy management),
amoxicillin (broad-spectrum antibiotic),
loperamide (anti-diarrheal),
meclizine (prevents vomiting),
miconazole nitrate (treats fungal skin infections),
bacitracin ointment (bacterial skin infections),
topical lidocaine (anesthetic), and
hydrocortisone cream (anti-itch).
For disinfecting your hands and cleaning wounds,
benzalkonium chloride wipes can work pretty well;
for burns, many people swear by
hydrogel dressing or creams, too.
Finally, for treating severe dehydration, try
oral rehydration packs.

Manufacturers' expiration dates on all meds are very conservative, but even the US
government
intentionally
ignores them for its stockpiles of shelf-stable drugs. As far as I can tell, when stored in a
fridge, all of these products should be good for 5+ years.

Of course, if you need any prescription meds to survive, try to get a reserve. Except for
the case of narcotic painkillers, most doctors should be quite willing to help. In contrast to
the shelf-stable substances discussed earlier on, be very careful with expiration dates if your
stockpile includes any easily perishable drugs (say, insulin).

A handful of OTC dietary supplements may be useful for treating some chronic conditions
in situations where prescription drugs are not available - but if you want to
learn more, be prepared to wade through a sea of low-quality research and outright
quackery. Preliminary but somewhat plausible
findings include the apparent antidepressant properties of saffron and fish oil,
the beneficial effects of curcumin on some types of chronic pain, or the
utility of berberine and salacia reticulata in managing type 2 diabetes. Again, tread carefully;
 is a good starting point for getting the data behind some of the claims.

Ah, one more thing: for you car kit, I recommend getting some ibuprofen and
caffeine pills. Sure,
if you are getting sleepy, you should pull over and get some rest - but if you really can't, 
caffeine can help you stay alert. Note that it's possible to overdose; the symptoms are
typically just very unpleasant, but in rare cases, can be life-threatening.
4.7.5. Health & hygiene topic #5: Dental emergencies 
Blame modern diets, blame our longevity, or blame the mistakes of mother nature - but the bottom line is that for most humans,
dental problems are a question of "when", not "if". And when excruciating pain strikes at an inopportune time, it's really no
laughing matter: in absence of adequate medical care, tooth problems have been known to push some people to the verge of suicide.

Unfortunately for preppers, the management of serious pain in an emergency situation is tricky: virtually all the
potent painkillers have narcotic properties and are very illegal to buy or possess without a prescription. Fixing the
underlying tooth problem can be similarly elusive: you need expert knowledge and a collection of expensive and bulky
tools: high-speed drills, suction units, and so forth. In the end, the best preparedness strategy is just prevention:
take good care of your mouth and stop by for a routine checkup at least once a year.

Of course, while this approach reduces the odds of being blindsided by a painful problem, it does not make the risk go away:
a chipped tooth or a painful abscess can strike with virtually no warning. If you can't see a dentist right away, OTC painkillers
can offer partial relief, but no amount of ibuprofen will let you forget about an exposed nerve. Topical
benzocaine ointments may work better in some situations, but they don't
last very long. Sometimes, swishing some cold water in your mouth, or sucking in air through a carefully positioned straw, can offer
decent relief. In the longer haul, amoxicillin can clear up many dental infections, while
zinc
oxide / eugenol cement can be used for emergency repair of damaged teeth. There are some reports that repeated treatments of
cavities with
silver nitrate
can be beneficial, too - but be aware that the substance is caustic and tends to semi-permanently stain skin (and anything else it
comes into contact with).
4.7.6. Health & hygiene topic #6: Hemorrhage and wound management 
Severe bleeding is one of the major causes of death following an injury. It's an emergency
on its own, and knowing how to manage it until help arrives can make all the difference between
life and death.

A decent hemorrhage kit should probably include a generous amount of bandages (3M Vetrap is particularly convenient),
a tourniquet,
clotting gauze, and some duct tape.
You should read the manuals and consult an up-to-date first-aid guide, but the basic
idea is to apply lots of pressure to any profusely bleeding wounds. This can be done
with bandages, clothing, duct tape, or even your elbow, knee, or hips. Clotting gauze or sponges,
when pushed into the wound cavity, can help stop bleeding more quickly and stabilize the
victim. Tourniquets used to be frowned upon in the past, but when dealing with major
trauma to a limb, they sure beat bleeding out to death; it's just that they cause some
tissue injury, and if kept on for too long, necrosis may set in and the limb may have to go.

Don't just keep that stuff in your home; it's actually more important to have such a kit in your car (ideally in
the center console) and carry something equivalent when biking, hiking, climbing, hunting,
or engaging into other injury-prone sports.
There are some lightweight ready-made kits that may do the trick, although making your own is always a better choice.

In addition to such immediately necessary supplies,
some prepper guides recommend purchasing sutures, along with tissue forceps and hemostatic clamps.
Such equipment may be useful for neatly closing major wounds in situations where bandages won't do -
but suturing correctly requires a fair amount of practice and know-how.

For gnarly cuts, 
skin staplers or skin closure strips (necessarily with benzoin swabs)
tend to involve less hassle - and are harder to mess up.

For longer-term wound management, in addition to hydrogels and benzalkonium chloride disinfectants
discussed earlier on, there is some utility to
non-adherent dressing and ABD pads. In a pinch,
when dealing with high-drainage wounds, sanitary pads should also do the trick.
4.7.7. Health & hygiene topic #7: Broken or crushed limbs 
Your emergency medicine book will go into more details about setting bones, applying splints,
or even doing field amputations with a knife and a saw. But even just to deal with a sprained ankle, a
folding cane may be good to have somewhere in your
stash. Beyond that, bandages are useful for improvising splints; in areas where improvisation may be
difficult - say, in the desert or up in the mountains - portable folding splints (SAM splints)
can be handy, too.
4.7.8. Health & hygiene topic #8: Respiratory and environmental protection 
When it comes to transmittable diseases, your best bet is avoiding exposure: if there's something really
nasty making the rounds in your community, stay home - or at the very least, avoid public transit, cancel non-essential
air travel, and avoid other crowds. This includes grocery stores, farmers markets, restaurants and bars, concerts, sports events,
and non-essential trips to healthcare facilities. Under such circumstances, online delivery is vastly preferable to doing groceries
in person, but if that option is not available, it's best to do shopping off-peak - say, 6am or 11pm.

With all that in mind, despite numerous misconceptions, properly-worn N95 masks probably provide adequate protection against most
airborne diseases. The other major transmission vector is hand contact, so don't touch other people,
avoid public-use surfaces, and resist the instinct to touch your face without first washing
or disinfecting your hands (we subconsciously touch our faces a lot more frequently than we suspect).

Because a restroom is not always within reach, and contact with door handles or grocery carts can be difficult to completely avoid,
buying some hand sanitizer to put in your backpack, purse, or in your pocket, is a pretty solid plan. Hand sanitizer by the door
also helps establish a routine where the entire family can clean hands immediately after entering the house, without waiting for
the bathroom and possibly touching other items on the way.

Similarly to respirators, hand sanitizer sells out quickly during pandemic scares - but if you miss that train, you can make your own from
rubbing alcohol, water, and a commonly-available gelling agent such as methylcellulose.
Disposable gloves may be a viable alternative in some scenarios, too.

If you worry about releases from chemical plants or overturned ammonia tankers,
3M multi-gas cartridges and half facepieces may offer robust protection when sized
and fitted properly. That said, in most cases, it's more important to develop a plan for sealing your home;
walk around and take note of any crawl space inlets, bathroom and kitchen exhausts, chimneys,
fireplaces, and any other gaps. In an emergency, you can cover them with trash bags and duct tape.

Although we are entering the realm of extremely unlikely events, if you genuinely worry about
encountering an overturned chemical tanker while driving down the highway,
3M 5512 escape respirators offer decent short-term
protection against many threats. In addition to low price, their major advantage is their small size; you
could conceivably have one for every occupant, and just store that gear in the vehicle.

Of course, some extreme preppers will settle for nothing less than a military-grade gas mask rated for
chemical, biological, and nuclear warfare. While it is true that such masks offer much better protection
against nerve agents and similar extremely harmful substances, it's not a likely concern in most parts
of the world - and either way, it's doubtful that you would have enough time to suit up once the symptoms
kick in.

On a perhaps more realistic note: since many of the common and harmful industrial gases are highly
water-soluble, breathing through a wet towel or other moist piece of cloth, or draping it to form a
tent over an infant's car seat or a stroller, might offer some very short-term protection when
all other options fail.
4.7.9. Health & hygiene topic #9: Vector control 
In some parts of the world, mosquitoes, flies, and other biting insects are major vectors for extremely
serious diseases, such as malaria, African sleeping sickness, dengue fever, or lymphatic filariasis. The same is not
a grave concern in more temperate climates; although malaria used to be a problem in some of the southern states,
it has been eradicated since 1951. Today, some of the most serious incidents in the US and in Europe are the occassional
cases of Lyme borreliosis or the West Nile virus.

Still, if you are worried about the situation changing for the worse, repellents such as DEET and picaridin can
provide the first line of defense. Beyond that, more radical solutions may include
electric bug zappers
(especially when coupled with mosquito attractants, such as octenol or lactic acid),
permethrin insecticide sprays, mesh jackets,
window screens,
and bed nets. For crawling insects, borax and
diatomaceous earth can act as a deadly barrier, too.

While serious zoonotic diseases can be also spread by birds, rodents, or even cats and dogs, such vectors
are more easily controlled or avoided by maintaining sanitary conditions at home; in extreme cases,
traps or poisons such as bromadiolone may do the trick, but unless you are living in a place prone
to infestations, I wouldn't worry too much.
4.7.10. Health & hygiene topic #10: Dealing with nuclear fallout 
There are quite a few pop culture myths surrounding the dangers of nuclear incidents, contributing to a defeatist attitude
among even some of the most hardened preppers. But in reality, such events are a lot more survivable than portrayed in
fiction - and perhaps more importantly, the world that awaits the survivors would not necessarily be all that bleak. A good way to explore this topic is a book titled
"Nuclear War Survival Skills". It sounds goofy, but it's been written
by the folks who worked on the Manhattan Project, and is as close to scientific truth as you can get; plus, it is not copyrighted
and can be downloaded for free.

To summarize, let's start with the eponymous threat of nuclear war. A typical ICBM strike is likely to kill most people within a 1 to 10 mile
radius of the explosion, with most perishing due to the blast wave and intense heat, not gamma rays. In fact, contrary to popular lore and
as witnessed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when one sees a flash of light, ducking behind cover is quite likely to save their life. It's also
important to remember that even an "all out" nuclear exchange with another superpower would leave most of the United States unscathed.
It would not turn the planet into a post-apocalyptic wasteland - not any more than the hundreds of nuclear tests conducted in the
twentieth century.

The fallout threat tends to be overblown, too. For one, air bursts, which are preferred because of their improved blast radius,
do not produce that much of it; far more tends to be released during nuclear power plant meltdowns or ground bursts.
In any case, whatever gets kicked up in the air can travel hundreds of miles before settling down. So, in the aftermath of
an incident, getting indoors and sealing your home should be your first instinct. Basic respiratory protection can help, too.

At first, the falling dust will be extremely radioactive and even short-term exposure might be lethal - so your best bet
would be to seek shelter in the basement, or near the center of mass of any other building. This maximizes the mass between
you and the outside world, shielding you from the gamma rays produced by whatever happens to settle on the roof and the outside
walls. The density and volume of the shielding material matters more than anything else. It does not have to be lead; mattresses
and bulky furniture should do.

Luckily for the survivors, the highly radioactive isotopes present in the fallout are also very-short lived; the intensity of radiation
will likely drop ten-fold within 6-8 hours, and will decrease a hundred-fold within two days. If you wait a week or two, it
should be quite safe to venture out. Of course, it's still best to stay indoors for as long as possible, and when heading out,
it's good to keep the trips short, to wear disposable coveralls, and
to take care not to track any residues into your home. But you don't need to lock yourself in an underground vault for a decade or
two.

This brings us to an interesting question: if the radioactivity decays so quickly, why aren't people moving back to
Fukushima or Chernobyl? Well... save for several small hotspots, the exclusion zones are safe to walk around,
but it can be more dangerous to drink contaminated water or eat local wildlife or crops.
Our body may end up using some of the longer-lived radioisotopes as biological building blocks - which would expose us
to low-grade radiation, at an  close range, for the rest of our lives. While it is usually not a death
sentence, this phenomena is bound to produce a measurable spike in mortality across any sufficiently 
large population. It is more humane and more socially acceptable to keep people out.

Still, this does not mean that the survivors of a nuclear war would have to choose between starvation and poisoning.
Water and food stored in closed
containers will not become radioactive - people would just have to be mindful of the dust on top. Crops can be grown after removing 
several inches of topsoil, and most rivers, streams, and creeks become safe quite rapidly (shallow bodies of standing water are a
different animal). In other words, with basic precautions, it's quite possible to thrive in the aftermath of even the
worst nuclear war. All it takes is some luck and a bit of knowledge; blast-proof bunkers are not a must.

In fact, one of the more consequential health consequences of nuclear accidents is also very easy to manage: it's the release of
copious amounts of radioactive iodine, a short-lived substance that gets absorbed by the thyroid gland. To deal with this
issue, people in the affected areas are typically offered potassium iodide pills; this temporarily saturates
thyroid and prevents any further uptake of iodine for a couple of days or weeks. Such tablets are 
available over-the-counter and dirt cheap, so
it's not a bad idea to have some at hand.

Other than that, there isn't much that can be done to limit the damage caused by serious exposure to radiation. Some animal
studies suggest that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an OTC dietary supplement, can have fairly pronounced
radioprotective benefits. While the evidence is very preliminary and the quality of the studies is lacking, the substance is believed to be pretty safe,
so you can certainly 
grab some just in case. Another potentially beneficial
OTC products along the same lines
are diindolylmethane (DIM), n-acetylcysteine (NAC), pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), vitamin C, and melatonin.

With all this out of the way, let's get back to a gadget mentioned a bit earlier in this guide: Geiger counters.
Unless you're an emergency responder, you may not really need one. That said, such a device could conceivably
help you stay informed and keep your family and friends at ease - and I don't mean just the remote possibility of
a nuclear war. Consider all the bogus rumors of contaminated
water and food in the aftermath of Fukushima; a radiation meter could have put any such speculation to rest.

Of course, to use a Geiger counter effectively, you need to know how to interpret the results. Although some
controversy exists, the prevailing view is that the effects of radiation are cumulative in a fairly linear fashion;
here's what you can expect once you hit a particular dose:
 no immediate effects. A marginal but measurable increase in
the likelihood of developing cancer later in life (+0.5%). This dose was 
received by a handful of residents during the Fukushima disaster in 2011. mild radiation sickness and a substantial increase in lifetime
cancer risk (around +6%). A dose that might have been
received by some subset of residents near Chernobyl in 1986. severe radiation sickness with vomiting and hair loss. Dangerous
but with good chances of survival. A pretty substantial risk of cancer down the line (+12%). typically lethal, although there is a chance of recovery with
proper medical treatment. Survivors are highly likely to develop cancer later on. nearly always fatal. A dose received by some of the first responders
at Chernobyl.
Some Geiger counters can keep track of the cumulative dose for you, but most will
simply display the rate at which you are getting exposed - typically in microsieverts
per hour (µSv/h) or microroentgens per hour (µR/h; for gamma radiation,
1 R/h ≈ 1/100 Sv/h).
To figure out what the reading means, you need to do the math: for example, at 600 µSv/h,
you will hit 100 mSv within a week, and 1 Sv within about two months. (The usual background
rate from natural sources hovers around 0.1-0.2 µSv/h.)

For folks interested in getting a nice, compact Geiger counter, Radex One
is pretty hard to beat;
it is tiny, inexpensive, and can be hooked up to a PC to continuously monitor the environment (and send e-mail or SMS alerts). 
The one caveat is that similarly to many other low-cost units,
this device maxes out at 1 mSv/h - enough to know that something is very wrong, but not enough to tell if
you're going to receive a life-threatening dose in an hour or somewhere within the next six months. In other words, some of the more hardcore
preppers may want to invest in a more capable unit, such as ADM-300 (which goes all the way to 100 Sv/h) or RAD-60R (3 Sv/h).
Decommissioned military and civilian devices in excellent working condition can be found on eBay for around $200.
4.8. Self-defense and personal security 
As discussed earlier in this guide, we face surprisingly high lifetime odds of becoming victims of
burglary, assault, or other major crime. To deal with this danger, the guide promotes a handful of passive
risk avoidance and loss minimization strategies, with the bulk of this advice found in section 3.5.
But it would be dishonest to claim that such methods will always shield us from harm - so in this
chapter, let's have a look at some of the tools that serve as the last line of defense when 
all other approaches fail.
4.8.1. Defense topic #1: Protecting your personal property 
It is fiendishly difficult to safeguard your belongings when you're not home. When dealing
with opportunistic burglaries, a heavy, bolted-down safe, ideally ordered directly from a reputable
manufacturer, is probably your best defensive tool. Against sophisticated adversaries on a
targeted job, almost all bets are off; in such cases, 
operational security (section 3.5.3) is more important than any amount of high-tech gear.

Now, when asked about the best way to make a residence burglar-proof, most people would
probably mention getting an alarm system. But alarm systems are fairly weak deterrents
against theft; most statistics suggest that they reduce the likelihood of a break-in 
by around 50%. So, do the math: take the costs of installing an alarm system (probably around
$2,000 for a comprehensive solution), plus the ongoing monitoring fees (easily $200-$500/year),
and then contrast these numbers with the likely loss in case of one or two break-ins over the
next several decades. Keep in mind that even if the numbers are favorable, a high-quality safe
($500+) may still be a more cost-effective approach.

Alarm systems aside, cameras are another popular security tool. They do relatively little to
deter theft, but can document all sorts of problematic encounters - and in the event of a burglary,
perhaps improve the odds of recovering stolen goods.
Decent wi-fi cameras start at $100 a piece; many models can record to a local SD card, although
having a centralized DVR unit, ideally stowed away in an inconspicuous place, will
make the system more robust.

Some preppers advocate "hardening" the perimeter of your home. The returns on this investment will
vary; for example, high-security locks and reinforced doors may be worthwhile in high-rise
apartment buildings, where the front door may be the only way in. For single-family homes, the
burglars will probably not bother with the locks at all; forcing open a bathroom window takes
much less work. Tall fences and locked backyard gates can help, although their benefits are
limited in rural areas or in shady neighborhoods.

The other tools worth mentioning here may be remote motion detectors, such as
passive IR monitors or beam sensors. They won't do squat
when you're not on premises, but when you're home, they can give you an advance warning
about unwanted visitors. It's a remote concern, but the sensors are relatively cheap, so
just do what feels right.

As for cars: there is no hope. Don't leave anything of substantial value in the vehicle, and
if the car itself is valuable, have it insured against theft (setting your deductible to $1,000
or more  keep the premiums low). Avoid tempting the thieves
in any way: countless car windows have been smashed over a $5 bill and some coins left
in the cup holder. Put spare change somewhere else.
4.8.2. Defense topic #2: Limiting liability for car accidents 
Vehicular accidents are depressingly common; while defensive driving can limit your
risk, the possibility of injuring another person or causing property damage never really
goes away. When you are involved in a car wreck in unclear circumstances, or when your
statements do not match the words of another driver, video evidence may be the best way
to escape criminal charges or to resolve civil claims.

It used to be that dashcams were prohibitively expensive; but today, the prices
start at $50, so it makes sense to give the devices a try. I can recommend
Rexing V1, but there are
countless other options to choose from. The bottom line is, if you own a car, it's
probably the most affordable and meaningful liability insurance policy you can get.
4.8.3. Defense topic #3: Fighting for your life 
In theory, a person's natural right to self-defense is broadly recognized in much of the
western world - but in practice, different societies look at it in very different ways. Today,
in much of Europe, the very notion that one private citizen could lawfully harm another human
being is met with suspicion and distaste; the control over life and death is more willingly
delegated to the agents of the state.

These differences manifest in how the regulators around the globe approach anything from
knives to pepper spray - but of course, no topic is more contentious than firearms. The debate about
the social benefits and costs of gun ownership is 
hopelessly
polarizing and clouded by emotion; I'm certain that roughly half of the folks reading this document
have a very visceral, negative reaction to the very idea that a private person should be allowed
to carry a gun - and I do not honestly expect to change their minds.

That said, when we look beyond the dogma, the underlying facts paint
an 
incredibly nuanced picture of the right to bear arms - putting into question many of the deeply-held and seemingly
common-sense beliefs. For example, despite the striking ubiquity of legally owned
firearms in the United States - about one per every resident - the country historically enjoyed
lower per-capita rates of suicide, robbery, assault, or rape, compared to some of its esteemed European
peers.

Of course, this observation ignores one important fact: compared to EU countries, the US
suffers from a markedly elevated (but rapidly falling) rate of homicide. About two thirds of homicides are committed with
guns - but lest we jump to conclusions, the non-firearm-related murder rate alone puts America well
ahead of most of Europe, suggesting that the cause may have to do with societal differences as much 
as with the availability of a particular tool. A finding that supports this theory is the fact that upward of 80%
of US gun homicides 
trace back to gang activity and drug trade,
often within the disadvantaged or impoverished strata of the society.
Another telling observation is that comparisons of overall murder rates across US states or across EU countries
with vastly different firearms ownership profiles 
don't reveal a convincing
correlation between the two variables - something you would expect to see if legally owned
guns had a causative relationship with violent crime.

Of course, these points can be debated, and there's ample evidence to cherry-pick in support of any view.
But there is also a more utilitarian way of looking at it. From an individualistic, survival-focused
point of view, the social costs (real or imagined) are essentially moot: if you live in a place where guns
are readily available to criminals, it's hard to think of a violent confrontation where not owning a
firearm would give you the upper hand. While the data is a bit dicey, there is a body of research showing that
defensive gun uses happen in the US at a rate of somewhere 
south of 500,000 times a year,
with almost all confrontations resolved without firing a single shot. The inherent dangers of owning
a firearm are often overstated by gun control advocates, too: unintentional injury or death due to
having a gun at home is
comparatively rare, and is almost
always a consequence of blatant disregard for basic safety rules.

All in all, it's OK to reject armed self-defense (or shun guns in particular) on religious or moral
grounds - but doing so is probably not a particularly rational decision within the scope of this
guide. From a rational standpoint, you should always pick the tools that are best suited for the scenarios
you anticipate (provided that the state allows you to). Of course, a firearm is not always the
answer, so let's take a broader look at some of the most popular options for shooing away looters or
defending yourself:


No deterrent effect, but surprisingly effective when a confrontation can't be avoided -
 especially when facing a single assailant.
Reserved for people who are physically fit and willing to invest a fair amount of time into training. One of the most pragmatic
and widely-taught schools is Krav Maga, and there's certainly no harm in checking it out.



An excellent, temporarily incapacitating weapon - very difficult to resist and capable of buying you just
enough time to escape. Works quickly and reliably at distances up to perhaps 10 feet; can also stop some animal
attacks. Usually not heavily regulated, making it easy to obtain and carry even in places
that frown upon other forms of armed self-defense (but check the laws). Pepper spray becomes less effective in
strong wind; there is also some risk of blowback, but this is mitigated in narrow-stream products,
such as Sabre Pepper Gel.


Very lethal and dangerous at close quarters, but only provided that you have the element of
surprise on your side. They require some degree of physical fitness and training to use well.
Their value is diminished when facing multiple assailants or dealing with a gun-wielding
individual: even if you stab them, you are probably still gonna get shot. In a handful of places,
carrying a knife may be illegal or subject to somewhat confusing
restrictions, so perform due diligence if you want to take this route.


A nice idea, in theory. Unfortunately, most products require direct body contact with the attacker,
are easily foiled by clothing, and may be less effective against people who are well-built,
unusually agitated, or just high on drugs. While it's a popular self-defense choice, I can't honestly
recommend it over pepper spray.

(Projectile-type stun guns, such as Taser C2, are far better and work at a distance - but
you need to have perfect aim on first try. They also cost quite a bit.)


A very effective and supremely intimidating weapon, with lethality ranging from
20% for handguns to 80% for shotguns; for a novice user, the effective range is somewhere
between 10 and 100 yards. Guns are heavily regulated in much of the world, but widely
available in the US - although there are several states or municipalities that make it
very difficult to get a permit unless you are
a celebrity
or a prominent donor.

Even if your local government does not issue carry permits or erects other bureaucratic roadblocks, 
having a firearm in your home can provide
a very effective deterrent in case of home intrusions. That said, a gun is also a responsibility:
similarly to a chainsaw, you are either serious about following the safety rules, or somebody may get
hurt.

Interestingly, the legal bar for claiming self-defense is typically no different whether you are
using a less-lethal weapon or lethal force. But of course, the legal and psychological consequences of
being wrong can be far more severe if you kill a person, versus just making their eyes itch. There are
no easy answers, so do some soul-searching first. If you can't imagine killing another person to protect
your family - and living with the consequences - don't get a knife or a gun.
4.8.4. Defense topic #4: Understanding firearms 
If you are contemplating getting a gun for home defense or for more outlandish survival scenarios,
the first choice you will face is between a handgun, a shotgun, and a rifle. Here's what you need to know:


This category encompasses a wide selection of small, lower-powered firearms that can be easily carried
without attracting attention. Most have a fairly modest stopping power, so-so ballistics,
and require quite a bit of
practice to accurately hit anything more than 10 yards away. A telling statistic is that in shootouts,
the police have a hit rate of less than 30%; contrary to what some gun control supporters
claim, an average policeman does not get that much practice, and probably trains less than your typical
gun enthusiast - but these numbers are still something to keep in mind.

Handguns are typically regulated more heavily than other firearms, in part because they account for
the overwhelming majority of all gun crime. If you can get one, your basic choice is between:
 Typically capable of firing
somewhere around 6 to 18 rounds from a removable magazine; reloading is very fast, provided that you carry
another magazine with you. Their user interface is relatively complex, and some knowledge is needed
to deal with potential misfires, jams, or to avoid negligent discharges - although the probability of
any such issues is generally very low. (It's wise to avoid bargain-bin ammo and magazines.)
 A more ancient type of a repeating firearm, usually holding 5 or 6 rounds in
a non-removable cylinder. They are functionally simple, very dependable, and pretty accurate - but
take more time to reload if it ever comes to that.

You may be tempted to go for the most lightweight and highest-powered handgun you can find, but you
would have to cope with punishing recoil and potentially blinding muzzle flash, so it's not always a
good call. In home defense situations, mid- to full-size 9mm pistols and .38 Special revolvers are probably
the sweet spot. There are countless models to choose from, but the bottom line is that you can't go particularly
wrong with Glock, Beretta, SIG Sauer, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, CZ, Heckler & Koch, or Springfield Armory.

If you need some starting points for your search, perhaps the most iconic and time-tested semi-auto design is the 1911; it
was originally a pretty bulky and heavy all-steel firearm, but many manufacturers now make
lighter, scaled-down variants that are OK for
carrying around. More modern, higher-capacity successors include pistols such as 
SIG P226 or CZ 75B; as well as a growing number of compact, polymer-frame guns, including
Glock 43, M&P Shield, or SIG P365.

For revolvers, Ruger SP101 and Smith & Wesson 642 are probably two very reasonable
picks to haul around. Some very futuristic if a tad more expensive
revolvers are made by Chiappa, too; Rhino 30DS and 40DS are two nice picks. 


Long, heavy guns, often with detachable magazines housing anywhere from 4 to 30 rounds. Rifles
fire high-velocity projectiles capable of accurately striking distant targets - and even a complete novice
should be able to hit targets 30-50 yards away. With plenty of practice (and expensive optics), some
rifles allow reliable hits at 1,000 yards or so.

The most popular category are semi-automatic rifles, including the scary-looking 
AR-15 clones,
the much less villainous Ruger Mini-14, and
a bunch of in-between choices, such as 
Fightlite SCR.
All three are known for reliability and good accuracy. Semi-automatics typically
fire relatively small but high-energy projectiles (e.g., .223 Remington / 5.56x45mm NATO); although considerably
louder than most handgun calibers, such projectiles are still somewhat suitable for home defense and
hunting small to medium game.

Another popular pick are bolt-action rifles, including  Remington 700, Winchester 70, Ruger Hawkeye,
and Ruger Precision Rifle.
Although there is a lot of variety, many are chambered for larger cartridges ideal for hunting big game 
(from .243 Winchester to .50 BMG) and are more suited for long-range shooting. For home defense,
overpenetration becomes a significant concern.

In the US, long guns are subject to fewer restrictions than handguns, chiefly because of their negligible
role in street crime; that said, "assault weapons" - i.e., semi-automatic rifles with scary-looking cosmetic
features, such as barrel shrouds or forward grips - have been a subject of recurring moral panics
and various state- or municipality-level restrictions and bans.

Perhaps interestingly, there is a handful of rifles chambered for handgun ammunition. The classics
include Ruger 77 series, Henry Big Boy, and the replicas of
Winchester Models 1873 and 1892 (e.g., Chiappa 1892 Alaskan);
some of the more modern semi-automatic options include Ruger PC and KelTec SUB2000.
In the prepper context, their appeal is that you only need to
keep one kind of ammo for two types of firearms. Putting a handgun caliber in a rifle gives you greatly
improved accuracy, virtually no recoil, comparatively quiet operation, and somewhat improved range - but going past
100 yards is still going to be a stretch.


Long, heavy, large-bore weapons with tremendous stopping power, variously firing one large metal
slug or a swarm of high-energy pellets; less-lethal rubber batons are also sometimes used for
crowd or animal control. Aimed as easily as rifles, but because of the less ergonomic shapes of
projectiles and their lower velocities, the effective range of a shotgun doesn't extend far
beyond 100-200 yards. In places such as Australia or the UK, buying a shotgun is subject to
fewer restrictions than other types of firearms.

Excellent for home defense, where they combine high stopping power and accuracy with reduced
risk of overpenetration (depending on the ammo used). Also popular for waterfowl hunting (where multiple projectiles reduce
the need for very precise aim), deer hunting, and for encounters with
predators such as mountain lions, bears, and the like.

Most shotguns pack a substantial amount of recoil and can easily bruise your shoulder -
although lower-powered loads or smaller-gauge
variants (e.g., 20 ga) can be operated by small-framed or younger shooters.
Capacity typically ranges from 2 to 8 shells. A very affordable, popular, and reliable
type of a shotgun is pump-action (reloaded by racking the slide); two of the best-known
examples are 
Remington 870 and Mossberg 590.

When it comes to self-defense, hollow point ammunition (HP / JHP) is preferred for rifles and handguns;
compared to solid metal bullets, it deforms and falls apart more readily on impact - therefore
reducing the risk of overpenetration and collateral damage.

If you decide to get a gun, you must learn how to operate it safely: sign up for a basic course
or have someone truly competent take you to the range. The basic safety rules can be summed up as:
 When picking up a gun, always assume that it's loaded. Don't trust others and 
definitely don't trust your own memory. Always double-check. If you don't know how to operate
a particular gun, ask before touching it. In firearms with removable magazines, always check the
chamber  removing the mag. Assume that you will eventually mess up rule #1, so when handling a gun, always keep it
pointed in a safe direction. "Sweeping" other people is a no-no, so is looking down the barrel.
At the shooting range, the safe direction is down range, toward the backstop.
At home, just be mindful of neighbors and people in other rooms. Assume that you will eventually break rules #1 and #2, so keep your finger off the
trigger unless the gun is aimed and you're ready to fire. When firing, know your target and what's beyond it. You don't want to shoot
a drunk family member in the middle of the night, or have a bullet go through your target and strike
a bystander.
With the rules internalized, you are extremely unlikely to cause unintentional harm. 
Keep practicing at least twice a month until you get good, and then go to the range at
least several times a year. Try to use
practice ammo with lead-free primers and clean bullets (e.g., RUAG Copper Matrix,
Magtech Clean Range, Winchester Super Clean, Winchester Frangible, Federal Ballisticlean,
Remington Disintegrator, Federal American Eagle TMJ, Federal Power-Shok Copper) and avoid
tracking lead residues from indoor ranges back home -
especially if you have small kids. Always wear hearing and eye protection, too.

Keep your firearms in a quick-access safe if you have young children or expect people with kids
to visit you every now and then. A safe is also a good way to deter opportunistic theft; a clever
hiding place will also do, but criminals often have the same ideas as you and know where to look.
Be smart about picking the right safe and placing it sensibly: you don't want to have to walk to the
other end of the house, or to fiddle with keys or rotary dials, when every second counts.
Electronic combination or biometric safes are usually pretty good, unless you go for the bargain bin
(don't).
5. Organizing and tracking your supplies 
Robust bookkeeping is an essential component of any preparedness plan. Without a neat
spreadsheet to go back to, you will eventually lose track of the stuff you have, won't be able to locate
critical supplies in a pinch, and won't know if and when your batteries, food, or meds have
gone bad.

To get it right, make a list of all your emergency gear, along with expiration dates where applicable.
Next, go through the list marking all the "stays home" stuff - the supplies that are impractical
to haul around or not particularly essential when evacuating. Make sure that all the tactical gear
- such as flashlights, fire extinguishers, first-aid kits, and self-defense weapons - are in a
logical and easily reached place. For the remaining "stay home" items,
just find an unobtrusive location, stow them away, and write the spot down in your spreadsheet.

The task of organizing the essentials you want to travel with is a bit
more involved. For car owners, I suggest preparing two separate kits:
Boxed evacuation essentials.

Camping and survival supplies to get you through at least one week, in case you need to leave home
and can't be sure about finding a hospitable location right away. The gear should be boxed
or bagged to make it easy to load into your vehicle. Include some amount of water and food,
and make sure that the entire kit actually fits into the car. For many US cars,
56 quart storage totes work very well.



A container always kept in the trunk, small enough so that it doesn't hinder your normal
use of the car, but substantial enough to help you survive several days (or cope with other,
more prosaic roadside emergencies). The kit should include 1-2 gallons of water, Mylar
blankets, rope, and other car supplies discussed earlier in the guide. A
collapsible water bottle and a folding daypack can be useful if you have
to walk on foot from a broken car to the nearest town. Throwing in
some cash - just enough to pay for gas, a meal, a motel room, or a ride home - is also a
good plan.


While you're at it, also check that you have a spare tire, a jack, a lug wrench, and a box of extra
fuses. They come optional on some very cheap cars, and may be simply missing when you buy a used one.
Some people find out too late.

Folks without a car are at a marked disadvantage, but should still try to put together
a 72-hour "bug out bag" - and ideally, keep it somewhere within a walking or biking
distance of their home (say, at work or at a friend's place). It's best to keep it light;
some cash, 2-4 quarts of water, a 3,600 kcal emergency ration, and a raincoat will be almost
certainly more useful than a gun and a collection of throwing knives.

Either way, when done with the list, be sure to re-read the response plans you drafted earlier on
and cross-reference them with this spreadsheet. Iterate until you're happy with both, then
print out the docs and place them somewhere intuitive. In a stressful situation, you will
be able to quickly review the printouts to confirm that you are not missing anything.

Here is a closing thought: 
rational prepping is meant to give you confidence to go about your business, knowing that you are
well-equipped to weather out adversities. It should not be about convincing yourself that the
collapse is just around the corner, and letting that thought consume and disrupt your life.

I'd stay positive: the world is probably not ending,
and there is a good chance that it will be
an even better place for our children than it is for us. But the universe is a harsh mistress, and
there is only so much faith we should be putting in good fortune, in benevolent governments, or in
the wonders of modern technology. So, always have a backup plan.

The data, collected by the U.S. Drought Monitor, is a welcome nugget of news for Golden State residents, who in the last 15 years alone have lived through two of the worst droughts on record, the worst wildfire seasons on record and the most destructive wildfires ever.Right now, the wildfire risk across California is “about as close to zero as it ever gets,” and there is likely no need to worry about the state’s water supply for the rest of the year, said UC climate scientist Daniel Swain. Currently, 14 of the state’s 17 major water supply reservoirs are at 70% or more capacity, according to the California Department of Water Resources.California’s last drought lasted more than 1,300 days, from February 2020 to October 2023, at which point just 0.7% of the state remained abnormally dry, thanks to a series of winter atmospheric rivers that showered the Golden State with rain.But the last time 0% of the California map had any level of abnormally dry or drought conditions was all the way back in December 2000. In recent weeks, a series of powerful winter storms and atmospheric rivers have swept across California, dumping heavy rain that soaked soils, filled reservoirs and left much of the state unusually wet for this time of year.“This is certainly a less destructive weather winter than last year was and than many of the drought years were, so it’s OK to take that breather and to acknowledge that, right now, things are doing OK,” Swain said. He noted, however, that “as we move forward, we do expect to be dealing with increasingly extreme [weather] swings.”Though it may seem counterintuitive, climate change is forecast to lead to both more intense droughts and more intense episodes of rainfall. This is because a warmer atmosphere pulls more moisture out of soils and plants, deepening droughts. At the same time, a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which is then released in fewer, more extreme rainstorms.Scientists have coined a name for this phenomenon — the atmospheric sponge effect — which Swain said is “hopefully an evocative visual analogy that describes why as the climate warms we actually are likely to see wider swings between extremely wet conditions and extremely dry conditions.”A key example of this effect is the weather pattern in the run-up to the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires last year. In 2022 and 2023, California experienced extremely wet winters. Mammoth Mountain, for example, set an all-time record for snowfall in the 2022-23 season.But then Southern California experienced one of the driest periods on record in the fall and winter of 2024, which enabled the subsequent devastation of January 2025’s firestorm. “We didn’t even have to be in a notable multiyear drought to have that sequence of really wet to really dry conditions lead us to a place where the fire risk was catastrophic,”Swain said.Recent storms have brought snow to the Sierra Nevada mountains, but the state’s snowpack remains below average. According to the Department of Water Resources, the snowpack now stands at 89% of average for this time of year.Much of the West has seen warmer-than-average temperatures and relatively little snow so far this winter. The snow in the Rocky Mountains remains far below average, adding to the strains on the overtapped Colorado River, a major water source for Southern California.Research published in the aftermath of the fire examines how this extremely wet to extremely dry weather sequence is especially dangerous for wildfires in Southern California because heavy rainfall leads to high growth of grass and brush, which then becomes abundant fuel during periods of extreme dryness. Fortunately, California should be clear of water supply risks and wildfire danger for several months to come, Swain said, but in the long term, residents should expect to see more of this weather whiplash. writer Ian James contributed to this report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Which AI Lies Best?

If customers accidentally delete their data, they can recover it, which makes work easier for customer support teams.
Perhaps archived records are even required for compliance or audit reasons.I've run into some trouble with soft delete designs. I'll cover those, and ponder ideas for how I'd build this in the future.Adding an  column seems to ooze complexity out into queries, operations, and applications.
Recovering deleted records does happen, but 99% of archived records are never going to be read.So, the database tables will have a lot of dead data. Depending on access patterns, that might even be a significant amount of data.
I've seen APIs that didn't work well with Terraform, so Terraform would delete + recreate records on every run, and over time that led
to millions of dead rows. Your database can probably handle the extra bytes, and storage is fairly cheap, so it's not necessarily a problem, at first.Hopefully, the project decided on a retention period in the beginning, and set up a periodic job to clean up those rows.
Unfortunately, I'd bet that a significant percentage of projects did neither – it's really easy to ignore the archived data for a long time.At some point, someone might want to restore a database backup. Hopefully that's for fun and profit and not because you lost the production database at 11 am.
If your project is popular, you might have a giant database full of dead data that takes a long time to recreate from a dump file. columns also complicate queries, operations, and application code. Applications need to make sure they always avoid the archived data that's sitting
right next to the live data. Indexes need to be careful to avoid archived rows. Manual queries run for debugging or analytics are longer and more complicated.
There's always a risk that archived data accidentally leaks in when it's not wanted. The complexity grows when there are mapping tables involved.Migrations have to deal with archived data too. Migrations may involve more than just schema changes – perhaps you need to fix a mistake with default values, or add a new column and backfill values.
Is that going to work on records from 2 years ago? I've done migrations where these questions were not trivial to answer.Restoring an archived record is not always as simple as just running  – creating a record may involve making calls to external systems as well.
I've seen complex restoration code that was always a buggy, partial implementation of the "create" API endpoint. In the end, we removed the specialized restoration code
and required all restoration to go through the standard APIs – that simplified the server implementation, and ensured that old data that had since become invalid, could not
be restored incorrectly – it needs to pass the new validation rules.I'm not a fan of the  column approach. It's simple at first, but in my experience, it's full of pitfalls down the line.Let's look at some alternatives (in PostgreSQL): application events, triggers, and logical replication.All these approaches store archived data separately from live data – that may be a separate database table, a separate database, object storage, etc.One team I worked with took the approach of emitting an event at the application layer when a record was deleted. The event was sent to SQS, and another service would archive that object to S3 (among other things).This had a few big benefits:The primary database and application code were substantially simpler.Deleting a resource involved cleaning up resources in various external systems.
Handling this in an async background system improved performance and reliability.The record and all its related records can be serialized to JSON in an application-friendly layout, rather than a serialized database table layout, so it's easier to work with.It's more likely to have a bug in the application code, and indeed this happened more than
once, which meant archived records were lost and manual cleanup of external resources was necessary.It's more infrastructure to understand and operate: multiple services, a message queue, etc.Archived objects in S3 were not easy to query – finding records to restore required extra tooling from the customer support teams.A trigger can copy a row to an archive table before it's deleted. The archive table can be a single, generic table that stores JSON blobs:CREATE TABLE archive (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    record_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    caused_by_table TEXT,
    caused_by_id TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_archive_table_record ON archive(table_name, record_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_archive_archived_at ON archive(archived_at);
The trigger function converts the deleted row to JSON:CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION archive_on_delete()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO archive (id, table_name, record_id, data)
    VALUES (
        gen_random_uuid(),
        TG_TABLE_NAME,
        OLD.id::TEXT,
        to_jsonb(OLD)
    );
    RETURN OLD;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
Attach this trigger to any table you want to archive:CREATE TRIGGER archive_users
    BEFORE DELETE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION archive_on_delete();

CREATE TRIGGER archive_documents
    BEFORE DELETE ON documents
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION archive_on_delete();
Handling foreign key cascadesWhen a parent record is deleted, PostgreSQL cascades the delete to child records. These child deletes also fire triggers, but in the context of a cascade, you often want to know  a record was deleted.One approach is to use a session variable to track the root cause:CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION archive_on_delete()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    cause_table TEXT;
    cause_id TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Check if we're in a cascade context
    cause_table := current_setting('archive.cause_table', true);
    cause_id := current_setting('archive.cause_id', true);

    -- If this is a top-level delete, set ourselves as the cause
    IF cause_table IS NULL THEN
        PERFORM set_config('archive.cause_table', TG_TABLE_NAME, true);
        PERFORM set_config('archive.cause_id', OLD.id::TEXT, true);
        cause_table := TG_TABLE_NAME;
        cause_id := OLD.id::TEXT;
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO archive (id, table_name, record_id, data, caused_by_table, caused_by_id)
    VALUES (
        gen_random_uuid(),
        TG_TABLE_NAME,
        OLD.id::TEXT,
        to_jsonb(OLD),
        cause_table,
        cause_id
    );
    RETURN OLD;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
Now when you delete a user, you can see which archived documents were deleted because of that user:SELECT * FROM archive
WHERE caused_by_table = 'users'
AND caused_by_id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000';
Triggers add some overhead to deletes, and the archive table will grow. But:Live tables stay clean – no  columns, no dead rowsCleaning up the archive table is trivial with WHERE archived_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'.Queries don't need to filter out archived recordsApplications and migrations only deal with live dataBackups of the main tables are smallerThe archive table can even live in a separate tablespace or be partitioned by time if it grows large.PostgreSQL's write-ahead log (WAL) records every change to the database. Change data capture (CDC) tools can read the WAL and stream those changes to external systems. For archiving, you'd filter for DELETE events and write the deleted records to another datastore.Debezium is the most well-known tool for this. It connects to PostgreSQL's logical replication slot, reads changes, and publishes them to Kafka. From there, a consumer writes the data wherever you want – S3, Elasticsearch, another database, etc.PostgreSQL → Debezium → Kafka → Consumer → Archive Storage
For simpler setups, there are lighter-weight alternatives: – streams WAL changes directly to webhooks or message queues without Kafka – a PostgreSQL plugin that outputs WAL changes as JSON, which you can consume with a custom script – PostgreSQL's built-in tool for reading logical replication streamsThe main downside is operational overhead. You're running additional services that need to be monitored, maintained, and made fault-tolerant. Debezium with Kafka is a significant infrastructure investment – Kafka alone requires careful tuning and monitoring.The lighter-weight alternatives reduce this burden but shift reliability concerns to your custom code. If your consumer crashes or falls behind, you need to handle that gracefully.WAL retention and max_wal_sizeA critical configuration is  in PostgreSQL. The database retains WAL segments until all replication slots have consumed them. If your CDC consumer stops processing – due to a bug, network issue, or downstream failure – WAL segments accumulate on the primary.If this continues unchecked, the primary database can run out of disk space and crash.PostgreSQL 13+ has  to limit how much WAL a slot can retain:ALTER SYSTEM SET max_slot_wal_keep_size = '10GB';
If a slot falls too far behind, PostgreSQL invalidates it rather than filling the disk. This protects the primary but means your CDC pipeline loses data and needs to be re-synced from a snapshot.You need monitoring and alerting on replication slot lag. If a slot starts falling behind, you want to know before it becomes a crisis.Captures all changes without modifying application code or adding triggersCan stream to any destination (object storage, data warehouses, search indexes)The primary database has no additional query load – it just writes WAL as normalSignificant operational complexity, especially with Kafka-based setupsRisk to primary database stability if consumers fall behindSchema changes require careful coordination between source and consumersMore infrastructure to understand, deploy, and debugThis approach makes the most sense when you already have Kafka or similar infrastructure, or when you need to stream changes to multiple destinations beyond just archiving.This is an idea I had never considered until I wrote this post – I haven't tested this, it's just an idea.What if you kept a PostgreSQL replica (e.g. using logical replication) that just didn't process DELETE queries? Would it
effectively accumulate records and updates without conflict over time?One potential benefit of this is that the archive can be easily queried, so finding old data is simple.Would the replica have  information about deletes? Could it separate live from deleted data? Would you be able to find a record that was "deleted 2 hours ago in account 123" for a customer? Perhaps instead of ignoring DELETE queries entirely, you could have a specialized replica that transforms DELETE events into an  column.One potential pitfall here could be schema migrations – would the archive run into difficulty applying migrations over time?Another downside might be cost – running a replica and keeping all that storage could have a non-trivial cost: it costs money and has operational overhead.If I were starting a new project today and needed soft delete, I'd reach for the trigger-based approach first. It's simple to set up, keeps live tables clean, and doesn't require extra infrastructure. The archive table is easy to query when you need it, and easy to ignore when you don't.If you have thoughts, comments, feedback, shoot me an email at .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The world of Japanese snack bars</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260116-inside-the-secret-world-of-japanese-snack-bars</link><author>rmason</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:34:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By the late 1960s, women-run snack bars had proliferated nationwide. Originally, these humble neighbourhood fixtures offered little more than a counter with a few stools, a radio and a small kitchen where home-style dishes were served with whisky, beer and highballs (Japanese whisky and soda water). As Western culture increasingly poured into the nation in the 1970s and 1980s, and glitzy nightclubs and discos took over Japan's major entertainment districts, snack bars began to flourish as a quieter, more intimate alternative. They became community hubs, drawing in salarymen and regulars craving conversation, familiarity and a sense of belonging.Many "snacks" adopted a unique bottle-keep () system that still exists, where regulars purchase a bottle of whisky or (a homegrown Japanese spirit), label it and store it behind the bar for future visits. This custom turned a casual drink at the local snack into a lasting relationship.Today, it's believed that roughly 100,000 snack bars operate across Japan – which, as Igarashi noted, is more than double the number of the nation's ubiquitous  (convenience stores). A self-described "snack enthusiast", she has visited more than 1,200 snacks bars across Japan. In 2021, she started offering tours to snack bars to connect younger Japanese residents and travellers with places they either might be too intimidated to enter – or, in the case of foreigners, never knew existed."In many towns, I witnessed travellers and regulars laughing together while the mama treated everyone like a family for the night," Igarashi said. "Because of this, we created the [snack tours] as a gentle guide – [like] someone who opens the cultural door for new visitors."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Agent Skills Leaderboard</title><link>https://skills.sh/</link><author>andrewqu</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:22:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Open Agent Skills EcosystemSkills are reusable capabilities for AI agents.

We want to share a clear update directly with the Nova community.Instabridge has acquired Nova Launcher. We are a Swedish company building products that help people get online, used by millions of people worldwide.What this means right nowNova is not shutting down. Our immediate focus is simple: keep Nova stable, compatible with modern Android, and actively maintained.We also know many of you have lived through a long period of uncertainty. Nova has a strong identity and a community that still cares deeply. We take that seriously.How we will approach stewardshipOur job is not to reinvent Nova overnight. Our job is to be responsible owners.Keeping performance and customization at the coreFixing bugs and keeping pace with Android changesListening carefully before making big product decisionsWe will be reading and collecting feedback from Reddit, Play Store reviews, email, and other community channels. We will not be able to respond to every post, but we will be paying attention. For support related issues, we will share a clear contact channel shortly.Why acquire Nova Launcher?We have long admired what Nova represents: speed, customization, and user control. When we saw how much the community still cares, it was clear to us that Nova deserved a stable future with active maintenance.Will Nova still feel like Nova?Yes. Nova’s identity is the point. Performance, flexibility, and user control stay at the center of the product. Any future changes will be evaluated through that lens.Are you going to add ads?Nova needs a sustainable business model to support ongoing development and maintenance. We are exploring different options, including paid tiers and other approaches. As many of you have already anticipated, we are also evaluating ad based options for the free version.If ads are introduced, Nova Prime will remain ad free. Our guiding principles are clear: keep the experience clean and fast, avoid disruptive formats, and provide a straightforward way to keep the experience ad free.Is the goal just to keep Nova alive?No. Sustainability is not just about survival. A healthy business model allows us to invest properly in Nova over time.That investment enables deeper work on performance, more powerful customization, better long term compatibility with Android, and thoughtful features that require real engineering effort. Our ambition is for Nova to remain a launcher that power users choose because it continues to do things exceptionally well and evolves with the platform.We will move deliberately and prioritize quality over rushing features out the door.What about existing Nova Prime users?We respect everyone who has supported Nova over the years. We intend to honor existing Prime purchases, and Prime features will continue working for existing Prime users. Nova Prime will also remain ad free.What about the price of Nova Prime?Some of you noticed that the price of Nova Prime increased shortly before the app was transferred to our account. We have now changed it to 3.99 USD, effective immediately, and we apologize for the timing and the confusion it caused.As we explore a sustainable long term model, we may evaluate other pricing options or tiers. If we do, we will aim to keep it fair and communicate clearly ahead of time.Will Nova become open source?We know this matters to many of you. It is something we are actively evaluating. Open sourcing a product responsibly involves licensing, security, build tooling, contribution workflow, and trademark stewardship. We do not have a decision to share yet, but we will be transparent once we do.We will keep data collection minimal and purpose driven, and we will be clear about what is collected and why. We do not sell personal data.We are here for the long term. Trust is earned through consistent maintenance and clear communication, not big promises. We will take this step by step.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IPv6 is not insecure because it lacks a NAT</title><link>https://www.johnmaguire.me/blog/ipv6-is-not-insecure-because-it-lacks-nat/</link><author>johnmaguire</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:03:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[IPv6 is not insecure because it lacks a NATI recently saw a discussion where someone argued that IPv4 is more secure than IPv6 because “the NAT-by-default of IPv4 effectively means that I get the benefit of a default-deny security strategy.” This is a common misconception that I think is worth addressing.The fundamental issue here is conflating NAT (Network Address Translation) with security. NAT isn’t actually a security feature—it’s an address conservation mechanism that became necessary because we ran out of IPv4 addresses. (Although it is totally possible to use a NAT with IPv6 too!)NAT allows multiple devices on a home network to share a single IP address on the public Internet by rewriting the destination IP of a packet based on its destination port. It chooses a new destination IP based on the “port mappings” or “port forwards” configured by the network admin.The consequence of this is that when receiving inbound traffic to a NAT’d IP, packets with an unexpected destination port (one which has not been forwarded) will keep the destination IP of the public machine and will not be routed to another machine on the network.But the security benefits people attribute to NAT  come from the stateful firewall that’s typically bundled with NAT routers. Modern routers ship with firewall policies that deny inbound traffic by default, even when a NAT is not being used. The firewall will drop packets with an unexpected destination before even considering whether to rewrite or route the packets. For example, UniFi routers ship with these default IPv6 firewall rules:Allow Established/Related Traffic (outbound return traffic)Therefore, in order to allow unsolicited inbound traffic to any IPv6 device hosted behind the router, you must explicitly add a firewall rule to allow the traffic, whether using a NAT or not.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Without benchmarking LLMs, you&apos;re likely overpaying</title><link>https://karllorey.com/posts/without-benchmarking-llms-youre-overpaying</link><author>lorey</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:03:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I helped a friend cut his LLM API bill by 80%.He's a non-technical founder building an AI-powered business.
Like most people, he picked GPT-5 because it's the default:
You have the API set up already,
the model has solid benchmarks,
everyone uses it,
why bother?!But as usage grew, so did his bill.
$1,500/month for API calls alone.So we benchmarked his actual prompts against 100+ models
and quickly realized that while GPT-5 is a solid choice,
it almost never is the cheapest and there are always cheaper options
with comparable quality.
Figuring out which saved him thousands of dollars in the process.
Here's how we did it.The Problem: Benchmarks don't predict performance on your taskWhen picking an LLM, most people just choose a model from their favorite provider.
For me, that's Anthropic, so depending on the task, I pick Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku.
If you're sophisticated, you might check Artificial Analysis, or LM Arena,
or whatever benchmark seems relevant:
GPQA Diamond, AIME, SWE Bench, MATH 500, Humanity's Last Exam, ARC-AGI, MMLU...But let's not fool ourselves here:
none of these predict performance on your specific task.
A model that tops reasoning benchmarks might be mediocre at damage cost estimation.
Or customer support in your customers' native language.
Or data extraction via Playwright.
Or whatever you're actually building.At best, they're a rough indicator of performance.
And they do not account for costs at all.The only way to know is to test on your actual prompts.
And make a decision considering quality, cost, and latency.Building benchmarks ourselvesSo to figure this out, we built our own benchmarks.
Let me walk through one use case: customer support.Step 1: Collect real examplesWe extracted actual support chats via WHAPI.
Each chat gave us the conversation history, the customer's latest message, and the response my friend actually sent.
My friend also gave me the prompts he used manually and inside this chat tool to generate responses.
Based on this, we selected around 50 chats.
A lot with frequently asked questions, but also some edge cases where we wanted the LLM to behave in a certain way.Step 2: Define the expected outputFor each example, we used my friend's actual response as the expected output.
We also defined some ranking criteria, for example:A good answer tells the customer that this product costs 5.99 and offers to take an order right now.A good answer tells the customer that the return policy gives customers 30 days to send back the order, but that they sent their return over two months after receiving it.Step 3: Create the benchmark datasetWe now had a simple dataset:
the prompt (conversation + instructions) and the expected response.As you see, this is a generic format that could be used for all use cases.
For every prompt, you define the expected response.
If you know that a specific model works great, you can even use this to generate the response and refine if necessary.We then ran this dataset across all the LLMs we wanted to benchmark.
To make implementation as easy as possible, we chose OpenRouter to get a broad set of LLMs behind the same API.
The beauty of OpenRouter is that you can use the standard OpenAI SDK and just swap out the model name: openai  OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url=,
  api_key=,
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=,  
  messages=[{: , : }]
)
This made it trivial to benchmark all models with the same code.
Running this across 50+ models gave us a dataframe with:
prompt, expected response, and actual response per model.As you quickly realize, this is more data than you can evaluate manually.
So we needed a plan:
LLMs to the rescue, again.Step 5: Scoring with LLM-as-judgeSince manually comparing hundreds of responses is not feasible,
we used an LLM as a judge.
For each sample, we used Opus 4.5 to score how well the actual response matched the expected response on a scale of 1-10.
This is why we set very specific criteria in step 2:
The LLMs were able to score much more reliably and consistently when given concrete scoring instructions.
We also spot-checked a sample of these scores against our own judgment to make sure the judge was reliable.
For example, sometimes imprecision in the expected answer led to the "judge" model applying scores wrong.
So this was more iterative than this list suggests.
That's why we prompted for not only scores, but also the reasoning behind them.We used the same approach for his other use cases.
Prompt, expected answer, and then one answer per model along with the judge model's evaluation.Deciding on the best modelNow that we had a score to measure quality per LLM, the question was:
Which model should we choose?
In practice, you want a model that provides a balance of quality, cost, and latency.
For our customer support case, latency was important. We couldn't wait for GPT-5 that took up to a minute with enough context, even though it provided great answers.
In contrast, for our other use case, damage cost estimation, we wanted the results to be as good as possible for a reasonable cost, however long they take.This made us realize, we needed to measure both cost and latency, too.Cost: For cost, we quickly realized that simply comparing token costs is not enough:
Since response tokens (thinking + actual answer) are costlier and answers varied significantly in token count,
we decided to measure overall costs per answer and thus the average costs per use case / benchmark.Latency: Since for both of our use cases the overall time until we get a full response was the only timing-related variable we needed, we used that.
Of course, that differs for chat applications where time to first token, etc. can be essential UX, too.This finally gave us a list of models per use case with quality, cost, and latency.
To decide, it was usually enough to sort by quality and choose a somewhat cheap/fast model.In theory, there's a concept called Pareto Efficiency that can be applied:
For a formal definition, the linked Wikipedia article does a better job than me.
For the informal definition, here's my take:Given that you have a benchmark across 100 LLMs with a cost and score (let's forget latency for a second).
There's no point in comparing all 100 LLMs.
For most LLMs, you will find a model that is cheaper AND better.
This means there's no point in looking at it, as there is another one that's better in both dimensions.
Checking this for all LLMs in a benchmark,
you get a list of models that have no model that's both cheaper AND better,
the Pareto Frontier:
The best LLMs for a given price.Here's my attempt to visualize this:
I've plotted the price of a model on the x-axis
and the response quality on the y-axis.
The LLMs we benchmarked are the dots.
For all models plotted in blue
there is no model that's cheaper and better.
Connecting these gives you the Pareto frontier:
the best models for a given price.Looking at it, it also becomes obvious that looking at other models makes no sense when optimizing for quality and cost.Saving $1000 monthly by switching the modelsWith these benchmark results, we found models with comparable quality at up to 10x lower cost.
My friend chose a more conservative option that still cut costs by 5x, saving him over $1000/month.This process was painful enough that I built a tool to automate it.evalry: a tool to benchmark your use case across 300+ LLMsBenchmarking and truly finding an optimal model is more complex than we initially thought.
That's why my friend never did it, that's why I usually don't do it.
You need to (re-)build all this, integrate multiple APIs, write scoring logic, error logic, etc.
Manually testing even 5 models can quickly become a multi-hour endeavor.
And new models drop weekly. Keeping up is impossible.
The same model in a month? Half the price because some transformer wizard dropped inference costs in half.So to help my friend and anyone else with the same problem, I built Evalry.
It provides all this in one simple tool that does the heavy lifting for you:
It tests your actual prompts against 300+ models at once. Compare quality, speed, and cost side-by-side. No code required, results in seconds.I'm also planning to set up continuous monitoring. So when a better model appears, that's cheaper, faster, or higher quality for your use case, you get notified.So if you're paying for LLM APIs and have never tested alternatives on your actual prompts, you're likely overpaying.
Give Evalry a try. It takes 5 minutes to find out if there's a better model for your use case.
Or if you're short on time, find the model you're currently using and try the five models that have similar performance on average.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One</title><link>https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one</link><author>mitchbob</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:01:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Archived audio: I’m at the airport in Lagos and electricity just went off for, this is five minutes and there’s still no lights at the airport—the international airport, Lagos.Wooo! Finally we got lights. Lagos, Nigeria is one of the largest cities in the world. It’s home to over 14 million people and one of Africa’s main economic hubs. It’s the most populous city in the country with Africa’s largest GDP. However in Lagos, even basic services are unreliable.Archived audio: Everything comes to life when there’s light. When there’s no light you can literally feel handicapped. This isn’t a new problem in Lagos. An unstable power grid and political corruption make providing everyday utilities—like electricity—a struggle. In 2016, The Guardian reported on a neighborhood that went without power for five years because its residents refused to pay bribes.These kinds of challenges are not unique to Lagos or even to Nigeria. Across the developing world—from Jakarta to Kinshasa—cities are growing rapidly. New residents are pouring into cities that have neither the infrastructure nor the institutions to adequately serve them.In his 2005 book  urban theorist Mike Davis chronicled the rise of million-person cities in the developing world. He described the lives of the more than one billion people who live in the world’s slums.Booming populations of these fast-growing cities find themselves in harsh living conditions. Flooded streets. Poor ventilation. Little to no waste clearance. And few basic services.The absence of infrastructure makes life dangerous.Lack of access to sanitation and healthcare are directly responsible for high infant and maternal mortality.Communicable diseases—that have become a thing of the past elsewhere—run rampant.Despite these challenges, people across the developing world are seeking out the economic opportunities that cities provide.So, is there another way? Another avenue for people in search of a better life to access not only economic opportunities, but also stable governance and reliable institutions.In this episode, we’ll be looking at one possible solution: charter cities. Built—sometimes almost from scratch—in developing countries. These developments are outside-the-box infrastructure. Rather than reforming or building on existing cities they are new constructions often with their own economic regulations and laws. Privately backed. And focused on bringing economic growth to emerging economies. Supporters see them as a way to theoretically seed the ground for more stable institutions and improved governance.Hello and welcome to the first episode of , a podcast series from Stripe Press exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. It’s not an accident that the first episode begins in Nigeria. That’s where I was born. My family moved to the United States when I was just two months old. But growing up in Texas I often wondered: what if instead of being raised in Dallas, I grew up in Lagos, like the majority of my family? That question is part of why I’ve always been so fascinated by questions about development and specifically, about Africa’s trajectory. It’s part of my story.I’m also no stranger to the world of new cities. I used to work at the Charter Cities Institute. We’ll actually hear from the institute’s founder Mark Lutter a little later in this episode. The Institute, based in Washington D.C. is a non-profit that’s working to build the ecosystem for charter cities by developing institutional frameworks that can guide their creation.Now, before we get into the nitty gritty, I want to be really clear about some of the words we’re using in this episode. You’ve already heard me say ‘new cities’ and ‘charter cities.’ There’s a pretty broad ecosystem of new city projects. So when we’re talking about the whole landscape, I’ll use the term ‘new cities’—charter cities are just one part of that world, the part most focused on leveraging the creation of new cities for global development.So, what are charter cities and where did the idea for them come from in the first place?If you spend any amount of time talking to folks about new cities there’s one name that will keep popping up. Professor Paul Romer Paul. Romer.He’s not a household name, but he’s been one of the most influential economists in the world for the last 20 years. He’s a former Chief Economist at the World Bank and in 2018 he even won the Nobel Prize.Archived audio: Dear Professor Romer...the tools you have developed broaden the scope of economic analysis...I now ask you to receive your prizes from his Majesty the King. He’s a big deal—if you’re an economist. But that’s not why all these people mention his name. In 2009, he gave a TED Talk. Now this might not seem that exciting—an economist giving a 20 minute lecture about his new idea. In fact, if you watch the talk—it’s on YouTube—you might not walk away inspired to start a city of your own.Romer walks on stage his hair more salt than pepper and close-cropped, wearing blue jeans and a dark suit jacket over a button down shirt.He paces back and forth while he talks, a clicker in his right hand occasionally changing slides behind him. His voice is steady, not monotonous, but not an orator’s.The talk has been posted on YouTube for just over 12 years and has only a little more than 150,000 views.However, for many who saw this talk back in 2009, who were captivated by Romer’s ideas, it was an a-ha moment. Like when the Beatles first went on the Ed Sullivan show. Back in 1964 a generation of young music lovers saw four guys from Liverpool playing music on their TV and thought to themselves: maybe my friends and I can do that. Inspired by Romer’s talk, many entrepreneurs began wondering the same kind of thing—what if they could build charter cities too. So—Romer’s idea. Charter cities. New cosmopolitan growth centers that would promote economic development and connect developing countries to the rest of the global economy.Romer’s proposed cities would be more than special economic zones—areas with different economic regulations—they would also be special governance zones. Places where different laws would allow for faster economic growth thanks to better institutions.Romer imagined cities located in developing countries administered by the governments of developed countries.Now, more than 12 years after Romer’s talk, if you ask some of the people most involved with the movement what charter cities are, and what purposes they serve, you’ll get pretty different answers. I think of a charter city as a special jurisdiction that is a geographic area that has different laws and institutions from the rest of the country. And the amount of difference has to be more than a special economic zone which typically just has some tax breaks, tariff breaks, a small number of legal changes. That was Patri Friedman. He runs Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm which invests in new city projects. Their slogan: Better laws. Better lives. Oh, and if you caught that his last name is Friedman. Yeah, he’s the grandson of legendary economist Milton Friedman.He got his start in the world of new cities when he founded the Seasteading Institute. A non-profit that worked to establish autonomous communities on free-floating platforms stationed in international waters. Friedman’s interest in new cities came from his analysis of governance as a kind of product that should be subject to updates. Why do our cellphones get better every year and our governments maybe occasionally get better, maybe sometimes degrade and what I realized is that if you throw away all the morality and philosophy and say, “Okay this is an industry”, what characteristics does it have? Mark Lutter, the founder and executive director of the Charter Cities Institute has a slightly more technical definition of what constitutes a charter city. So a charter city is a new city development: a new city with better laws. Paul Romer, for example, was advocating that high-income countries such as Canada act as a guarantor in a low-income country such as Honduras. And the Charter Cities Institute moved away from this, I guess, this idea, this definition, arguing for a public-private partnership. Lutter founded the Charter Cities Institute just one year after finishing his PhD in economics. In his view, charter city developments, if and when successful, will have long term positive impacts beyond the cities themselves. Charter cities have primarily been focused on emerging markets, creating a space with new institutions. So this would be going to places like Nigeria, Zambia, Honduras and creating new city developments that allowed for people to be able to hire more easily to, resolve disputes more easily to pay taxes, to register a business, having a government that’s effective at providing public goods, and this would allow for sustained economic development over time. The Institute’s website lists some of the existing cities that they see as examples of this model—jurisdictions that improved their governance and, as a result, their economic output.Dubai. Singapore. Shenzhen. Hong Kong.These cities have all experienced astronomical growth in relatively short periods of time. The Charter Cities Institute’s website has a slideshow with before and after images of each city and information about their growth.The images that accompany these numbers are just as striking. Shenzhen in 1980 is a pastoral scene of green fields, rolling hills, and distant mountains—home to about 300,000 people. But by 2017, it is all sleek skyscrapers and glowing lights—a metropolis with a population to rival New York City. Oh, and the average yearly income increased over 10,000 percent, too.Browsing these figures. Listening to Friedman and Lutter. And hearing Romer’s optimism echoing from 2009, it’s easy to understand why so many people are so dedicated to promoting the idea of new cities.But what do these numbers really mean? Who are these cities being built by? And maybe more importantly, who are they being built for?I first met Mwiya Musokotwane on a trip to a remote island in Zambia. I was there as part of my work for the Charter Cities Institute.Mwiya’s a stoic, physically imposing guy, well over six feet tall. I’ve known him for a while now and he’s basically got two speeds: full suit and sweatsuit. He’s either in board rooms, meeting with elected officials, and giving presentations, or he’s at home being a doting dad, the kind who keeps a lot of pictures of his daughter in his pocket—and on his Instagram.He’s the co-managing partner, along with his father, of Thebe Investment Management and the founder of Nkwashi, a new charter city project in Zambia. Zambia, it’s kind of like the junction point between Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa, and like South Western Africa also. Lake Tanganyika which is the world’s second longest and second largest lake by volume is partly in Zambia. The source of the largest river in southern Africa is in Zambia so it’s at the confluence of these interesting things. Zambia’s natural resources, especially copper, made it a target for colonization. But Zambia had a distinctly different experience than its neighbors. You didn’t have very militarized colonial experience as was the case elsewhere in Kenya or in South Africa. So the British were very white glove here. I think part of that is Zambia was never really seen as a place where they were going to settle…it was seen as a resource country. The British occupied what they called “Northern Rhodesia” from the late 19th century all the way until 1964. After gaining freedom Zambia began to function as a democracy. However, within a decade of independence the country was under one-party rule. Seven years later became a single party socialist state, as was the fashion in Africa those days, and you know that was basically the beginning of a long and steady decline for the country. The economy was soon in crisis and actually contracted for decades. We ended up losing three to four times our GDP per capita over the 20 years of socialism that we experienced. And then people basically got to a point where they had enough and demanded liberal democracy again.Tamara Winter: After a series of coup attempts… Archived audio: Where the rebel officers had attempted to announce they had attempted to overthrow the government because it was corrupt. …and internal struggles in the 90s, that saw former leaders imprisoned… Archived audio Today, God is great indeed. I am out, but I’ve not been told why I was in the prison for five months and seven days.
         Zambia has once again begun the move towards a multi-party democracy. Just last fall, Hakainde Hichilema, who ran for president six times in the last 15 years, was finally elected. As recently as 2017, he too spent time in prison, accused of treason for his role in anti-corruption protests against the former president. Now, Hichilema is committed to an ambitious agenda and has already begun traveling, connecting with other world leaders…Archived audio Well it is my honor and pleasure to welcome you, Mr. President, to the White House.
         …working to ensure that democracy in Zambia will be bolstered by strong national institutions and a renewed commitment to economic development.Archived audio For us to be able to run our countries in a manner that would deliver what we may call democratic dividends.
         That’s right. Delivering accelerated economic growth development to offer opportunities to our people. I think, Vice President, that’s what will sustain democracy. That’s what will make democracy attractive. Hichilema grew up in a farming family and spent years in international business. His presidency promises a new era for Zambia, one focused on economic growth and greater stability in the government.Mwiya, who was born in the late 80s, grew up watching Zambia’s economic and governance struggles first hand.Now in his early 30s he wants his investment firm to be an engine of development not just for Zambia, but for all of Africa.This vision drives Mwiya’s interest in Nkwashi. You can hear the same far-reaching desire when he explains why he wanted to build a city in the first place. I was asking myself, “how can I apply this to fix these problems as opposed to being a bystander?” I started thinking about the resources I had available to me. It just so happened that my family owned a ranch about a half-hour drive out of Lusaka and it was large enough that something meaningful could be done there.  Mwiya mentioned Lusaka.That’s the capital city of Zambia and the largest city in the country with between two and three million residents. It’s a bit larger than Chicago and slightly smaller than Berlin. And the problems he’s talking about? Well, the city is growing fast—faster than many of its institutions can cope with. As recently as October of last year there were major blackouts across Zambia.Power isn’t the only element of infrastructure under strain in Lusaka. It’s estimated that by 2030, the city will have a shortage of three million homes.Part of Mwiya’s drive to build a new city nearby was to add another living and working hub: one that could be a home to professionals and those who want to connect more directly with the rest of the world. Nkwashi is a satellite town to Lusaka. We like to call it a knowledge city. We’re anchoring the city on institutions of learning and it’s been designed to be able to be a home to up to 100,000 people.  Those learning institutions include a 130 acre university campus and the Explorer School which provides entirely online education for primary and secondary school.Archived audio: Imagine a school without borders. A school where students and teachers come from places all around the world from Bahrain to France, from Australia to Zambia. In Zambia it is common for the children of wealthier families to be educated outside of the country, in Johannesburg or even London, where Mwiya went to school. The Explorer School also reaches across borders with students in Nigeria, India and beyond but is anchored in Nkwashi.By creating learning institutions in Zambia that are internationally connected, Mwiya hopes there will be even more reason for those seeking economic and educational advancement to stay. We’re creating these institutions that hopefully can be the engines of initial economic growth. If Explorer School and Explorer Academy are fantastically successful that then creates the natural impetus to create city number two and three and four and five. Large scale new city projects like Nkwashi sit squarely at the intersection of public and private institutions. They are often so significant in scope that they require cooperation from local and national governments, in addition to willing investors. Luckily, Mwiya was prepared to navigate both of those worlds from an early age, whether or not he was fully aware of it. I didn’t really grow up with a very boxed-in view of the world. His parents made sure of that. His father is actually one of the architects of Zambia’s financial system. He’s like a super disciplined academic type person and he’s also been a central banker and economist and policy maker. A lot of the conversations he would have would be around things to do with how to develop Zambia. How to develop Africa at large. His mother was an entrepreneur. She had her own ways of conveying similar values to us. But most of hers were more practical so I think everything I learned about business as an example, I learned from her. Growing up in a household with international business interests meant an early window into the wider world. I would go with my parents on their trips to figure out different commercial undertakings they might want to get involved in like acquiring land and stuff like that at a super young age. It created this very like, explorer type mindset in me. I think that’s stuck with me into adulthood. But Mwiya was also an introverted kid who preferred his own company. Luckily at home he was in an environment that filled him with a fierce curiosity. His parents nurtured his development—each in their own way.For example, when he was 13 his father gave him a biography of Albert Einstein. His mother? Well, she gave him The Power of Positive Thinking. You know, where my dad is taciturn, she’s more expressive. Where his interests lie in more technical facts hers are much more to do with human wellbeing. He’s taught me how to build systems and she’s taught me how to lead those systems. And now, with a project like Nkwashi, Mwiya is combining lessons from both parents. Building cities and building institutions of learning...it sits right smack on the intersection between public sector and private sector work. These projects also take a hefty dose of confidence and that ‘explorer mindset’ that Mwiya described. Like Patri Friedman and Mark Lutter, Mwiya’s interest in new cities came from his dissatisfaction with the status-quo solutions he saw being offered to the structural problems in Zambia.Without Mwiya’s imagination, the land that is now becoming Nkwashi could have been put to more mundane use. There was the possibility of just subdividing allotments and then selling those, but that also felt very boring and like, low-impact. And the possibility of building something more meaningful seemed more interesting. So we’re like, “Okay we’re going to build a city.” In the red dirt and scrub brush, Mwiya saw something possibly transformational that could reach far beyond 3,000 acres outside of Lusaka.  Right now what we have is a situation where Africans regardless of where they live in the world are treated as nominal equals. It’s one thing to be equal in the law, it’s another to be equal in the way someone regards you in their hearts. And I think that’s what places like Nkwashi represent for me. Mwyia’s clear sense of purpose in building Nkwashi is not always as easy to detect in the world of new cities. Nor is the seamless mix of public and private.That intersection can sometimes be an uncomfortable one. Remember, when Paul Romer proposed the notion of charter cities, he was clear: they would be special opportunity zones run by other governments. That idea met with almost instant backlash.   The argument is that Paul Romer’s model was too neocolonial because he would have these foreign countries come and intervene, but that when it’s private entrepreneurs because they are not bound to a particular country that it’s not neocolonial. Isabelle Simpson is a PhD candidate at McGill University studying new cities and startup societies. But obviously from the perspective of the local people it is very much neocolonialism. Discomfort over foreign governments running cities in other countries is part of what spurred changes in how new cities are discussed and planned.Patri Friedman of Pronomos Capital—who we heard from earlier—is especially interested in thinking of new models for charter city development. That idea that a charter city is operated by a foreign power that just didn’t fly at all. So today’s charter cities are overseen by the host country and often are public private partnerships with companies that will build and operate the city. But this model presents challenges of its own. The gold standard right now is the Honduran ZEDE system. In Honduras, laws were passed to seed the ground for new city developments.Archived audio: Honduras has began to create two of the twelve regions of development and employment also known as charter cities. Called the ZEDE laws, they were so controversial they created a constitutional crisis, and inspired multiple protest movements.Local suspicion towards new city projects has been common in Honduras.One project, Prospera, has had ongoing tensions with the population that lives near its borders.Prospera has also been criticized for its legal system. A board of seven arbiters, many of them not native to Honduras, oversee private disputes in the city. They are asked to make rulings over residents who may or may not speak English and who are governed by a code that has borrowed liberally from different existing sets of laws.That’s a pretty extreme example. Mark Lutter, the director of the Charter Cities Institute, who you heard from at the beginning of the podcast, has been critical of this particular aspect of Prospera.Champions of new cities do, however, speak glowingly about the possibilities of these kinds of mix-and-match legal systems, ones that allow laws to be switched out and updated like software. From Patri Friedman. What’s interesting to me from an infrastructure perspective is that modifying other kinds of infrastructure—power systems or sewer systems of a city—is very, very difficult but law is a virtual layer so it can be modified the same way you deploy new software builds. And the sources for these new software builds? They can come from almost anywhere. It’s a really, really interesting point of leverage to say can we essentially write better operating systems or copy the existing operating systems, that is, copy functional sets of laws and administrative procedures from countries that work well and bring them to other countries. To critics of the new city movement this description of governance sounds too straightforward. It is emblematic of the tendency of charter city advocates to oversimplify complex issues. Isabelle Simpson goes all the way back to the first moments of Paul Romer’s original TED talk as an example.  He begins this talk by showing an Associated Press photo of African students who are sitting under streetlights at an airport and they’re sort of bent over their textbooks.Archived audio Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
         So already I find this sort of annoying because people have this really bad habit when they want to illustrate dysfunction or chaos they use Africa.Archived audio These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don’t have any electricity at home.
         And Romer does not mention that the students are from the Republic of Guinea and the airport is the international airport there. And the year is 2007.Archived audio Let’s just pick one, for example the one in the green shirt.
         Romer then gives one of the students a fictive name, “We’re going to name him Nelson.” I bet Nelson has a cellphone.Archived audio I’ll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here’s the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology like the cell phone, but doesn’t have access to a 100 year old technology for generating electric light in the home? Now in a word the answer is rules. Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that’s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson.
         Actually the causes of electricity blackouts here are complex and a comprehensive explanation would have required Romer to address in addition to the poor tariff structures—what he says are the ‘bad rules’—he would have had to talk about the country’s weak infrastructure, issues of transmission and distribution losses, supply shortages and lack of diversity in the electricity generation mix, corruption distorting contract negotiation, and the neocolonial economic situation that thrives on extraction by foreign companies which are the ones grabbing the most electricity at the lowest price.All these complex elements, they don’t fit into Romer’s narrative about bad rules. The reason scholars like Simpson fear this simplification is because simple-sounding problems invite simple solutions that overlook necessary complexities.  If you say that you want to build a new city what is it exactly that you mean by city? Isn’t a city a political space where people with different opinions and different ambitions will come and debate and sort of try to create this better society all the time? Or are you trying to create this community of like-minded people which ultimately is just sort of a gated community? In addition to political questions about new cities, there are also cultural and historical ones. Juan Du is the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. She’s also… …the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto. In her book, she pushes back on the popular narrative about Shenzhen: that until 1979 it was a sparsely populated backwater. And after government investment and its designation as a special economic zone only then did its population and economic output explode. I think it’s important to keep in mind what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top-down policy, it was a bottom-up willingness that people wanted to go there. In her book, Du unpacks how Shenzhen’s history allowed it to rapidly transform into the megacity it is today. The centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. The incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen was built up on foundations that was already preexisting and those foundations took decades if not millennium to be built. Du also takes issue with many of the popular statistics about Shenzhen pre-1979 that feed the city-built-from-scratch narrative. People think that in 1979 it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that have 30,000, especially a sleepy one and a small one at that. Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. The population of that 2,000 village conglomerate? Closer to 300,000. And it was this preexisting network that ushered contemporary Shenzhen into being. There are so much local and indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first ten years. The willingness in the new city world to downplay this part of Shenzhen’s story in favor of a more a-historical, top-down narrative worries Du. City making is a very, very complex and difficult process. The misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch that it was a blank slate or a tabula rasa is, I think, the most dangerous misconception. That one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city.  But looking at some proposed new city projects it seems like that’s exactly what certain investors hope to do.In 2020, Hong Kong real estate developer Ivan Ko proposed a creatively named new city “Nextpolis” to be located in Ireland and populated by residents of Hong Kong who wanted to escape that city’s increasingly challenging political environment.There was also a proposal in Singapore for a floating city that could house migrant workers and move, when needed, to be near construction projects.These simple-sounding solutions point to other important questions that need to be addressed in the new city ecosystem. Like who has a say in governance. Simpson points out that many of the cities cited as examples of new city developments—Shenzhen, Dubai, Singapore—are also those with restrictive, even authoritarian, national governments. It’s very bizarre that charter cities entrepreneurs would use this very authoritarian model as their blueprint for this sort of pro-free market, pro-freedom, individual freedom developments that they’re trying to do. One of the most high profile new city projects currently under construction— Saudi Arabia’s NEOM—fits this mold.Archived audio: The contemporary city needs a full redesign. What if we removed cars? What if we got rid of streets? What if we innovated in the public space? Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of government money, this ambitious plan includes everything from automated ports, to city modules spread out over hundreds of miles of desert and connected by high-speed rail. Promotional materials make it sound almost irresistible. As one  article put it: it’s Disneyland meets Dubai.Archived audio: Through advanced manufacturing methods we will create green industries of the future with sustainability and reusability built into their DNA. Because any business destined to change the world, must also protect it. NEOM is part of Saudi Vision 2030, the flagship project of the authoritarian Saudi government of Muhammed bin Salman. It has ruthlessly targeted journalists, activists, and critics at home and abroad. Entrepreneurs who are very insistent on freedom of association, freedom of movement, freedom of speech. Their model for charter cities are authoritarian countries. Nkwashi, however, is not this kind of project. It’s being built in Zambia by someone with deep roots in the country. And it is being supported by a new administration that is committed to using economic development to build more democratic institutions.Some form of government support is crucial in creating a new city. The projects that succeed will have both government support and a significant connection to the place where they are being built.Nkwashi has that connection. Even the name of the city speaks to its Zambian roots. It means eagle and so the Zambian national bird is the fish eagle and so we decided to name the city after the national bird and we chose to name it in a language that was indigenous to the area. However, these close ties don’t mean the city and the ideas that come along with it will be instantly adopted. I think people think of us as being fairly forward-thinking and maybe a little bit crazy sometimes, but I think in a good way.  Some might view Nkwashi as ‘crazy’ but that hasn’t really harmed its popularity. And you know we sold out in like three months; that initial batch of I think 80 five-acre plots, it was. And Mwiya firmly believes in the mission behind Nkwashi—not just the city, but what it could represent. I see Nkwashi as a beta, as a proof of concept. Speaking as an African, I think one of the challenges Africa has had is we haven’t yet done really big interesting things as a continent—the kind of things where people look at them and say, “Oh wow that’s like super cool that has a lot of positive impact not just for Africa but for the world at large.” That drive to change perception is a personal one for Mwiya, shaped by experiences he had during his university years in London. At 17, he left Zambia, hopeful and a bit apprehensive. He made friends quickly and found community in the classroom. However, while in London he also experienced everyday racism. This might not sound that revelatory—a young African man encountering racism in early 2000s London.What makes these experiences so important is the way Mwiya talks about them. Running in the train station to catch the train and then policemen in the train station stop you like, “Where are you running to?” I’m in a train station, it’s obvious I’m going to catch a train. You know, it’s interactions like that where I felt like I was nominally equal. Did you catch that? Nominally equal. Mwiya uses the same words talking about these incidents as he does when describing the necessity of Nkwashi. If Nkwashi is proof of concept and other similar new cities can be built around Africa, Mwiya hopes that—in time—through the educational and institutional development they bring, the international perception of Africa and Africans can change.In the end, there are as many questions about the future of new cities now as there were twelve years ago when Romer gave his talk. Maybe even more since there are real projects being launched. I was once a die-hard evangelist for new cities, a true believer. I still see the promise in the model, but now I approach the subject with more humility. Basically I’m trying to remember how little I know about what the next decades of new city development will entail. The world of new cities is shifting all the time. There have been some major changes just in the last few weeks. Remember the ZEDE laws in Honduras? They don’t even exist any more! They were unanimously repealed by Honduras’ national congress.I’m still optimistic that some version of new cities will fit into the fabric of solutions to economic challenges. But I also recognize that, in 30 years, the actual model or models that succeed may look very different from many of the projects that have been proposed so far.In the meantime, knowing there are people like Mwiya out there, thoughtful enough to meaningfully consider the big questions facing their societies and daring enough to work on audacious solutions, gives me a lot of hope. is a production of Stripe Press.

Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee and we had editing support from Astrid Landon. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus.That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is . Welcome to  B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the first episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Juan Du. She is the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto and the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City.In our conversation she offers insights into Shenzhen’s history, explains the personal connection to the city that inspired her to spend 15 years writing a book about it, and reveals why she thinks the ‘Shenzhen Experiment,’ as she calls it, is far from over. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dean Juan Du. So we’ll start with the hardest question first. Tell me your name, your academic affiliations, and why I’m talking to you right now. The why I’m not sure if I can tell you! So, hello, my name is Juan Du, I am the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto in Canada. And I recently relocated in the last six months from Hong Kong to Toronto. So it’s nice to be speaking with you. And tell me, so you’re an architect by trade. I would love if you could tell me a little bit about your background. How did you end up writing this book? Because, well you know certainly Shenzhen’s architecture is mentioned, that isn’t really the defining feature of the book. And maybe you could tell folks what the name of your book is as well. Sure. So the book is called The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City and the book as it was published is probably the fifth evolution of it or reincarnation of it. I didn’t start out by writing such a book because I am trained in architecture. And I started out to write a more architectural book about the city and specifically about the urban villages of the city. However, as I started to uncover more and more about the urban villages, I discovered a larger story really at the story of the city and the story of China. It is a story that I think is very misunderstood. It essentially is the story of China in the last 40 years and how that is contextualized within a broader understanding of the history of China, perhaps over a few centuries. So it just became a much bigger book, perhaps not in length, but in scope, the more I researched and worked on that.One of the first reasons why I wanted to write the book is actually based in my first hand experience of planning and design projects in Shenzhen. And I came across this deep history and vibrant, overlooked, urban neighborhoods that is not present in the way that Shenzhen is typically portrayed in either national media in China and especially international media in the world. It’s usually portrayed as the city without history, the city without any important pre-urbanization culture or people of significance. And that was just very much contrary to what my own experiences and later my own research uncovered. So this is why I decided to take on this challenge of writing this book. And it was very difficult for me, precisely because I wasn’t trained particularly to write such an expansive book, but it was very much a learning journey. And with these knowledge and lessons that I’ve uncovered over a decade of research and writing, I think it does contribute back to my own discipline of architecture and urban planning and design, but also I hope it contributes to others who are interested in economics, politics, geography, environmental transformation, whether it is in the Chinese context or anywhere else in the world. For anyone who isn’t familiar, what is Shenzhen? Where is it? And maybe you can answer this now, or I can ask it again in just a little bit, why is Shenzhen such a significant city? Sure. I’ll start with the ‘where’ first, maybe. So Shenzhen is located in southern China. It’s at the southern east most tip of China, just north of a river from Hong Kong. And the river is called the Shenzhen River. And this river is the border between the city of Shenzhen and the city of Hong Kong. And it used to also be an international border that you know defined between China and colonial era Hong Kong, which was ruled by the British. So it is a very interesting location. I would also say that what’s a unique geographical feature, in addition to where it’s located, is the people via one fact: it is the only city in China’s southern region where the primary dialogue is not Cantonese, which is the southern dialogue of China. The primary dialogue in Shenzhen is Mandarin, which is a typically northern dialogue that people have used to speak everywhere in China.So this is not to say that Shenzhen is a northern city, but it really testifies to the cosmopolitan nature of the city, that it is located in the southern tip. And it has a very rich southern history of China, but it is a city of migrants from all across China. And it’s really, I would say the most diverse city in China in terms of the backgrounds of people and where they’re from geographically and perhaps also socioeconomically. And I think that for me, is what makes it a significant city. And I would say that it also makes Shenzhen the most dynamic city in China today because of that mixture, because of that diversity. And it has this extreme mixture of low tech and high tech industries, it has this extreme mixture of urban and rural cultures. It has this extreme mixture of kind of the very local regional quality of a southern city with international enterprises and international headquarters via where it is and its unique history.It’s also significant if we want to speak about numbers, it’s also significant in terms of its population number. It is a city of 20 million people, which makes it a rare mega city in the world, 20 million. But what makes it more unique is that in the 1970s, the population in Shenzhen was 300,000. So it went from 300,000 to 10 million in two decades. And then when it was 10 million in the early 2000s, everyone said, “Well, this is it. This must be it. I mean, Shenzhen has reached this potential. It’s no longer unique. It’s no longer special.” Yet, over the following decade and two decades, it continued to grow into where it is today, a city, 20 million people. And that makes it an internationally significant city because that type of population growth, not only is it unprecedented in China, it’s unprecedented in the world, anywhere, at any moment of history, in the world. I really appreciate that because you just flagged Shenzhen’s population in the '70s. I’m going to come back and ask you a question about that because when I was working at the Charter Cities Institute, I was under the impression that the population was actually 30,000, but there’s a very particular reason why you used the 300,000 number. But there were a lot of people who speak as though Shenzhen’s history began in 1979. Why was 1979 such a significant year for China more broadly? Right. So 1979 is a very significant year for both Shenzhen and China. In 1979 was the year, the city of Shenzhen was established, meaning it was formally designated as an urban unit. So prior to 1979, the region was called Bao’an county, which was a rural county in the province of Guangdong. So in 1979, it was designated on this special entity as a city of Shenzhen, but the further significance of 1979 to both Shenzhen and China is because 1979 was the year China, via the central government in Beijing, launched China’s reform and opening. It was basically the beginning of a series of economic and sociopolitical reforms that entirely pivoted China’s economy and culture onto the world stage and into the identity of what China is today, internationally.I think for anyone who perhaps do not have that particular memory or anyone who’s younger than 50, I would imagine that they would be very shocked if they’re shown images or facts about what China was like in the 1960s and '70s, including anyone who’s younger than 50 in China today. The year 1979 to launch, it was a very pivotal moment and pivotal year. It’s not to say everything was instant.1979 launched the reform and opening. 1979 established the city of Shenzhen, but the first decade of that was very rocky. It was very difficult. It was very challenging. Shenzhen was very close to being shut down multiple times, reform opening policies was close to shut down multiple times. It wasn’t until the mid 1990s, right, almost two decades after 1979, did it stabilize and the country and the city had enough confidence that this is definitely the right direction for the city and for the country. And for anybody who doesn’t already know, how did allowing Shenzhen, designating it as a special economic zone, change the city? I mean, you’ve alluded now to population growth. I’m also curious about GDP growth and more broadly how Shenzhen’s success really impacted the whole country. In 1979, what was initiated was not only the city of Shenzhen, there also was initiated a policy to create special economic zones. And in 1979, Shenzhen was one of four special economic zones that was created. So what makes Shenzhen’s beginning as a city unique is that within that year, it was both a city and a special economic zone in China. There are many conversations about special economic zones. It continued to be used almost like a miracle growth formula in the world today, especially in developing economies and cities, what it meant for China at that time for Shenzhen, at that time by special economic zone, it simply meant within the designated special economic zone of Shenzhen, which was only actually the southern half of the city of Shenzhen.But within that special economic zone that the zone and the city government had the power to create an experiment with various policies and various mechanisms that was not legal, that was not allowed and not existent outside of the zone. And I also think sociopolitical reforms and policies that were experimented with, that at the time was not possible anywhere else in China. For example, at that time, if you were not born in a particular city and had its local residency status, which is called Hukou in China, you cannot legally work in anywhere but that city. You cannot get a job, you cannot get housing, you cannot get married anywhere else, but that city. It was very much mechanism of economic and population management system in China, let’s say, that it was a planned economy. But because Shenzhen was designated as a special economic zone, in Shenzhen if you were a migrant from somewhere else, from another city, from a rural region, from a village, you could get a job.You could go to school, you could rent a home, you could get married, you could make so many decisions about your own life that at the time in China, you couldn’t. And that’s why it was significant. And I would say, that’s what attracted people to go there. So what makes it unique, it’s not only the number and the population growth. I think the question is that why did all these people go there? That’s one of the biggest, I think overlooked lessons. Shenzhen as is being discussed either as a charter city precedent or model, or as a special economic zone model. I think it’s important to keep in mind, is that what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top down policy. It was a bottom up willingness that people wanted to go there.People were not forced to go there. People were not sent to go there. People left the comfort of their home. People left the comfort of their jobs and their families to go to, at the time, I said the first decade was very difficult for Shenzhen, but people left the comfort of their home. And under a planned economy, if you had a job, you had that job for life. It may not be a job you love, but you had it. You had housing, you had a job, you had your basic social networks. Within those first decade, the type of people that the city attracted were a very unique type of people. It was people who was more adventurous, it was people who is entrepreneurial. It was people who are not satisfied with what life offered them in wherever they were. So what makes Shenzhen a really interesting case study for me is a much more closer understanding of what propels people, what would attract someone to whichever place or whichever socioeconomic costs are coming from.What would attract someone to leave everything they know, and go to this place and believe that it is a land and opportunity. And to the testament of Shenzhen, even though there has been, of course, many people who arrived in Shenzhen and couldn’t make it and left, but many more did stay, right? The fact that it started with the population 300,000, now it’s 20 million. We’re basically talking about 20 million migrants, 20 million people, because it’s only within four decades, right? New population growth. Those were born in Shenzhen is still not the majority of the 20 million. The majority of the 20 million are migrants from everywhere else. They went to Shenzhen and they were able to, despite whatever challenges of a new environment, changing policy, they were able to take root and take advantage of the various unique opportunities that the city have offered and was able to make their homes there. You went to Shenzhen, I believe in 2005, I love that the book kind of starts and ends in the same place. Forgive me if I say this wrong, in Baishizhou, what did you see when you first got to Shenzhen and why is that specific village so significant to you? I did use Baishizhou, a particular urban village, as a historical site and device to open the book and end the book. And there are personal reasons. And I think for me also intellectual reasons to want to do that. Personal reasons is that in 2005, I was working in Beijing at the time and I was flying to Shenzhen to work. And I would fly to Shenzhen once every week or every two weeks. I’d fly in in the morning and I’d leave in the last flight out, because why would I want to stay in Shenzhen, it’s a city with no history, no culture. I’m only going there on business. And then one day my meeting ran over, the city official, the urban planner that I became very good friends with decades later was driving a bit too slow, going to the airport. And I missed my flight.So the city put me up in a hotel. It was a place called Overseas Chinese Town, O-C-T, which is the nicest neighborhood in Shenzhen. It has these kind of Italian villas. It has a very famous theme park. It has these tree-lined streets and some business hotels. So I was put there to stay for the night and take my first flight out the next morning. And in the hotel room, I couldn’t sleep. So I thought maybe a walk would do it. So I started walking and got lost and walked into this incredible scene, this was probably past midnight already, of a city square with everyone full of people at midnight, full of people, cooking and eating and this outdoor market, lots of kids running around. And I described it as seeing, I think in my book rather cinematically, but it was a very cinematic experience.It was as if I discovered this new world that no one had told me about, none of the architects and planners and government officials I had met at that time in Shenzhen, because I was just starting to understand the city has ever mentioned such a place of urban villages. None of what I’ve read about the city have talked about it. So it was just this incredible thing. And then later I was to understand that Baishizhou is the city’s largest and most populous urban village. It has this incredible history that I speak about in the book, I think in one of the chapters. And I did decide to end, I believe it was the last chapter on Baishizhou as well to, in some ways to talk about what started out as a very touristic understanding of what the urban village is and what the city is.But after a decade and a half of researching and interacting and learning from the local residents and the local scholars, I start to really have a much deeper understanding. However, by, at the end of the 15 years, Baishizhou was in the process of being cleared out for demolition. So I really wanted to be able to include that part in the book to really put in some ways a sense of urgency to what I wanted to call out to attention of both the people in Shenzhen, people in China, people everywhere else is that very often what’s happening through an urbanization process of so-called urban renewal, what we are demolishing, which on the surface might cosmetically look as if it shouldn’t be there, that in fact is the very heart and engine of what made that city vibrant and important in the first place. And that, for me, I think has a certain degree of urgency and has a degree of importance to be able to share with an international audience. Your book does, I think a masterful job of pointing out many misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen, whether it’s that Shenzhen’s success should primarily be attributed to top down government, to the idea that Shenzhen before the city kind of grew to become what we know it to be today, had no one there and it was just kind of this like back woods village and the land was pretty insignificant. So I’m wondering if you could tell me what are maybe some of the sort of most jarring misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen and why was it so important to you to kind of take pains to correct them? The reason why it’s important for me to put that front and center is because I had those very same misperceptions and misconceptions of the city when I started first going there. But what’s different between myself and perhaps the greater media perhaps is that my misconceptions are very quickly dispelled by me understanding the city more, but then is to watch that those misconceptions, not only did it stay throughout the decade and half I was researching and writing the book, they actually grew, it grew in their status. And it grew in the number of people who held them, it was primarily at first just kind of a national discussion. And then it became an international, Shenzhen became an international model city.And with Shenzhen’s reputation rising in the last decade, the misconceptions also arose in their importance and impact. So I thought it was really important to outline that and to say that this is why I’m writing the book, is I wanted people to have an understanding that not only is Shenzhen not the way that is commonly being perceived. In fact, it is the exact opposite. That’s what I think is really intriguing and unfortunate to me about these misconceptions of Shenzhen, and there’s many. But I think for the purpose for the book and for the purpose of me trying to create it more succinctly and communicate them, I had outlined that there was misconceptions of time, misconceptions of people, misconceptions of purpose. So misconceptions of time, we spoke about the fact that Shenzhen was established as a city in 1979. And for the most part, we’ve been speaking about the city’s growth in the past four decades and how that paralleled or instigates, actually, the growth of China in terms of economics in the past four decades.However, if you have read my book, you understand that in the book, I take pains to research and create evidence to show that the centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. And that if we did not understand what had happened in Shenzhen in the region in China prior to 1979, there could be no understanding of why Shenzhen was created. Why there was this special economic zone. Why China launched the reform opening. And most importantly, I think I wanted to evidence and I hope it was compelling to anyone who has read the book that the incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen in the past four decades absolutely was built up on foundations that was already preexistent in the region. And those foundations took decades, if not millennium, to be built.And that if Shenzhen was what people think it was in 1979, and this is where the misconception at place is also one of the misconception is that people think that in 1979, it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that has 30,000, especially a sleepy one and small one at that. But Shenzhen was not a small sleeping fishing village. Even if we don’t look at the population statistics, Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. And this is really important to understand the region and this particular place, the people, the geography, the fact that it was a port, the fact that it had these rivers, the fact that it had all of this land, that was cultivated.So that geographic understanding is really important because the misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch, that it was a blank slate or tabula rasa is I think the most dangerous misconception that one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. So I think that really is the biggest and most dangerous misconception of Shenzhen because that’s not how it happened. And the reason why I say it’s the most dangerous misconception is that Shenzhen now has been used as a model city in the context of charter cities, in the context of new cities, in the context of special economic zones, to demonstrate that not only is it possible to grow a city from blank, to plan a city from nothing. And all you had to do is add foreign direct investment.Not only is it not that, it’s the opposite of that. There was so much local indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first 10 years. And this is really something that I’m very passionate about to advocate because I believe in the importance of cities, I even believe in charter cities as something that’s important to talk about, I believe that we can make new cities and make it livable and attractive, but we also need to understand that it’s not just add money or just add policy, there is no miracle growth in this way that it is city making. It’s a very, very complex and difficult process.And if my study of Shenzhen hopefully can evidence is that it’s really important to understand that preexisting geography of people, history, culture of that place and that we should see those existing geographies, not as something to get rid of, not as a inconvenience, not as a nuisance, but really see them as the key ingredient, the seeds, if you will, that can contribute to the success of the future new city or the future new charter city. I think a lesser understood part of Shenzhen’s kind of contribution to the world, its cultural contributions. There’s a music video that you reference. This is around the time that you’re starting to get the first music videos coming out of China and these music videos are being shot literally as the city is being constructed. And one thing you’ve taken quite a lot of care to sort of show, not tell people about, and whether it’s in your book or in your appearances since then, is the real spirit of the people in Shenzhen. Yeah. So, I think in the book, I say one evidence, the first master plan of Shenzhen was based on a anticipation of a population 1 million by 2010. And by all accounts, that was a very ambitious master plan. There are not many cities that was able to go from scratch to 1 million. It was already a very ambitious plan, top down planning, many cities who’s been planned to have city of 1 million do not have any, right. There are many ghost towns, whether in China or elsewhere, more top down planned cities fail than succeed. So the top down planning from policy, from resources, infrastructure, housing, central funding, what have you, anticipated population of 1 million by 2010. The actual population in 2010 in Shenzhen was 10 million, 10 times more than what was planned via policy and the various instruments of that, whether economic or spatial. So 90% was unanticipated bottom up, right? 90% was just, people wanted to go there.And this is where the importance of the urban village I was speaking about earlier because the city was planned with its infrastructure, whether it’s housing, schools, hospitals, restaurants, to serve a particular proportion of the population. Who made up for the 90%? The local communities, the local villages, they turned their own houses into rental housing. And then once they had rental housing, the new migrants opened up restaurants. So what’s interesting of Baishizhou is that you can walk into any street in Baishizhou, and you can, within one hour, sample food from all over China, because they’re all opened by migrants from all over China. So this is what I mean by that I think we have underestimated the powers of bottom up action and bottom up growth. And because the book is intended for a general intellectual audience, I do not put too much academic or theoretical terms in there, but that aligns with my own work, in understanding informal urbanization, informal settlements, and to understand how communities build their own housing, build their own economy, build their own social network and social systems.And I’ve come to really understand that for a city to be a healthy, vibrant, expanding city, you need both formal or top down policy and planning and governance. It’s not just, that’s not important. It’s very important without that 10%, right? Without that top down, there would’ve been no Shenzhen. But this other part, the informal growth, the informal settlements, kind of these informal networks that very much is tied into and contributed to that formal economy, that formal policy, you need that without the informal on the bottom up, there would be no Shenzhen as we understand it today, and we would not be speaking about it and I would not have written a book and it would not be cited in India and Africa, Honduras, Ireland, wherever it is around the world as a model city, right? Because that top down aspect, that kind of planning aspect is actually quite standard, but it’s this kind of how these policies, when emerged with the local population of the preexisting villages and were emerged with all of these people from all around the country, coming into this one city and all collectively believing in the possibility of the new.That is an incredible, I think, a social, psychological experiment. So, I go back to why I called my book  is because I think that it is very much an experimental city. It was set up as an experiment for China to experiment with, can you have market economy in a communist country? But I think its significance goes way beyond that. It’s an experimental city in understanding human nature. It’s an experimental city in understanding both the incredible opportunities of urbanization and rapid growth, but also the native impacts on the environment on the geography of rapid urbanization. You know, the fact that it’s the state of where it is today, of being say a mega city of between 10 million to 20 million people, it’s only in the last two decades. That makes it one of the world’s youngest cities and newest experiments.I think in the conclusion of my book, I said, “I think the Shenzhen experiment’s far from over.” So I am always very uncomfortable, even myself to make any very declarative or conclusive comments about Shenzhen, because I think we don’t really understand it yet. Despite the fact that I’ve spent these time researching into it and reading everything I can about Shenzhen and southern China, I think there’s still so many more we don’t know about the city. There’s so much more lessons to uncover. So I think this experiment continues and where the city is today and where it’s going to go, it’s an open question. It’s an absolute open question. So for me, is that there’s so much for us to learn about this city and for the knowledge and experience of the city to benefit both cities and governance and also individuals in China, in Asia, but also I think there’s a lot of lessons to offer to people from all around the world, whether they’re decision makers or they’re citizens themselves.In the book, I do highlight a number of individuals I have met. Some of them are historical figures, and some of them are common everyday people and how their own lives were impacted by the urbanization of the city. But also I wanted to show how they, as individuals contributed to the city and ultimately shaped the city. And one thing I always like to remind myself and remind everyone else, that 20 million sounds like a monolith block. It’s very common for when, especially in the American context, when we look at Chinese cities or when we look at China, we see these huge gigantic numbers and that just automatically turns apart your brain into thinking that is monolith. But I do want to highlight that it’s 20 million of individuals and it’s 20 million individuals not unlike you and I. It’s 20 million individuals who have their strengths and weaknesses, who have their own neuroses, who have their emotional baggage.And these individuals, whether they’re mayors or they’re construction workers, they have had and continue to have influences in shaping the city and that’s whether it’s in Shenzhen or elsewhere. And that ultimately is something that I really would like for, especially the English reading audience and especially the North American audience, to have a more humanistic understanding of Shenzhen, to have a more humanistic understanding of China, to have a more humanistic understanding of cities that in one country or in one city, there are so many diverse views and so many different diverse entities and that individuals, nationalities, places of residence should not be grouped in within one overarching understanding about one particular country. Imagine if that be the case in the reverse, right.Do we, as individuals, want to be defined by the overall message that came out of the U.S in the past five years? I would think not. So in the same way, I would also ask everyone to have the curiosity, to try to understand whether it’s China or India or Africa or France, to understand the nuances of these political situations, and to understand the difference between national politics and individual rights and individual dreams. is a production of Stripe Press.

Earlier this year I visited California’s Salton Sea for the first time. I went with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s a producer on this podcast, and you’ll hear from him throughout this episode. It was his first trip back in over 20 years.  It just surprised me how little has changed. But also seeing the lake itself was kind of surprising. When I was standing there the other day, it’s a no man’s land. It’s literally scenes out of Mad Max. I know we say that kind of jokingly, but you can really envision it. Since the waters of the Colorado River rushed into the Salton Basin in 1905, the lake they created has been a source of promise and conflict. Now it’s shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the country.It’s also poised to become one of the largest sources of lithium in the United States. As the world transitions from gas to electric vehicles, demand for lithium is increasing rapidly. And so is interest in the Salton Sea. The potential for investment and industry could be transformational for the area.But what will that transformation look like? What impact will lithium extraction have on local communities? And what can examining the history of the Salton Sea reveal about its present and future?Hello and welcome to  a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter.In the first episode of Beneath the Surface we looked at charter cities. New urban developments built  from scratch through financial investment and political will. In this episode we’re visiting a  different kind of place. So we’re here in Salton City. This is, I think the largest community out here around the Salton Sea. The communities that have grown near the Salton Sea are unincorporated. And include everything from off-the-grid artist communities to half-inhabited suburban developments. The fate of these communities is tied to the sea. When it was a tourist destination they felt the benefits. But that opportunity has long since dried up, along with the sea. Now, the promise of becoming a ‘lithium valley’ is bringing a wave of development that could breathe new life into the area.I mentioned my colleague Everett. Well, when we started talking about doing an episode on the history and future of Salton Sea, we found out that Everett and his family have a stake in the area. At the tail end of the Salton Sea’s resort era, his family bought some land there. Hoping, like many, that it was an up-and-coming oasis. This is the place where when I was young my parents actually bought a plot of land. We’re literally standing on this plot of land. Around it there’s a handful of homes, but for the most part it’s a bunch of empty lots out here. It is a very picturesque view. It’s like a postcard. But I imagine the closer you get to it the less photogenic it gets. You have a daughter Drew. How do you hope she experiences the Salton Sea? Do you think in her lifetime it might get, I don’t know, poppin’? I don’t know…I don’t imagine she’ll have any connection to it. I never talked about it growing up. It’s just something I totally forgot about. The more my parents are getting older and thinking they need to let go of this place the more I’m hearing about the lithium stuff. So for me it’s something that I kind of want to hold onto for a little longer and see if something happens.  In the early 20th century, major construction projects were underway across southern California. Engineers planned irrigation canal networks to bring water to arid corners of the California desert. The dream at the time was to provide water for farming to the scorching hot Imperial Valley where temperatures regularly spike well above 100 degrees. Rain rarely falls. And snow has been recorded only once in the last century.But nature had other plans.For millennia, the Colorado River had occasionally made its way into the Salton Basin, creating lakes. But in the spring and summer of 1905 multiple floods wore down and eventually broke through the canal gates. And water poured into the basin.Initial attempts to close off the flow of water failed miserably. Another flood in November swept away the hastily constructed dams of gravel and brush.For two years the water flowed. And for two years crews worked around the clock. In sweltering temperatures. Under the threat of multi million-gallon flash floods. To redirect the river. When the water was finally stopped, the newly formed Salton Sea covered over 400 square miles.The early years of the Sea were mostly quiet.Naturalists categorized the many species of birds that began to congregate on its shores. The Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge was created.During the Second World War the sea became a source for fish when German u-boats made the ocean too dangerous. The military used the sea for bombing exercises. In fact, the crew that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima flew practice missions over the Salton Sea.The sea, however, was already shrinking and becoming saltier and saltier. But this didn’t stop interest in the sea from growing during the postwar economic boom.One of the people who moved to the Salton Sea after World War II was Helen Burns. She and her family made their home on a small plot of land owned by her father. Her daughter Donna Kennedy—who was barely more than a toddler at the time—remembers those early years well. She moved us down to the Salton Sea into a trailer which had an adjacent  outhouse. And we had a standpipe where we could stand and bathe. It didn’t make any difference that we were nude because no one else was there, it was completely deserted, just us.  Living in the semi-wild meant Donna and her sister had a  childhood. We did a lot of swimming in the sea, it was very clean then. Sandy beach and very lovely. So my sister and I would just frolic in the water and the sagebrush and try to catch lizards and avoid snakes and scorpions too, we didn’t care for scorpions. Helen, however, had big dreams. She set up a makeshift stand built out of a piano box and some palm fronds. Truck drivers. Immigrants trekking up from Mexico. Occasional tourists. They all stopped by Helen’s for soda, coffee, postcards, or tubes of Salton Sea sand.Business grew. And so did the number of tourists. The Salton Sea became a destination, marketed as an inland resort—the next Palm Springs.By the 1950s the Salton Sea was the place to be. And Helen expanded to meet the demand. Basically if you wanted to have some fun you went to Helen’s. At her high point she had a marina, a boat dock, gas tanks. A campground. Besides the bar and restaurant, the motel, but I’d say by 1958 things were really moving.On 4th of July she had hell divers and people water skied across the sea and back and got trophies and wore little horns. On New Years she had icebreakers and people skied across and back. There was the Miss Salton Sea Contest, the Mr. Salton Sea Contest. There were treasure trails where people went across the desert in their dune buggies and they’d try to find all the treasures she had hidden…it was just roaring with activity. Helen even earned a new title: Queen of the Salton Sea.Helen wasn’t the only one who saw the promise of the sea in the 50s and 60s. Other entrepreneurs, sensing opportunity, hitched their fortunes to the sea. The newly formed Salton City grew and grew. Promotional videos from the time show a desert oasis, a paradise of crystalline waters and inviting beaches. The future for Salton Sea couldn’t have looked brighter.Archived audio: In an article appearing in the  April 17th, 1966, Salton City was chosen by a group of planners, architects, administrative officers, politicians, professors, and associated thinkers as one of the 24 major cities in southern California in the year 2000. By the late 1960s and early 1970s however, tourism was drying up. And so was the sea. The water level dropped so significantly and the salt level rose so much, environmental observers worried that the fish and birds that lived in and around the sea would begin to die.The lack of rainfall in the Imperial Valley meant that the sea’s main source of new water was agricultural runoff. Which brought with it pesticides. Soon birds began dying and algae bloomed in the once clear waters. Resorts closed or scraped by with reduced clientele. When powerful tropical storms ripped through the Imperial Valley in the mid-70s many packed up for good. It used to be a real nice dinner house owned by Bill and Maxine McClaren. What happened to it? They kinda split up, well, actually it’s the floods what did it. By 2000, Salton City was far from being one of southern California’s major cities as the  had predicted. In fact, its population shrank to less than 1,000.Most people who have heard of the Salton Sea are probably familiar with this era of its life - from the 70s to the present. In the popular imagination, it has existed for almost 50 years as a polluted, decaying, steadily salinating space populated either by die-hards left over from its boom years, or those looking for off-the-grid living in the surrounding desert.Less than an hour south of the sea, the unincorporated community of Slab City grew on the remains of a defunct military base. Artists, dropouts, and others seeking a life outside of mainstream society congregated in the desert in what is now affectionately referred to as “The Last Free Place in America.” When we visited Salton Sea, Everett made a trip out to The Slab and talked to some of the colorful residents.  Greetings and welcome to East Jesus! I am your mediocre half-assed tour guide. I don’t give tours. That’s Wizard.  I spend six months here and six months in India or Vietnam.Tamara Winter: If you meet him, his name makes a lot of sense. He’s got this long dusty gray beard that he’s clearly been growing for several decades and he speaks with the confidence of someone who could conjure a rabbit out of a hat. This is a sheltered workshop for the work ethic impaired. They’re not lazy. They’re work ethic impaired.  East Jesus is a massive collaborative art piece. It’s a work of over 2,000 artists. And they would come here and they’d be inspired by the art. They would create art.  It’s about 50 miles from where Everett’s family has their plot of land in Salton City. On the other side of the sea. But the environmental disaster at the sea touches both communities. As the sea evaporates in the baking desert sun, dust rises from the exposed lakebed. The wind blows all this toxicity towards San Diego and LA and Imperial County doesn’t have the money to do anything but San Diego and LA does. If it affects them, they’ll do something about it. Archived audio: Sort of fine white powdery dust sits on top of the playa…and a very small wind will blow that and…I’ve been out here at times when it looked like a snow blizzard, you couldn’t see anything.: Faced with looming environmental and human crises, the state of California has created commissions. Convened taskforces. And made multimillion—even multi—dollar promises to restore the sea. But these plans, some of which have been debated for almost two decades, have not changed the day-to-day reality for many who live in the area.Now the Salton Sea is at a crossroads. It is a potentially vast source of lithium - an essential ingredient in the batteries that power the green economy. Lithium, it’s been called “white gold” it’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas. That’s Audrey Carleton. I am an environmental journalist for Vice. I wrote this story on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote-un-quote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Leading car companies are increasing the number of electric vehicles they can produce. Tesla made headlines last fall for having a market valuation greater than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Ford, and GM . But GM’s stated transformative goals set them apart. General Motors is kind of paving the way. So, they made a first in the nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035.  General Motors plans to stop making gas powered cars by 2035… On the assembly line at this GM plant outside Detroit there are two things autoworkers…will never see again internal combustion engines, and gas tanks. Because they are like the American automaker and they’ve made this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. Right now it’s estimated that almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United states come from transportation. So it’s understandable why GM’s plans are so ambitious. And their dedication to lithium mining is so strong. They’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the EV space in doing so and in order to make that happen they’re going to need a lot of lithium so General Motors struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. Enter the Salton Sea. The US Department of Energy estimates that the sea could be the source of up to 600,000 tons of lithium. Per year. In fact, the Salton Sea is… …the largest brine source of lithium in the world. That’s Dr. Michael McKibben. He’s an Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of California Riverside. He’s also one of the authors of a recent report on energy resources—including lithium—at the Salton Sea.To understand how lithium will be extracted at Salton Sea, we first need to talk about  it’s there in the first place. That’s a journey that starts millions of years ago, and thousands of miles away.The Colorado River snakes and curves across the southwestern United States passing through parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and finally California. The waters of the river have traveled that route for millions of years slowly eating away at sandstone and sediment.It was these waters that carved out the Grand Canyon. Over millennia the river carried all of the rock and mineral it eroded away. Occasionally, when hard rains fell, or there was heavy snowmelt in the Rockies, the river waters rose. And in southern California, the river would burst its banks and the parched Imperial Valley would be filled. Temporarily.The ancient lakes that formed became central to the lives and mythologies of the native peoples who lived in the area. Quechans, Chemehuevis, Cahuillas, and Kumeyaays gathered on the lake’s shores and fished their waters.The presence of these lakes can still be seen. The largest and most recent, called Lake Cahuilla, left what are called ‘bathtub rings’, or marks on the surrounding rockfaces indicating where its waters once stopped. Repeated flooding and evaporation over thousands of years left behind sediment full of minerals and trace metals, picked up as the river rushed from the Rockies to the sea. Among those metals: lithium. A lot of lithium. Dr. Michael McKibben explains just how much. Sort of back of the envelope calculation estimates I’ve done are somewhere on the order of two million to six million metric tons of lithium. A million, or six million, of anything is a lot, but Dr. McKibben puts those numbers into perspective. You know, even if we just produce a faction of it every year we could supply all US needs for lithium and actually have enough left over to export it to other countries. That would totally reverse the situation the U.S. is in where we’re now importing over 95% of the lithium we need. Right now, most lithium is mined outside the United States. Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China are all home to robust mining operations. But it’s not just the fact that the Salton Sea is in the United States that makes it such an attractive source of lithium. It’s the way lithium can be extracted.Right now, there are two common ways lithium is mined: open-pit, and evaporation. Open-pit mining is especially common in Australia.Archived audio: It’s vast and remote here in Pilbara and rich in minerals. Pilbara: sparsely populated and full of lithium. It’s home to growing mining operations.Archived audio: A new mine has recently opened here with the aim of becoming one of the biggest lithium mines in the world. That clip is from 2018. Since then, global demand for lithium has grown. And mining operations have become more and more lucrative.Archived audio: But we do things differently here. Mining hard rock lithium. In this type of mining, lithium-rich rocks are blasted apart. Pulverized. And soaked in sulphuric acid. Places like Pilbara are the ideal location for this kind of mining. It’s a region slightly larger than Iraq, but with barely more than 60,000 residents. But the pits still leave deep scars across the land. And acid runoff contaminates water supplies.The other type of mining used to collect lithium is evaporation mining. This practice is most common in South America and involves pumping groundwater from underneath dry lake beds and salt flats into enormous evaporation ponds. For example, the ponds at the Atacama salt flat form a checkerboard that stretches almost 30 square miles.In addition to taking up a lot of land, this type of mining uses large quantities of water in areas where it is already scarce.Indigenous communities near the Atacama salt flats have lost access to water and those opposed to mining fear for the fate of local wildlife if the mining operation continues.Archived audio: Sonya Ramos believes that lithium mining is killing this desert. A growing number of Chilean scientists agree and have come to the Atacama to join her campaign to stop it. So, the irony here is clear. Mining lithium—the metal that is crucial to a global transition to clean energy, can create environmental issues of its own. Added to this is another uncomfortable reality: currently the most developed nations in the world have the highest demand for lithium. But it’s sourced from some of the poorest. As Dr. Michael McKibben notes… We’re letting all the environmental problems occur in these other countries to satisfy our need for lithium. But this is where the Salton Sea comes in. The way that lithium will be gathered from the Imperial Valley is so different from open-pit and evaporation mining that Dr. McKibben hesitates to call it mining at all.: The thing I worry about most is people understanding direct lithium extraction in the context of how lithium is mined elsewhere in the world. And that’s really our biggest challenge is we shouldn’t call it lithium mining at the Salton Sea—we should call it lithium extraction because it’s not mining in the traditional sense of the word. The process called direct lithium extraction involves using some of the green energy infrastructure already at the Salton Sea and repurposing it to collect lithium in addition to creating clean energy. There are already large scale geothermal energy projects at the Salton Sea. Everett and I saw some of them when we visited. Maybe describe we’re seeing, Tammy. Okay, well this is a geothermal plant. It’s interesting…everything looks rusted by the way…it’s a lot larger than I thought when we were first driving in. You’ve got these giant, round cylinders with scaffolding at the top I guess. They draw hot saline brine, rich in metals and minerals, to the surface. As the brine is brought up, the change in pressure causes it to boil. The steam from the brine turns turbines creating electricity. Usually the brine and the recondensed steam are pumped back into the ground so the process can begin again.Direct lithium extraction basically places a filter on this process. Using other elements to draw the lithium out of the brine after it has already been brought to the surface. Then the brine, minus some lithium, is pumped back into the ground.Geothermal electricity is created. Lithium is extracted. And the only remnants are the brine and water. The potential for geothermal energy  lithium extraction at Salton Sea is especially promising because of California’s green energy goals. : So California is now legislatively mandated to have its electrical grid be based on all renewables by 2045. And so that means we need more geothermal energy to satisfy that requirement and we need more lithium storage batteries to store electricity. This new commitment to renewables means that California is ready to invest in more geothermal energy. The state—famously situated on a fault line—has huge geothermal potential. But geothermal has long played third fiddle to wind and solar because of the high cost of building power plants. Now, as California works to decarbonize, the growth in demand for geothermal energy could provide an influx of well-paying jobs and political attention to the Imperial Valley.: The state public utilities commission just asked for 1000 megawatts more of geothermal energy and the only place that can be supplied by really is the Salton Sea geothermal field. So they may have to double or triple the number of geothermal powerplants down there over the next decade to satisfy the demand for renewable energy. This could be an avenue to even more green industry. More geothermal plants means more potential for lithium extraction. But extraction is only the first step. Currently almost 80% of lithium ion batteries are made in China. If lithium extraction at the Salton Sea is successful, it is entirely possible that the area will become the ideal location for large scale domestic battery production. All of this potential is politically attractive. Presidents from both parties have championed the idea of “energy independence” for decades.Archived audio:
       Good evening. Last January 15th I went before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign sources of energy by 1985…Archived audio:: ...technologies and more independence from foreign oil.Archived audio:
       ...there is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil. [Cheering]Archived audio: I have repeatedly called in this campaign for more energy independence for America…Archived audio:
       One of the greatest results of using hydrogen power of course will be energy independence for this nation.Archived audio:
       We are closer to energy independence than we’ve ever been before…Archived audio:
       …quote “energy independent” which is a phrase that’s thrown around… Energy independence. A political catch phrase that is so popular because it can mean, well, almost anything. Does it mean opening up protected lands for oil drilling? Expanding fracking operations? Investing in wind power and solar arrays? Well, depending on who is speaking it could be any of those. Or all of them.But the underlying desire for stable, domestic sources of energy makes a lot of sense. And as the globe transitions to green energy, the benefits of significant domestic production of lithium and lithium batteries will only grow. The question remains: will lithium extraction do what no other industry has accomplished and bring political attention and well-paying jobs to the Imperial Valley?Archived audio: Infrastructure turned this desert into productive farmland, but young people…worry that there’s no political will to help this delicate ecosystem and the families who live here. For decades the communities near the Salton Sea have heard government promises of investment. And while there is a lot of hope about what lithium extraction could mean, there is also some understandable suspicion.  Anecdotally after windy days we see a lot more asthma patients coming in. Myself and my family developed asthma while living here. Childhood asthma rates are more than twice as high in the area around the Salton Sea than in the rest of California. As the sea continues to shrink…Archived audio: This area used to be water…but now obviously it’s dry here and the shoreline is hundreds of yards in this direction. …more and more fine dust particles are exposed. And risk rises. The hope is that, through lithium extraction, not only will the area receive an economic boost, but that efforts to restore the area will also gain attention and urgency.: For a very long time the state was the number one entity working to restore the Salton Sea and to be honest with you things were going very slow. Roy Durantes is a former news producer and the founder of a group called “Saving the Salton Sea.” He’s also the director of the Salton Sea Film Festival, which gives local youth the opportunity to document their experiences of the area. : I am not an expert. I am just a concerned resident. I know some people who suffer asthma. And one of my very close friends had some asthma seizures. The playa dries, all these contaminants that have been dormant there for practically 100 years could dry up and become airborne could become dust and go into the region and into people’s lungs.  Durantes worries that the speed of the state’s response does not match the rate at which the environmental disaster is escalating. : If you look at the playa exposure. This thing, man, is drying. It’s almost like in a race to dry up and we’re in a race to stop it from drying up because we don’t want to turn this into a ghost town. But there are still open questions around what lithium extraction will mean for the Imperial Valley.One thing is certain: lithium operations will grow in coming years. Global demand is expected to rise by over 800% in the next decade. So as this new layer of energy infrastructure is being created, it’s important to ask the right questions. At the Salton Sea, an area that has seen economic and political promise come and go, all these questions are playing out in real time. As Dr. McKibben explains…: So part of the challenge to the geothermal companies and then those of us who are doing research down there is to educate the public about what’s going on and to help them understand that this is not traditional lithium mining that we’re talking about. A little bit like the L.A. Times in 1966 envisioning the area as the next Palm Springs, there is a potentially thrilling future in the making at the Salton Sea. One where lithium extraction is a success, battery factories are built, well-paying jobs flood the Imperial Valley like the Colorado River waters, and the environmental crisis at the Sea is contained. That’s a future Roy Durantes can see.: What’s important is the thousands of families who are here. The thousands of kids, the thousands of people. My hope for the area is that the Salton Sea is restored so that it becomes a place of business. A place of industry. A place of recreation. A place of economy. A lot of us are very expectant and very hopeful. We want to see something happen. We want people to bring in solutions. is a production of Stripe Press.

To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and more, visit press.stripe.comThat’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is  Welcome to  B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the second episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Audrey Carleton. She is an environmental journalist and multimedia producer who writes for Motherboard, the science and technology arm of VICE. She covers all aspects of the global transition to green energy. In our conversation she discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea. She also draws on her experience covering the oil and natural gas industries to help explain why local environmental and social justice groups have reservations about the lithium operations. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Audrey Carleton. So Audrey, why are we talking today?: So we’re talking today because a couple of months ago, General Motors, which is America’s car maker, basically, struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. For context GM made this first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, they’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the, in the EV space in doing so. And in order to make that happen, they’re gonna need a lot of lithium. So they have staked out this area with Controlled Thermal Resources in Southern California called the Salton Sea which is a really interesting place because it’s this very toxic, very salty lake. It’s, it’s just a interesting place. And there’s a lot of kind of sociopolitical dynamics going on here, but essentially the goal is to mine for lithium using existing geothermal power plants and use that lithium to create EV batteries and achieve this goal of, you know, being all electric by 2035.: So you recently wrote about Salton Sea. Tell me a little bit about that. So back in July, I wrote this story for Motherboard on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote unquote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. : So Audrey, what is the Salton Sea?: So the Salton Sea is not actually a sea. It is sort of a lake. And it’s kind of an accidental one. It was created in 1905 as kind of like an offshoot of the Colorado River. So essentially the Colorado River spilled out of its irrigation system into this one kind of reservoir in the very southern tip of California near Baja. It’s also kind of near Joshua Tree, if you’re familiar with that area. It sits around 200 feet below sea level. And it doesn’t have an outlet. So there’s, you know, water kind of flows into it from the Colorado River, but it doesn’t flow out of it. So it just kind of sits there and the way that the water level is managed is water kind of evaporates off of it.And that process leaves behind a lot of salt and a lot of minerals. So it’s become, over the years, incredibly salty, I think somewhere around 50% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. So it’s not the most habitable place for animals or people. It’s in the middle of the desert, but you know, it’s, it’s a really kind of interesting, interesting area from a social kind of demographic standpoint. I believe the last numbers I saw on unemployment in the region were around 20%. So pretty high. So, you know, I think we could call this in, in one future day, if, if this does become a real lithium hub I think it will be a place where environmental justice questions are like really at the forefront of who’s involved in the economic boon that this creates, who kind of benefits from it and who is potentially harmed. I think there are a ton, a ton of interesting questions, all kind of hovering around this area. And after I published this story for VICe, I will admit, this is probably the one story that has gotten me the most, the most response, because this is like an extremely hot button controversial issue.r: I want to get back to some of that after we set some context for folks who may not be familiar with things like what lithium even is and why Salton Sea is, is so toxic. So Audrey, what is lithium? Sure. Great question. It is an element, you might remember it from the periodic table and it is a key ingredient in lithium ion batteries. So specifically, it’s extremely conductive. What that means is it has an extra electron on its outer shell and that electron because it just has the one it wants to be moving around and glamming onto other elements and creating bonds and in bouncing around so much, it creates an electrical current. So it’s highly conductive and when it’s shoved into batteries, it makes, you know, a really strong electrical current. It’s also unbelievably flammable. So these lithium battery fires are kind of a growing issue that we’ve also been working on at VICE. It’s, it’s because it’s so conductive, it’s really hard to put out and fires kind of spread in this crazy way because this one electron just wants to glam onto other things and they can be really hard to control.That’s a little bit tangential, but you know, lithium is, it’s been called white gold. It’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas because we need batteries in order to create electric vehicles and to create battery storage. Batteries will be the key to holding onto the energy that’s generated from wind and solar. In, you know, in kind of building up that infrastructure. It’s super important. I mean, one of the main kind of counterpoints that people always say about wind and solar is, well not everywhere is windy and the sun is only out for half the day, less than that during wintertime. So how are we going to, you know, generate constant energy storage or have sort of a constant, reliable energy source if these things are not around for, if they’re only around for a short amount of time and the answer is, is batteries you generate electrical current and you store it into a battery and then that’s, you know, used for later, but we need to be creating batteries and mining for minerals or elements like lithium in order to do that.And, you know, lithium’s a crucial one and it’s got a, gotten a lot of attention, but there are other elements that have kind of been that are like essential to battery creation too. Like cobalt. But it’s sort of the big one. How is lithium mined typically? Sure. Yeah. So Lithium’s kind of an interesting element. It doesn’t exist in a pure state in the earth. That’s usually glommed on with you know, another element. So it’s often mined in this process called open-pit mining, and thisrefers to the kind of technique for mining. And that’s used also in like coal mining and mining for lots of other things, but specifically with lithium, essentially what happens is a few feet of earth is dredged up. Usually open-pit is used and with open-pit mining, this is usually done with whatever the mineral or element that is being mined is pretty close to the surface of the earth. So you just kind of just dig up some earth. A few feet, few hundred feet. And create an open space, and that will make way for the minerals that you’re looking for. This process is done with coal mining for example, this is the same process that leads to mountaintop removal which is extremely controversial and really environmentally destructive. But with lithium mining, it’s, you don’t quite have to go that deep, it often creates these sort of flats. They kinda look like salt flats. You may have seen, you know, like these aerial images of lithium mines, they’re these kind of vast greenish whiteish kind of, honestly like really beautiful looking mines. And what happens is when that earth is dredged up, it gives way for this sort of salty, muddy briney stuff that then the water is evaporated off of it. And that leaves just the minerals behind. And then those are distilled and lithium is taken from it. And this is done typically, I mean, there’s, this is sort of a new thing for the U.S., but there’s this one region in South America called the lithium triangle in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.And there’s these massive lithium mines there. And that’s sort of the process there is open-pit mining and the one consequence to this, the few consequences to this is that it’s very water intensive, it creates a fair amount of mineral waste. And, you know, the health consequences of being around open-pit mines are sort of unknown. There’s this one lithium mine in Nevada, in this region called Thacker Pass that’s gotten a lot of attention and been very, very controversial because it would sort of require doing this same process and dredging into this one mountain. And you know, I think a lot of concern around this process is valid because we just, you know, it’s relatively new, we just don’t know a ton about it. So we, it’s sort of, it’s sort of like a new frontier, like a new unknown, what, what it’s gonna, you know, what kind of consequences it’s gonna hold for the people who work in this industry and the people who live nearby it. And I am gonna jump out of order here, but I’m curious how CTR’s process differs from open-pit mining.: Yeah, sure. So, Controlled Thermal Resources has proposed a slightly different process from the typical sort of open-pit mining process. The Salton Sea is already home to a number of geothermal plants so those are power plants that take heat and steam from deep beneath the earth. It’s kind of the same heat and steam that you might see in a geyser, and it’s a renewable resource. I mean, we will always have these stores of heat underneath the earth. And you know, these geothermal mines take this up and generate energy from it and then pump that back into the earth. So it’s renewable. What CTR has proposed is taking brine as a byproduct of these power plants and extracting lithium from it, and then sending that same water back into the earth. So it’s essentially taking a byproduct of an existing energy generation process and taking a mineral out of it and then returning what was already going to be going back underground into the earth.The company has been firm that this process is less water intensive and less wasteful. And generally just kind of better for the environment than open-pit mining and requires a lot less in terms of land use. Because that’s another thing with mining is that it uses a ton of land and you know, like maybe years down the line, we’re seeing this with coal mines, at least in the infrastructure package, there’s sort of a push to reforest old coal mines and that’s possible, but it takes a lot of work. And so that’s one, one other consequence of, of traditional mining is just how much it takes in terms of land. And you know, that is land that takes a lot of work to get it back to the way that it was or if you even can get it back to the way that it was.So, you know, this process kind of takes advantage of existing infrastructure. But that said, I mean, they’re still working out the kinks of what exactly this is gonna look like and, and what they need to build and what they need to create in order for, you know, this, this lithium valley or this, they calling it ‘hell’s kitchen’. This region of California to become a real lithium mining area. They’re still kind of working out what that’s gonna look like in terms of infrastructure. So the land use question is kind of still, it’s still there. And I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but I’m going to ask it again. What companies right now are really interested in mining lithium in Salton Sea?: So General Motors is kind of the big one that’s staking its claim in this region, but California has created a commission, the Lithium Valley Commission, to kind of oversee the process and turn this area into the home of an industry. I think of it as like a second Silicon Valley, because the names are so similar, but General Motors is kind of paving the way. So they made a first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, because they’re like the American automaker and you know, they’ve made this, this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time, they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. It’s going to say, if this works, it’s going to say to other automakers, look, we can do this, here’s how you can do it as well, we can live in an electric vehicle country, you know, within, within a reasonable amount of time. And it could turn this area into a real hotbed. It could really make this part of California, like an actual lithium valley, you know? So I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens. But we’re still a couple years away from that because the deal, you know, with this one mine is still kind of being figured out.: Why is it so important to mine more and more lithium? Why is there particularly such interest right now?: Yeah. That’s a great question. So lithium is a crucial element in the creation of batteries. And batteries are going to be essential in the transition away from fossil fuels because they hold on to energy that can be, you know, kind of created at any time and they make broadly speaking, they make renewable resources more reliable and more sustainable. Wind and solar are often kind of critiqued as being unreliable resources because the sun only shines for a certain amount of time every day and the wind is not everywhere, not all parts of the world are windy, and the wind doesn’t blow all the time. It doesn’t blow at the same speed. So how can we rely on these resources?Well, the answer is with batteries. By taking that energy and storing it somewhere, we have it to use for later during periods when it’s nighttime or periods, when it’s, there’s not as much of wind as a resource, we have that energy that we can rely on. With electric vehicles specifically, what that means is that each car has a battery and that gets plugged into a charger, but the energy that that charger pulls from the grid can come from any number of resources. So it’s kind of a mix right now. It could come from oil and gas. It could come from renewables, but the goal is to transition the entire energy grid to renewables and be able to pull energy from that and store it in cars with batteries. Batteries are essential for everything for the broader kind of transition to renewables. They’re essential for cars because they eliminate the likelihood that you’re using fossil fuels to power your car, because the energy that you’re pulling and storing in that battery could come from any number of things. As long as it’s energy, it can be stored in a battery, essentially. It’s just electrical current.: Are there environmental risks to lithium mining?: I mean the main things are the land questions, the land use questions and also the water that’s required. And the waste. So those are the three big ones is that it’s this process that just requires a lot of water to generate, you know, to pull minerals out of these briney kind of flats. And it, you know, requires a ton of land. A lot of land has to be staked out to create these mines. And in, you know, like Thacker Pass that’s land that’s on the top of a mountain. It’s also land that is on and near Indigenous communities. So that’s very, you know, valuable, culturally valuable and really, really important land. It’s the water, it’s the land and it’s the waste. There’s a lot of mineral waste that’s generated in this process as well. So, you know, CTR, Controlled Thermal Resources aims to kind of cut those out of the process by just using a byproduct of existing infrastructure. But it’s also kind of a new technology that they have created.  And who lives in and around Salton Sea?: The community around the Salton Sea is fairly low income. Historically on average, there are a lot of Latino communities in that region. And this would be, if this goes well, and the jobs were given to people in this community, it would be a real boon. I think from what I gauged when I was reporting on this story there is a fair amount of distrust because there were some solar projects that went up in the region a few years ago that did not end up having the jobs go to the community. That’s sort of historically how these things go. I mean, solar’s a little bit different and renewables we’re still kind of learning, but with oil and gas projects, often what happens is, you know, a pipeline will go up or oil wells will go up, or drill rigs. And the people who work on those rigs are often not people from the community. They are people who work for the company and travel around and go from region to region. And so that’s how you sort of hear about these like abandoned or these sort of ghost oil towns in, you know, in the Permian Basin in Texas is, the industry will kind of move into a region. It will be a huge boon that helps all sectors of life. I mean, the value of everything goes up when there’s a resource like this that’s so valuable and, and becomes such a part of the economy. Everything from like haircuts to like how much your coffee costs, everybody’s just making more money for that short amount of time. But then once that resource dries up, those workers move away, they go onto a new place.That’s also how you hear about these, these sort of man camps of workers who kind of move into this region and work for a period of time and then move to the next one with their company. That’s sort of the trajectory that we’ve seen with fossil fuels. I think there’s still a lot that we’re seeing around the construction of all renewable infrastructure, including mines for elements like lithium. But I think the number one concern that anybody has when something like this pops up in their region is who’s going to be benefiting from it. And if this doesn’t become something that could lift up the community around the Salton Sea and flow cash into it and really become an economic boon for that region and the people that have lived there for decades then it’s kind of like, who’s it for?What are the consequences, what are the trade offs, what’s being sacrificed in order to make this happen? And, you know, if this mining typically is not great, I mean, mining is like kind of a dangerous, dangerous process. Coal mining we have seen comes with like countless health consequences and lithium mining is still kind of being studied, but you know, if there are harms and those harms are kind of inflicted on the people who live in that region, but at the same time, they’re not really given, you know, the local jobs then that’s like a really unfortunate trade off. That’s a really, really unfortunate situation. And it would be kind of an injustice for that to happen. Fortunately, it’s looking like that’s not going to be the process, but I think that is the fear. And so, you know, the folks that I talked to when I was reporting this story out said that people in the community hadn’t really been informed of the mines going up, but were open to being part of that. If it was something that was, that proved to be kind of a financial boon for the region. But you know, they just kind of want to have a stake in the process. And that’s why this Lithium Valley Commission is so important. It’s kind of a multi-stakeholder body. It’s got you know, folks from the company. It’s got folks from the local government in Imperial County in California. It’s got a couple of members from like local community development organizations and nonprofits on it. So it really does have a lot of different voices at the table. And you know, I think if this mine comes also with something like training programs for folks who live in the region and you know, kind of job development programs, then we could see this be something that really does benefit the whole community. But you know, that’s, I think the nuances of that are still are still being worked out. And the one government official who I spoke to in Imperial County when I was reporting this story out, said that so far, you know, I asked him like, does it seem like, you know, the voices of people who live in this region are really gonna be heard, like who has more say, you know, on this, on this panel. And he was like, well, everybody’s getting along for now, so… which is good looking out in the future, but we’ll see. I mean, there’s just any number of directions this could go.: I think a lot about the term like ‘sacrifice zone’ which is one that’s commonly used to talk about oil and gas projects. And even in Brooklyn, there was this pipeline that went up, has gone up over the last couple of years. And that term was kind of used a lot, was like you know, this region is a ‘sacrifice zone’ for this infrastructure. With pipelines it’s a little bit different because it’s kind of like, you know this infrastructure just runs through your area, but it doesn’t really create any jobs other than the jobs that are required to build it in the first place. But then once it’s built, it’s kind of built. With a mine it’s a little different because I think you know there’s a more steady kind of flow of work involved in that process.But yeah, I mean, nothing is really guaranteed and we see this all the time with fossil fuel projects where, you know, there’s been some semblance of input from a local community that for example, like really needs funding for education or really needs funding for a certain, you know, social good. And so when they get the chance to kind of tap into something like, you know, some sort of resource that’s really, really lucrative then they’ll often, you know, leaders will ultimately decide to say yes to it, but it’s a trade off. Because it does come with health consequences and then often that, that doesn’t end up panning out the jobs.There’s no commitments or no contracts that say the jobs have to go to people who live in that region. So these are kind of promises that are often made in the first kind of planning stages of a project, but aren’t ever really kept.That’s not to say that’s always what happens, but it is a very distinct possibility with any project that you know, it’s not that this trade off ends up being like the people who live here and have lived here forever, and for whom this is really their home and their community, they don’t get any of the benefits of this. In fact, they just get an influx of people from outside who come and that can lead to all kinds of things. It can lead to displacement/ I mean if we compare this to the Silicon Valley and look at the displacement that happened in Northern California as a result of that. You know, that’s a distinct possibility here. But mostly, I mean, when I think about these things, I think about the health impacts cause there’s pretty much no form of resource extraction that comes without any kind of health consequence for the people who live near it, whether that’s like air pollution in particulate matter and asthma or you know, ingesting like runoff and toxins that have leached into your waterways.Like all of these things come with consequences. And so if it were to be that the community and the Salton Sea only kind of gets those negative consequences and none of the benefits, none of the economic benefits that they’re saying, you know, they’re expressing interest in, that they’re saying that they want, then, that would be like a huge injustice. But I mean, if I’m being frank, I think it’s one that like a company like General Motors would be able to get away with because oil and gas companies have been doing this kind of thing for years. And there’s only recent attention to environmental justice as a concept. But you know, there’s nothing that would, I don’t know, I guess I’m just cynical. I think that the company would probably be able to get away with it. I don’t know if I totally disagree, you know, I hope that people will keep writing about it and talking about it. And I do wonder if the tide is turning a little bit. But yeah, I don’t, I don’t know if we have like full, like a hundred percent reason to be optimistic. I know, I’m going to wind get this down and basically just ask you one, is there anything that I, that you think is really important that I, or listeners of the podcast should know that we haven’t talked about?: I feel like we’ve covered a lot of stuff. We’ve covered a fair amount of ground. I would say, I just think this is going to be a new, massive frontier in kind of the energy transition. There are probably going to be mines popping up all over the place and other mines. I mean, this one is not as controversial, but the Thacker Pass Mine in Nevada has become like wildly controversial and sort of represents this new intense kind of question of like, what are we willing to sacrifice in order to get to a renewable economy and whether we can kind of maintain the scale of consumption that we’re at and still, you know, avert the climate crisis. Like I think that this question around lithium is so interesting from an environmental perspective, but also weirdly like a philosophical one because you know, we have certain needs that we, as a species have gotten used to having like heat and electricity and cars and the ability to travel and the ability to shop and go places and mail people things.And if we want to maintain that, we’re gonna need an energy source, but no energy source comes without consequences. So it’s kind of just about minimizing those things. And I think this is a really interesting time to be looking at this right now because it’s so new, but I think that we are only going to continue to see more mines and more protests and more lawsuits against companies that are aiming to mine. And I also really staunchly believe that if we want to see a just transition, that means that we cannot treat people and the earth in the way that the fossil fuel and the coal industry has treated people and the earth. And, you know, those processes of permitting plants and permitting drill rigs and stuff and oil wells historically have been rife with violations and like, you know, like bad things happen in oil fields every day.There is illegal dumping all the time, you know, like this is a really, really difficult space to regulate. And I think if we want, you know, our new renewable economy to not come with some of those negative things, we need to hold these companies that are leading it to account. And so I think this is gonna be just like a really interesting sign of where we’re at in terms of that to see, how the creation of these minds play, plays out. And I think it’s like a really interesting, the Lithium Valley Commission and this one community and, you know, the kind of dynamics, the political dynamics at play here are really kind of interesting litmus test of that. Absolutely. Audrey, thank you so much for this. I learned a ton. I read your article, which is fantastic, but I learned a ton in just talking with you. So I’m so grateful that you took time to chat with me. I really appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you so much. is a production of Stripe Press.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is  B-sides. The global supply chain is like an industrial ballet.An intricately choreographed dance of manufacturers, distributors, and transportation infrastructure that physically moves materials and products across the globe. However just like a ballet, when one dancer stumbles - the whole production can go sideways very quickly.Archived audio: This is what the traffic bottleneck looks like at the ports of LA and Long Beach.  In the fall of 2021, with holidays fast approaching, a record number of ships sat waiting just off of the Port of Long Beach, California, unable to unload billions worth of cargo. Fifty miles north in Malibu, the pristine coastline looked more like the area’s notoriously congested freeways. Cargo ships also stretched south, some 100 miles or so towards San Diego, not too far from the border of Mexico.Archived audio: The backup is mostly due to a surge in imports because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Online sales increased more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic, and continued to rise throughout 2021. Local lockdowns, and physical constraints on workforces, compounded the problem until, in the lead up to the holidays, it reached a breaking point.Archived audio: The complex delays at the nation’s busiest ports, accounting for 40% of the country’s container traffic, affects consumers from coast to coast. One person monitoring the situation closely was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a technology platform for global logistics. When he heard the news stories about the backlogs at California ports, he took action.He hired a boat, toured the ports, and then he took to Twitter. In 30 tweets he laid out his five-point plan to ease the bottleneck. Soon he was on the phone with California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia was implementing some of his recommendations. So how does someone end up writing what came to be known as “the tweetstorm that saved Christmas”? Welcome to  a podcast series from Stripe Press all about big ideas in infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter and today we are sitting down with Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen to understand how he thinks about trade, the way he understands the intersection of government and technology, and why he founded Flexport in the first place. We cover a lot of ground talking about everything from ancient trade routes to what Flexport is doing to help during the present crisis in Ukraine. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Ryan Petersen. This is a really long time coming. I almost feel like the hipsters, like I knew you before, my dad was reading like cover stories about you. People now know you for donating lots of money to Ukraine or saving Christmas, but some of us, some of us have been here before that. Maybe we’ll start with what is Flexport? Well, Flexport is a technology platform for global logistics. We make it possible for companies of any size to ship anything anywhere.And simply that process try to bring kind of utility grade infrastructure to an industry that’s kind of taped together by duct tape and emailed Excel files and PDF attachments and stuff. And we can make this seamless, our mission is to make global trade easy for everyone, but we want to make trade so easy there will be more trade as a result of when we’re finished. 20 years ago, I ran a small business buying products and China and selling them on the internet and was very frustrated by my experience, dealing with logistics and felt just like…George Bernard Shaw says every profession is a conspiracy against the laity.And it felt like that, like anytime I dealt with these companies, it just seemed like there was, nobody could tell me where my stuff was, how much it was gonna cost, whatever they told me, ended up costing more, a lot of really confusing paperwork, regulations, documents that were needed, data that needed to be collected and shared with the governments and stuff. And it just, nobody was there to hold my hand and make this easy for me.And it’s an industry full of code words, acronyms and Viking English, weird language is used all the time. And kind of like an all boys club, literally an all boys club, there’s lot of men working in this industry. And like, it’s very hard to parse as an outsider. When you’d ask someone to explain it to you—my working model now that I’ve kind of been on the other side is that I think that the industry treats these words, these acronyms, this lingo, as kind of a rookie detector.And it’s kind of icky. Like I want to work with companies that just want help people. And it should be a really fun industry. You get to help entrepreneurs, you get to help businesses achieve their goals, right?But it’s so important. Like we probably lifted a billion people outta poverty in the last 50 years through free market economics and adoption of global, free trading type policies around the world. And yeah, it’s like, here’s something that’s really important, interesting in my view, fun and really broken. It’s like, it’s a good heat map for where you should go work and what you could, what, where you could like build a career and do something interesting. In a word, the thing that you’re fixing is transaction costs, it’s funny. I was born in Nigeria and every time I go back, my mom’s like, “Look, if we’re at the market, don’t say anything”, because as soon as I do, it’s like, you sound like an NPR host, I’m immediately gonna charge you, you know, 40% more or whatever.  This is when you go back now? Yeah, exactly. Right. How old were you when you left Nigeria? Two months. I just want to get into, you know, you live and breathe logistics so much so that, tell me about your daughter’s Halloween costume last year. Well, my wife gets all my credit for this. We dressed my daughter, she made a wagon into a container ship, like a little radio flyer wagon, and made it into the Evergiven container ship. And we dressed my daughter like a sailor and had her drive, you know, ride around and pulled her around in that thing. And we even at some point blocked traffic with it. [laughs] But I’m sure nobody minded because it’s like this beautiful little girl just being driven around. It was super fun. Tell me about, so we talked about, why you started, how you got to starting Flexport, but I wanna go back even earlier. What was your upbringing like? How does somebody raise a child that goes on to, you know, I don’t know, save Christmas? [laughs] Saving Christmas. So my mom is an entrepreneur actually. And she’s an expert on food safety and like regulations, the intersection of food safety and government regulations. So helping companies to comply with food safety regs and, and build healthier food supply chains. I do kind of think she raised my brother and I to be entrepreneurs. We used to get our allowance by delivering sodas to her office. And like we had to sell them, we would buy the sodas at Safeway or something, sell them to her office and make, you know, make a spread. [laughs] And then that was your allowance? Yeah, that was how we got allowance. It was good money. She allowed us to overcharge her for the sodas. We’d go to Costco and buy, blow pops in bulk. And I’d sell them to all the other kids in my middle school. I don’t think at the time I was thinking about entrepreneurship, obviously, she never talked to me about that, but both my brother and I became entrepreneurs. It’s interesting how many parallels there are to different parts of the series, but the very first episode with Mwiya who is building a city in Zambia, his father was like one of the chief architects of Zambia’s finance ecosystem, but his mother was an entrepreneur.  Yeah, my mom’s a huge influence on me. My brother’s probably even more so. My brother’s a born entrepreneur too. And, when I graduated from college, I didn’t have a lot of prospects for gainful employment. I don’t know, I went to UC Berkeley. I was really interested in international development. The question of like, why are some countries poor and some countries rich?  You didn’t want to become an economist? I didn’t have the skillset for that. And then no, I didn’t wanna do like a PhD in economics. Honestly, I’m very skeptical of it all. So my brother hired me working for this trading company. Is he older or younger? My older brother, yeah. And he was a computer programmer at Intel and he was taking his salary and using it to buy stuff in China and sell it on the internet. Just like very entrepreneurial. This is, late nineties, early 2000. So there was a tech startup scene, but we weren’t part of that. It was like just a couple kids trying to make some money. And are you from Berkeley? Bethesda, Maryland. Washington DC. So this is interesting because you are sort of like right in the heart of government. And you’re in Bethesda. And for anyone who’s listening, who doesn’t know about Bethesda, Bethesda is where sort of the children of bureaucrats grow up. Well, my dad worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. My dad’s a computer programmer actually, wrote his first code that was like in production, in use in the seventies when he was working, it was actually evaluating Soviet defense. Eventually my mom started this business that does food safety and she needed software to evaluate risk of pesticides and applying like, okay, if we use this pesticide, what will happen based on the dietary data of the whole United States population? What’s the safety implications of various pesticides? And so he wrote that software. And that’s still the software that the U.S. government uses to evaluate pesticide risk assessment in the United States, is written by my father. So in some ways the marriage of government and technology or commerce is just like a very natural one for you. I’m curious about your philosophical influences. I mean, I’m hearing some like Hayek in what you’re saying. I was looking at some of the books that you recommended and I mean, they’re everywhere from  to just like interesting philosophical read. So tell me, who are the sort of intellectual influences on how you think? The thing I love about reading is like, if, if you’re reading good books, every good book you read should point you to like two or three more. I don’t think I ever really read a book by the way, cover to cover on my own until I was about 25 years old. I’m serious. I like hacked my way through college and like, you know, found the Cliff Notes or whatever.When I was 25, I was living in China and running this sort of business that would export products from China, studying Chinese in the morning and exporting products to sell in the United States.I was living there and all of a sudden books became incredibly scarce and I was kind of bored. I didn’t have that many friends. And so when, you know, there’s not a lot of English bookstores at that time. In the part of China I was living. So I would go to Hong Kong and buy like a backpack full of books and bring ’em back. And so that’s when I really became a reader. I think I read over, over like 75 books in one year that year. And it’s become a real passion of mine. The biggest influences, I think that the aha moments where I was like, whoa, this changed my worldview, probably like Richard Dawkins and reading  and understanding something about evolution and genetics.And then building from that is a book that really changed my worldview is called  Waldrop is the guy’s name. And it’s about complex adaptive systems. And this idea of feedback thresholds of complexity, when a system has enough interacting parts that at some point there’s this threshold of complexity it reaches, and it has emergent properties and it changes. So take hydrogen and oxygen. It’s pretty simple, but if you put them together, at some point you get enough of these molecules together and you got the emergent property of wetness of water, but there’s nothing about hydrogen or oxygen that if you looked at them, you would say, oh, this will—there’s wetness here. Like, no, it happens at some level of complexity when you put enough of these together. And so that was the first book that set me on that.And the one that I found that I really recommend to people, it’s not a book, it’s an Audible course called Big History. And it’s the application of complexity theory to the history of the world starting at the Big Bang all the way to the present. And then when you start to see that you can apply that in business is when it gets really fun. And that many, you know, it’s many of these things are just fascinating to watch, be able to apply an idea from one discipline to another. I think that’s where you get the most innovation is taking an idea from biology and applying it to business. Society tends to create specialists. And I really like being a generalist, understanding a little bit about everything and then you get creativity because you’re putting ideas from different disciplines that no one ever thought to combine. And my most recent inspiration has been a guy named John Boyd who’s a military strategist and talks about, how do you manage volatility and chaos, which is something that the military has to be really good at. And what is, what are the attributes of an organization that in the middle of complete chaos fog of war, what’s going on here can still take decisive action and not be caught like in survival mode and fail. And I think that’s something I’ve been trying to apply a lot at Flexport because we’re in a lot of chaos all the time. And if we can make sure we’re still playing offense, like understanding what’s happening around us and taking decisive action and then learning based on our actions.  Okay. Tell me about trade routes. Maybe you can paint a picture for me sort of about the evolution of modern logistics. Oh wow. Oh, well trade is something there’s, there’s evidence of long distance trade between human beings that far predates even things like art. Possibly predates language like 10, 50,000 or more years ago, you can, you can find evidence that humans were transporting things over a long distance. It goes for a really long time, even like the invention of the boat. The invention of the boat happened in like Mesopotamia, where what they were actually doing is transporting goods down river. And what they would do is build these wooden boats, cover them with animal skins so they could float down river and then scrap the boat, but keep the animal skins and hike back and do that over and over again. That was tens of thousands of years ago, like before agriculture, even. So this is an ancient, really ancient industry.I think you could probably date the more modern form with the age of exploration and sort of like Prince Henry, the navigator in Portugal. And actually you really wanna tie that to the Mongol invasions. So the Islamic empire kind of separated Europe from the east and they traded a lot, but the Islamic empires were in between and they were the middle man and they marked everything up like 10x and made a lot of money became rich doing that. And during the Mongol invasion, the Mongols came and defeated the caliphate in Baghdad and opened it up. And that’s where you get like Marco Polo, right, traveling to the east and kind of saw the riches of Asia and Europe for the first time was trading. And that was about a hundred year window when it was open.And then it came kind of crashing back down. The iron curtain of the Islamic empire came back and Europe was like, wait a minute. We, like, we just saw, all those riches we wanna get in on these like cheap spices and all the other stuff, the silks and everything. And so it started with the Portuguese trying to find a way around Africa and they started, this is like the original kind of like technology industry. They had to build all kinds of astronomic instruments to be able to tell where you are. It was about, I want to say 1350 is when they really started that program.And 1498 is when they rounded the horn of Africa and made it into India. Now, it’s not all beautiful. Like obviously there’s terrible things that happen. Like the first thing they did was kill a whole bunch of people who were on their way to the Hajj Islamic pilgrimage. It’s easy to kind of see yourself in these people. Especially as like a European descent person like myself, I’m like, oh yeah, I came from these people, but they were like really superstitious, very different types of people. They saw themselves in a holy war against Islam it was really, like reverse jihad crusade from the beginning. But very quickly they set up trading centers and the spices were like 1/1000th of price or something like that.Maybe, maybe that’s a bit, but it was so much cheaper if you could go to the source and not just in India, but all the way to the Spice Islands, which is, I think, modern day, the Malukus or Indonesia. And so it suddenly became very, very rich. It was kind of the original venture capital that if you sent a ship to the Malukus and it made it back, you made like eight extra money and yeah, only half the people made it back, but you still got four extra money. You know, only half the ships made it back. So that’s kind of the origin. And I think where it really comes to the next level is in the, I want to say like one of the Dutch East India Companies, the first joint stock companies, or the first public company you could buy shares in was a shipping company, the Crown of the Netherlands and later England and France to the certain extent gave monopolies on trade and in exchange for, the crown would take 20%, but then if you wanted a trade with the east, only this one company could trade.And so that was like 1700s, 1800s the East India Company, but there’s terrible things, of course: trading slaves, trading opium was big, we don’t want to pretend like all of the trade was always great and you do need regulations and there’s good reasons to have like all the rules that we have around trade today, but yeah, it’s a fascinating industry and it’s like really cool to be part of that today. Probably the most important thing, I would argue that the most important technology of the last 50 years is the shipping container. At least in terms of like lifting people out of poverty and unifying the world, creating globalization and yet, it hasn’t really changed. We still unload these ships one container at a time. It’s just like, there’s not a lot of innovation and it makes sense because it’s hard to change an organization, an institution, a way of doing things. That actually sort of beautifully dovetails into what I wanted to ask you next. You know, most people tend to think of supply chains from a consumer point of view, right? So you know, earlier this week I ordered my favorite version of Clif Bars, this is a peanut butter banana one, and you know, I press some buttons on Amazon and it comes to me. So that’s the typical way people think about supply chains, but can you talk about how the supply chain affects the economy more broadly? Well, it’s the circulatory system for the economy. The supply chain can be a lot of things. It’s also the manufacturing and things, the raw materials, there’s a great paper called I, Pencil. You know what I’m talking about? I, Pencil? I love I, Pencil. For anyone who’s not listening, the founder of FEE, the Foundation for Economic Education. It’s a great essay about trade, about how a pencil gets made called I, Pencil. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it’s basically the idea that like, there’s no human being that understands how you make a pencil and you couldn’t possibly make something simple as a pencil because you have to understand, okay, what is it made of? It’s got wood. It’s got like maybe rubber, some graphite in the middle and some kind of aluminum rapper. It’s like, okay, to make that, you need to understand how to cut down trees. Okay. How do you cut down a tree? You need a saw, okay, now I need to know metallurgy. It’s like right away, you give up. There’s no one, you know, of course there’s some people who know metallurgy, but now to make rubber, okay. I need to know how to grow rubber trees, do the little thing where they cut the slit in it, you know, capture the rubber, process it. The same for aluminum, same for graphite. And then create, I have no idea how they put the graphite inside the wood, but they have to do that too. It’s like, there’s no one who could do all of that. And then imagine that on an insane complexity of the modern economy, where everything is connected to everything else, and we all take it for granted. And that fundamentally it’s the supply chain. How does this connect to one another? How do we connect companies, people and the ideas that go into those products, right? Adam Smith has a great quote, he’s like, “I never saw a dog exchange a bone with another dog.” It’s something that only humans do.And we depend on it to an insane degree. It’s what advances civilization and progress because every time two people trade with one another, there’s a mutually beneficial exchange. And so value is created from that process. I give you something that you value more than what you gave me, I think it’s a foundational aspect of like, how we rise up as a human civilization, as a, human you know, species.I think it’s actually one of the dangerous things in globalization, is you lose kind of some of the uniqueness of different cultures and different civilizations and being uniquely good at something. Probably the most important economist, if not the most famous, is David Ricardo explained how this value creation takes place when two people trade. But if everybody has the same ideas, then all you get is like, oh, we have slightly different geographic attributes, geologic attributes, you have coal and we have timber or something. It’s not, not that interesting when all the ideas are the same. And you lose some of that if there’s cultural monotone, like all the civilizations have the same ideas. It’s not very interesting. I love to travel and I think I used to like to travel even more because the internet has kind of created a lot of monoculture. You can get avocado toast anywhere you want on planet Earth now, it’s like a sign elites are traveling in the neighborhood. I hate seeing avocado toast when I’m in some foreign country. And you know, you want to live in a world where there’s like more cultural diversity and I think it can lead to more interesting exchange of ideas and exchange of products and things.  There’s a great Verge article that I think about constantly called . And it’s all about the Airbnbification of everything. The last time I was in Zambia, I just tweeted pictures. Like, where do you think I am right now? And I got like, oh, Miami, San Francisco. And I was like, nope, I am in Lusaka, Zambia. And it looks like I’m in Miami.  Yeah. I bet you can get avocado toast there. You actually can. And you know what? The avocado toast was some of the best avocado toast I’ve ever had, I’m still thinking about that avocado toast. Alright, I’m ready to talk about Flexport. What is the problem that Flexport was created to solve? It’s fundamentally that it’s too hard to buy products in another country and import them into a different country, ship them around the world, clear them through customs, get them delivered, where they need to go. And this is for businesses, like helping a company solve this problem that they shouldn’t honestly have to have this big bureaucratic department pushing paper to do the things, it should be automatic like, companies need to be really good at two things: make an awesome product that’s high quality at scale that people want—very, very hard, almost a nightmare to do that in this world—and then even harder in my view is be differentiated, like build a brand, a customer connection, sell the product. So supply and demand, right? It’s like the core attributes of a business. And if they’re doing all this other stuff like compliance and spending time on paperwork and shipping and routing containers and tracking things like, it’s not really value added work. It should be an automatic kind of utility scale, just reliable thing that’s out there. And that’s what we, that’s what we’re building. Very, very hard problem, because if you wanna ship a single, let’s call it a pallet of goods. Yeah, I actually would love you to walk me through, you know, if I’m, if I’m the, you know, the Clif company, what actually does it take to ship this from wherever it was made now I’m kind of scared, to me in, in New York. Yeah, and so if you’re, if you’re making well, let’s say—I don’t know enough about Clif Bars, so I don’t wanna speak to, that specific company, but let’s say you’re making a pallet of some new, like cool hardware company, maybe these headphones right here. And you’re trying, they’re probably made in Shenzhen or thereabouts, in Southern China. And if you were to try to get those products made and shipped in a smaller batch, let’s take, because I want to show you it’s very normal to ship like a pallet of stuff. It should be even more normal than it is, except it’s really hard. But let’s say we’re shipping a pallet. So we’re talking about like one meter cubed of stuff that needs to ship around the world and it’s going to be—okay, how many companies are gonna be involved in this transaction? I’m shipping this from, let’s say Shenzhen to St. Louis. Alright, I’ve got a pallet of stuff and it’s going to go by ocean freight to save money—air freight’s pretty expensive. I’ve got the factory that’s gonna pick these up. So I’ve got to send a truck to pick it up, bring it to a warehouse where it’s gonna be consolidated with other customers’ cargo, put into a container. I’ve got to find a container somewhere. I’ve got to then get another truck that takes that container to the port. A customs brokerage needs to clear it out of the port, out of the country. I’m now at seven companies involved in this transaction and I haven’t left the home country yet. Seven different companies. Put it on a ship is eight, clear it through customs on the other side of the world, bring it to the port, 10 companies, another truck picks it up, brings it to a warehouse. That’s 12 companies. Another truck brings it to your final warehouse for wherever it’s destined. I’m not even like in the store yet. Oh. And by the way, there’s a bank that’s providing a payment on this transaction, maybe it’s Stripe. There’s a insurance company that’s going to underwrite in case something gets lost or damaged in the way. So I’ve got like 13, 15 companies, very normal thing to have that. And I don’t even have my headphones yet. Yeah. Your headphones haven’t got to the consumer, right. And so warehouse pick, pack and delivery. Fundamentally the problems come about because everybody in this chain is operating off of like a very local set of data of what can they see about the transaction. And yet they’re dependent on each other in a chain. Humans have to be involved in some of it. Compliance is at stake. You can’t just ship anything across international borders for good reasons. Counterfeit, drugs, arms, people, who knows what can be shipped, right? So you need these regulations. And so that’s the fundamental problem is how do we get data to the company that needs to do something, connect with that asset, with that truck, with that ship, if there’s an asset involved, show them what to do.They need data to do their job. And then they have to tell us what they’ve done and share data back. And that’s, that’s fundamentally, what’s different. We call this business a freight forwarder. That’s what we call this industry that solves this problem. Because if you’re a startup making headphones, you definitely don’t wanna be dealing with 15 companies every time you ship your pallet of headphones. So you call a freight forwarder and then a freight forwarder deals with the complexity. I often joke it should called freight email forwarding because they basically just like email everybody and make it happen. And you don’t have to deal with that. What Flexport does differently is build interfaces, web interface, mobile interface, increasingly it’s about APIs and connectivity to software talking to software so that, that data can flow to and from these parties and get visibility at what’s happening, control over what’s happening, to help smooth that transaction, make it cheaper, make it faster. Hopefully we can route around disruptions in supply chain. We can find you better routings and cheaper, faster, more options and make that process better. You have had an inside look, more so than most, into what part of the supply chain has broken down in the past couple of years, you know, there’s the like sort of evergreen headline in this, in these unprecedented times. What in the supply chain broke down? Can you just help me understand that? A lot of things, I mean, I think fundamentally what’s happened is that consumers really shifted their buying patterns rapidly overnight. When we all locked down and stop going to restaurants, hotels, bars, travel, all these things that are in the, what we call services, massages, like stuff that you just stop doing, tended to be services and we all shifted our spend onto goods. Income didn’t fall that much. A lot of people were out of work, especially if you worked in the services businesses, but the government really printed a lot of money and did a lot of stimulus. So people had money, money burns a hole in your pocket, you’ve got to spend it you know, you’ve got to get your dopamine somewhere. So people just kept buying stuff on Amazon and elsewhere, e-commerce went crazy. So you had this big shift from services onto goods and with all those goods purchases that just put incredible stress on our supply chain, manufacturing companies and couldn’t keep up. And so a lot of things kept breaking down. On logistics, it’s a simpler story. We just didn’t have enough infrastructure, not enough containers, not enough chassis—these are the trailers that haul containers—not enough drivers for the trucks, not enough container ships, the ports that we have didn’t have enough throughput to keep up with all the excess volume. So like volume of containers is up 20% over pre-pandemic levels. Things started to break down just by just not being able to keep up with the demand. I’m thinking back to when my poor dad had to sit through me and Swan Lake. I mean, if one thing goes wrong, if the Nutcracker, you know, falls, everybody falls. And, and it sounds like that is kind of a, there’s a similar level of fragility in our supply chain, which I don’t know that most people appreciated, because again, there’s a pencil right here. All you can see is, you know, the pencil that gets to you. And a lot of that complexity is just kind of hidden. Yeah. And markets work like for the most part and the price mechanisms respond. And you gotta be careful what if the price goes way up for ocean freight, which it has, it’s like up five x or so over pre pandemic levels, and there’s a lot of push right now, Congress is trying to bring it back down through regulations. We’ve got more talk about price controls than we’ve had, like in my lifetime right now. And it’s pretty dangerous because that high price is a signal to market participants. Hey, there’s money to be made. If you can bring a ship to market, if you can build a ship and that’s how markets are supposed to function. So you take out the price mechanism and you will not get more goods in response to the demand. And like, what we need is more supply, and that’s what prices are for.So when prices go up, I know a lot of government politicians, or it’s popular to say, oh, corporations are greedy, but like, maybe so, but the mechanism is price is high. Oh, wait, there’s opportunity here. And people surge onto that. And that’s, it’s amazing. It is a ballet like that. It all works. And it works because of the price mechanism basically. But it’s also amazing that it works given how screwed up humans are, like human nature is pretty screwed up. And like the fact that it all works is kind of a miracle. Like people have all, we’re kind of like beasts inside and have all these crazy emotions and terrible things, yet the economy mostly works and it’s, we can call it fragile, but it’s been relatively resilient.  Tell me about some of the misconceptions that people have about global trade. You’ve become kind of a go-to expert, like what are the sort of things people just get wrong over and over again? The idea that trade is exploitative, I think is a really interesting one. Like you have this whole fair trade movement, which I don’t quite get because trade is like mutually beneficial exchange or the idea that someone’s being exploited here, doesn’t really add up to me. I think you do need really good regulations on like externalities, like environmental damage and there’s great reason to have rules, like to protect environment, and labor safety standards and things like this, child labor and all that. But like, that’s not a trade. That’s just like good governance. The trade aspect of like one company exchanging something for money on the other side of the world, that’s like, that is the heartbeat of wealth creation, value creation, the engine of prosperity. And so to take it away, I’ve found to be really dangerous. That’s like one criticism. I think the valid criticisms that I’m very much like really interested in or the stuff I was getting to earlier on like global monoculture. Like if it’s the same product sold everywhere on planet Earth, the Earth becomes less interesting. And it’s maybe that’s like a privileged white guy thing to say, because like, I want to go to Zambia and experience like Zambian culture and like, show me what Zambia is like and make it different. Whereas Zambian people are like, look, we’re trying to be less poor. We want to have a life like you have. And who am I to say like, oh, you can’t, I don’t want you to benefit from like Western nice things. I want you to live with the way Zambains always lived in my mind. Look, I didn’t wanna say it, but I, you know, I was thinking it, but I’ll tell you what, next time I go back to Nkwashi, I’ll take you with me. You’ve touched on this a lot, but I wanna ask you explicitly, you know, there’s an inverse relationship between trade and poverty. And I’m hoping you can offer some sort of like more examples of this and expand on that point a little bit, because it’s one that I believe really strongly.  Yeah, and well, we’ve seen it over the last 50 years. I think China’s probably the best place we can point to where we lifted 600 million people or so from below the poverty line, it’s really an economic miracle. But it’s not unique to China. Korea’s a great example. Export led growth in Korea. Dubai is a more modern example where liberalization and opening things up and allowing trade to take place. I think it’s well rounded in economic theory, which I’m skeptical of, but in empirical data, you can just look and see that the countries that trade more, become more prosperous.And it’s a little dangerous in my view, there is nothing that says that all progress is up and to the right, Like we kind of think so, because we feel like we’re in a golden age and the world’s never been richer. And the graph of GDP is just like this amazing exponential curve. Four percent annual growth, but if you do it for 500 years, you get like an insane exponential curve. But that does not have to be the case. And if you look across 10,000 years of human civilization, there are these waves of progress and then collapse. And we’re right now at a crossroads where trade has not been so unpopular in a long time, you’ve got trade wars between China and the United States. You’ve got pretty much both parties in the United States, no longer supporting a free trading agenda. You’ve got war as we speak unfolding in Ukraine, which has made trade and economic sanctions into a weapon. I’m not necessarily arguing you shouldn’t do this, but we should talk about the consequences. Russia and Ukraine combined are number one and number five in grain exports. And Belarus is I think number one in fertilizer exports in potash. Take Africa over the last 40 years, Africa’s made huge amounts of progress at five x the output of food in the continent per capita over the last 40-50 years. But a lot of that’s dependent on fertilizer imports. And so if you suddenly remove all these fertilizer imports and that’s going to be even for the food sufficient nations, all of a sudden they might not be. And a lot of countries take Egypt or many Middle Eastern countries are net food importers and they buy a lot of grain from Russia and Ukraine. And if that’s removed from the market, food insecurity is what leads to civil war, famine, anarchy, right. And we’re on some level, we’re going to find out just how important globalization and trade is because we’ve taken it for granted. We’ve become incredibly dependent on it. And if you suddenly rip that carpet out, it’s almost, it’s a pretty unfair to these countries who were sold a bag like, hey, you’ll be able to get goods from anywhere. It’s very scary. I’m very worried about it. It’s really interesting because there are, you know, the first order effects that I think even those, I don’t know that they’re very well understood. But the second order effects I think are really poorly understood.  Yeah, and the second order effects, third order effects. I mean, it’s really anyone who thinks they could predict all of this. I have no idea, but very few people predicted, like realized that actually the governments really aren’t nearly as important as the people in the west and in the social media world, just reacting. And then every company feeling like, oh, we can’t do business in Russia anymore. Right? Like Coca-Cola. Even if we’re allowed to legally, we just can’t, and backing off. And that probably was not part of the calculus of like, you know, we’re not, McDonald’s is not required to shut down all their stories, but they just did. It’s like interesting, you know, 30 years ago or whatever you see, like those incredible images of the first McDonald’s opening post-Iron Curtain falling. And now, you know, McDonald’s is like pulling out. It’s just, it’s really interesting and visceral. You talk often about cargo as capital. What does that mean when you talk about cargo as capital? Well, just inventories is another form of dollars, the money has taken a different form for a period of time. I mean, that’s trade fundamentally is you’ve exchanged dollars for this other thing, which is a form of capital, working capital, inventory. I think many logistics companies and logistics companies that are buying logistics services, brands, the logistics department is not really thinking in these terms. This is classic, like finance teams think about this. Like they see it on the inventory and on the balance sheet, as you know, working capital, inventory is another line item there.But the logistics teams of the world have been trained, just like buy cheap freight as cheap as they can get the service to buy freight. They’re not really doing the math, which is not that sophisticated, but it takes one degree of sophistication more to realize that, hey, you know what, if you can ship that container 30% faster, then that’s 30% less inventory at any given moment sitting on the water, being unproductive, doing nothing useful.And so you should be willing. Now you can do the math. Are you willing to pay a premium for faster freight in order to get that cash back and reinvest it in your business in more interesting ways and put it to work? This is why, that’s one of the reasons why very high value products will ship by air. You don’t want something really, really valuable sitting on the ocean for a month. One, it might get damaged, but no, it’s more, it’s not valuable have a container load of iPhones. I’ve not done the math. Well, we could probably do the math pretty quickly. There would be probably 50,000 iPhones in a container, times a thousand bucks, each 50 million in an iPhone. I made this up. I have no idea, but I’m just doing it in my head, 50 million dollars. There’s better things Apple can do with 50 million bucks, like run some more ads and pay for air freight, which isn’t that expensive given the value of those products. So those will ship by air. There’s some degree of that, but the typical logistics team doesn’t think that way. And at Flexport, we try to get to, hey, can we help you be heroes, help you represent this data to your CFO so they can see the option like, oh, wow. I could, if I ship, if I pay a little bit more to ship it faster, I get the money back and improve my working capital situation. I want to talk about containerization, because I’ve asked you very little about that. You know, shipping containers are kind of, the heart of global trade and of the basic unit for measuring global trade. I want to know, is more generally better when it comes to containerization? Yeah. Well I think containers revolutionized trade. We probably reduced the cost of shipping things by like 95 to 99%, depending on the commodity. You see these old photographs, we have some in the Flexport office, like there’s this photographer who worked at the port of Oakland as a longshoreman and was also a photographer. And he took these beautiful pictures right at the dawn of the container era. So they have some containerization, but they also had these guys doing backbreaking work, like hauling sacks on their bag, loading the ships. And the way the ships were loaded was like, literally like tying rope to tie it all down and unbelievably laborious. And it would take a week or more to load a ship, which is not a good use of an asset. Like you’ve got to get this thing moving. It makes money when it sails.So containerization revolutionized the world and made trade possible, made it possible to buy things from around the world and find, you know, allow economic opportunity, jobs to be created and us to have cheap stuff as well. However, there’s been very little progress in that since the seventies when this took place. I don’t think the container itself needs to change form factor. It seems like basically correct. But the process by which they get loaded, unloaded from the ships, seems like there’s a lot of opportunity besides just like, pluck one container at a time off the ship. Like it would be fun to do a design contest where there’s some really creative types. Maybe you should. Yeah, conveyor belt, like PEZ dispenser out the front. I don’t know. There’s got to be some better way to do that. There’s so much talk right now about the next World’s Fair. Like bringing or World’s Fair, reviving it. I don’t know. I would love to go and see container ships. I was eating at Mission Rock and we were just watching the container ships, just one by one come through and I, it would be really cool to see like a giant robot crane. Well, the thing to watch is, is the crane up or down? What does it mean? Well, if it’s up, it’s not working and just watch they’re, they’re not down that often. Tell me, speaking of throughput is the health of global trade, is it primarily about throughput? Well from a logistics standpoint, yeah. It’s all about throughput, efficiency costs, you know, transaction costs. How do we lower the transaction costs to reduce the amount of error? Like most actual transaction costs, some of it comes from humans doing work, but I think at least within Flexport, most of the problems come about through bad quality, bad data rework, like having to redo the thing, getting the, when the data’s wrong, it can lead to, you know, a hundred x more cost. Like if you take a customs clearance, if you file with the right data, it might take you a minute to get the data organized correctly, like a minute of human labor and review the documents, we use machine learning to ingest the data off of, if it is a PDF or Excel file or something, but you still need a human to review it and validate it like for compliance reasons. So it might take you a minute. If the data’s wrong, it might take you two weeks of dealing with customs to sort it out and what went wrong.  I guess I want to know and this might be intuitive to most people, but why is it so important to have uniform standards across countries on things like shipping container dimensions? I didn’t realize that that actually wasn’t standardized until very recently. Yeah. Well, standards are crucially important for, I mean, the container’s an obvious one because if the container’s a different size, then you can’t have a standard size ship, crane, etcetera. If every container’s different, it just leads to chaos. And so that was actually created by the Federal Maritime Commission, which is a U.S. agency, created that standard. And then used that funding mechanism where if you wanted to build a ship, you basically got super cheap capital. As long as you adhered to the standard. You could build another kind of container ship, but why would you do that when like, this is the standard everyone’s using and it’s like free money if you build a ship like that. So that was one way to get a standard. It’s notoriously how hard to get everyone to agree on standards.  Well, everyone has their own opinions and you have these very boring consortiums, like I’ve never been involved in the, what do you call the web? The, HTML standard setting body that sets CSS and all these things, I would go crazy. I might have an opinion, but I can’t sit through those meetings, which is dangerous because then the standards get set by like the most boring people possible who are willing to sit through such meetings, and actually it’s a very good example is that the, the 40 foot container was not the right standard necessarily. The companies that invented the shipping container where one was using a 24 foot container and one was using a 26 foot container and for their businesses, that was like more optimal for the size and volume of the stuff that they were shipping. And there’s nothing to say that 40 foot is the right amount. In fact, I would argue it’s definitely the wrong standard because for trucks in the United States, domestic trucks, 53 foot is the length of a standard semi truck, which is really silly because we should have 53 foot ocean containers because then on every single shipment you’d have about 30% more cargo per driver per asset move.  Why is it 40? It was just set that way. It was just arbitrary? By the Federal Maritime Commission. I mean, I don’t know, I wasn’t in, in the meetings standard setting body.  So maybe it’s your fault because you weren’t in the meetings. Or like take the QWERTY keyboard. I mean, it’s notorious like not, it was set to slow you down rather than type fast. So that’s a bad standard, and yet standards are super valuable. If every keyboard was different, you could only use your own computer.I think optimizations are really important here. So for example, all the containers that we ship on average are only 70% full. Like we use, we digitize these packing lists and do the geometry of the cardboard boxes inside and see that they’re only 70% full, there’s 30% extra space right here. Okay, cool. Like you got 30% savings on carbon just by filling the container correctly. That’s not hard. So there are some easy, low hanging fruit, but fundamentally, how do you replace this? And it might be that this is one of the last holdouts where you continue to use fossil fuels, even as we go to electric fleets on cars or nuclear, hopefully nuclear power for the grid. Like you’re probably not gonna get people comfortable. There has been one nuclear power cargo ship in the history of the world, back in the sixties. I don’t think we’re ever going to go back there. What happened to it? It got decommissioned. It went for a couple of years. It was like a super fast boat. But it pre-container era. And so when the containers came along, it was retired and I think it was also pre-Chernobyl when people freaked out about nuclear. It is so interesting to me, you know, my background, I went from Bethesda to San Francisco too, then to New York. But it was always really interesting to me to observe the way that technologists interact with government. There’s your sort of Stewart Brand style person who is sort of both very interested in government and very interested in technology, but there is, I think a perception that technologists today sort of hate the government and I wonder why it is so important to you and why you have sort of gone out of your way, really to work with governments basically at this point on every level. Well it’s, our business is in clearing goods through U.S. customs. So we, you know, Flexport couldn’t exist until we got a license from the government to be able to do customs clearance and I had to go through FBI background checks, Department of Homeland Security, every customs broker does. So you know, that is our business is complying with government regulations and we don’t have a problem with the government regulations actually. I think there’s good reasons. Of course I can object to certain things. I think tariffs should be lower or have nuance and stuff like that. But like fundamentally governments have every right to control what goods flow into their country and there’s reasons, very good reasons to prevent drugs and certain kinds of weapons and yeah, illicit activity, counterfeits and stuff from crossing border. So the government plays an appropriate role and we’re happy to work with them constructively on that stuff.As a citizen, I am kind of like confused in San Francisco, why the tech community has been so disengaged with the government. I mean, like we have the board of supervisors is our version of the city council here in San Francisco. And it’s like really antagonistic to technology and to business.They just keep passing rules that are like really anti-business, new taxes, things that are just like, oh, they clearly don’t want us here. We should leave. And yet there’s 11 people on that board. I think probably seven of them are really anti-business and four more moderate and reasonably pro-business appreciate that we employ lots of people in the city and, and pay lots of taxes. So there’s seven seats and, you only need a majority or some form of majority, seven elections, each of which is decided by a couple hundred votes, We are home to some of the greatest technology platforms in the world with literally billions of users. Like we’ve managed to sign up a billion users from your website and you can’t get a hundred people to vote in an election. Like what is going on? Why are we so disengaged? I don’t have a good answer for it, I think you’ll probably start to see people wake up take action and like, look it’s, I believe deeply in democracy, but part of the democratic process is people like taking action and getting people getting out to vote. And, you know, as you look across whether it’s shipping, Flexport, what are you optimistic about? Well, you know, it’s, you have to stay optimistic about the ability for individuals to make a difference. I found over and over again in life that if you just take some action, it has a quality of its own that, can pick up the phone and call someone and make something happen, send emails, make stuff happen, and the world just kind of responds. Most recently, like we had this concept on our executive team meetings. Tuesday after the war started, we’re like, hey, we should activate flexport.org on Ukrainian relief. For people who don’t know what is flexport.org? Oh, that’s the impact arm of Flexport. We do logistics for humanitarian relief, disaster relief. It has two missions, one is carbon measurement and offsetting and mitigation and two is humanitarian relief. So this is our impact arm. Of course the executive team level we thought of, hey, let’s get flexport.org working on this. flexport.org had already been working on it for like three days. They had already lined up nonprofits and aid agencies and would take action. But we, what we said was, hey, let’s help them raise some money. I mean, there’s only so much that Flexport can do as one company to pay for very expensive humanitarian relief operations. So let’s reach out, texted a couple of people. Next thing I know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis run this like GoFundMe campaign that’s as of this moment has raised 20 million bucks for us and for airbnb.org to house refugees, us to do logistics for refugee sites.It’s like four days, we did that. And not everyone has our brand and our resources and knows how to text Ashton Kutcher or whatever, but like, you can start on a smaller level and just take some action and help somebody. And especially when you try to help someone else is when the world tries to help you, help you help them. But next thing you know, it’s a virtuous cycle and we’ve seen that with flexport.org. In fact, that was part of the reason that we set it up in a way that we can take donations is it allows us to go out and ask people to get involved, like our customers. We get them to donate products. If we can find a product that our customers make that a refugee camp needs, that’s like, what we do is we match them and we pay for the logistics, or we’ll get a donor to pay for the logistics. But like, by getting that sense of community engagement, everybody’s asked to help. People love to help. Like they want give back, they want to find these opportunities. And so I’m so very optimistic of the power of kind of, I might call it naive optimism that like, believing that you can do something, even if it’s tiny and it has a power of its own to inspire other people to do that. We live in a messed up world, but I don’t think it’s more messed up than it’s been in the past.Like there’s always been wars, since the dawn of humanity, go read the books, like there’s been much worse wars as bad as it is to say, because we’ve never had an iPhone to watch this stuff firsthand the way we do right now. But wars have gone on since the dawn of men and that is not going to change because human nature is not going to change. There’s gonna be wars in the future. And yet humans also, I think if you were to go over right now to Poland, you would see people taking care of each other people housing refugees, people looking after families. And so the bright spot of humanity is not going to change either. And there’s a lot to be optimistic about for sure. It’s like kind of crazy to recognize we all do kind of have these superpowers. It takes a long time to compound so that the world’s given me more resources and connectivity and network to get stuff done, but I think we all have that superpower a bit. And the more you use it, the more it compounds, and becomes more powerful. Like I have a couple of friends who are I might call them like obsessive phone users on like the old school, like call people. And these people have superpowers that would, you would not believe. Like the willingness, I don’t have this, but if you had it, the willingness to make 20 to a hundred phone calls per day, if you make a hundred phone calls per day in 10 years, you’ll be a billionaire. I’m certain of it. One of them called me last night. We’re flying all these goods over to Ukraine and he’s trying to get me to fill the planes full of refugees coming back. And I’m like, that’s a great idea. They’re passenger planes. So there’s empty seats. We could do that, but they need visas to come into the United States. He’s like, yeah, you’re right. Okay. And he like patches me through and calls this like world famous venture capitalist while I’m on the line, gets him on the phone, is like, “Hey, can you help us get visas for refugees coming to the country?” He’s like, “I don’t know why you would think that I could help you with that. But like, let me see, I’ll email the government,” and like next thing, you know, like emailing senators and like I have no idea if that’ll happen or not, probably not, but like I’ve seen crazier plans work and it’s just like the willingness, energy to go try stuff, like make it work. And then you keep trying it and it compounds so, a bit like that. With my kind of port tour tweet or, you know, I’ve just been trying stuff like this for a long time and finding out like, oh wow. It can, like, you can actually have a big impact out there if you, if you’re willing to look stupid sometimes and just go for it. So that was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport. I don’t think there’s a lot more to say after that other than maybe we should all be making a few more phone calls?In the meantime, I hope you will join us for the next episode of . We’ll be looking at a type of infrastructure that has acutely felt the impacts of COVID-era supply chain disruptions: housing. We’ll travel to London and visit with a Haredi Jewish community that has fought to upzone their houses so they can have room for their large families. is a production of Stripe Press.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is . It’s March the 15th. Half past one in the afternoon and I’m standing on a residential street in South Tottenham, which is in Haringey, a borough of North London. That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood. He’s out on the streets of London to look at houses. So the buildings we have here are two-story terraced Victorian and Edwardian homes. I can see many of them have cornices under their eaves or bay windows, gables… And he’s looking at these houses here because many of them are beginning to change. This residential street’s not quite like every residential street in the country because in addition to its normal two-story Victorian terraced homes, there are additional extensions that have been put on many of these houses. They have been built directly upwards, completely in keeping with the existing Victorian facade. In fact, I’m standing directly opposite an extension going on right now. Victorian houses in the UK were built during the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. People from across the country flocked to London just as the industrial revolution was picking up speed. From 1811 to 1851, the population of Greater London doubled, half of the country’s population called the city home. A lot of new housing was needed and fast. And today, many of these Victorian houses are still in use. But now, London faces a new housing crisis: unaffordable rents, overcrowded conditions, and the dream of home ownership drifting further away from the city’s young people. London isn’t alone here. A similar story is happening around the world in cities large and small.However, on that quiet residential street in South Tottenham, the story behind those extensions offers a lesson for those tackling the global housing crisis.Hello and welcome to , a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter.In our previous episode, we looked at supply chains: the movement of materials and products from country to country and a delicate dance that makes up the global economy. Today, we’re looking at a component of infrastructure that by its very nature doesn’t move: housing. The issues around housing are diverse and wide ranging. Whether the locality in question is a small town or global metropolis, every place has its own unique challenges. Still, once you dig a little deeper, you start to see some common threads. In this episode, we’ll explore why housing prices have risen dramatically in so many places and how individual neighborhoods, like South Tottenham in London, can address these challenges. For most of human history, people lived in rural areas. But over the last two centuries, cities around the world have seen explosive growth. The UN estimates that 2007 was the first year that most people lived in urban areas and the urban population is expected to double by 2050. This means that cities are having to adapt in unprecedented ways. How do we deliver food and other goods? How do we move through and between cities? And where are all of these new urban dwellers going to live? Because right now, the increase in population is leading to a housing shortage. The supply of homes in most cities has not kept up with the demand, unless supply means prices naturally go up.Archived audio: We’ve seen house prices go up steadily by several thousand…Archived audio Housing prices in Ireland rising by a hundred euro a day.Archived audio: Housing costs taking a bigger bite out of your paycheck and it doesn’t seem to be any relief in sight. I would say that affordability in US cities is the biggest challenge right now. This is Emily Hamilton. She was at the top of my list of people I wanted to talk to for this episode on housing. I’m a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. She says the most relevant housing challenge across the country and really across the world is affordability. Several decades ago, urban policy makers were much more concerned about having too many residents leaving cities and issues like vacancy and crime were much more relevant than affordability. But today, as cities have become job centers once again and are generally the location where the highest paying jobs in the US are located, it’s become much more of a question of how to make space for everyone who would like to live in cities and be able to access those job markets at prices that are affordable to them. And in many parts of the world, that holds true as well, particularly English speaking parts of the world, like the UK and Canada, are facing very similar affordability challenges to the US. I’ll admit that I’m a statistic on this trend as well. Since graduating from college in 2017, I’ve lived in some of the most expensive cities in the US: Washington DC, San Francisco, and now, New York. From 1980 to 2020, housing prices in the New York metropolitan area have gone up 700%, more than double wage growth during that same period. In other words, an apartment that sold for $200,000 in 1980 would’ve sold for $1.4 million in 2020. In San Francisco, house prices went up over 900%, and cities outside the US have seen equally dramatic numbers. Ireland saw prices rise by about 800% driven primarily by Dublin. Prices in Sydney, Australia were up almost 1,500%. And in London, the average home price in 1980 was about 25,000 pounds. In 2020, the average price was about 490,000 pounds, a nearly 2,000% increase. Well, the UK, and the UK isn’t alone here, has a shortage of housing around its most successful, big cities. That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood, again. He’s currently an editor for the online magazine, Works in Progress, but he’s been studying housing for a long time. I worked in housing policy for much of the last five years, including at Create Streets, Policy Exchange, and the Adam Smith Institute. I’m obsessed with housing. In the morning, I wake up thinking, "How are we going to solve the housing problems in the UK today?" And I go to bed in the evening, also, still thinking about how are we going to solve the problems in the UK has with housing.And this shortage of housing has led to massive increases in the price of that housing either to buy or to rent and also big shortages and long waiting lists for government-provided housing. Ben is always thinking about unique solutions to the housing crisis. So when he came across a series of interesting building renovations happening in North London, he had to investigate. Most of the time in England, when you do upwards extensions on homes, those extensions look very different to the house underneath and often are very ugly. And often, therefore, neighbors oppose them very vociferously. However, this extension, interestingly, was identical to the building underneath. In fact, it looked as if they had cut off the roof, added an identical story, and then plopped the roof back on top again. So Ben did what any good researcher would do these days: he took the question to Twitter. A councilor from North London, that is someone who had been elected by the local residents to be on the council—council is just the standard form of local government in the UK—replied to our Twitter threads, telling us what happened. The councilor revealed that the people of this community had a particular need for these housing extensions because they were Haredi Jews.Archived audio: Two hundred boys and girls waved a greeting to England, land of the free, the advanced guard of the first 5,000 Jewish and non-Aryan child refugees from Germany will be provided with a temporary home here while arrangements are made for them to immigrate. Haredi Jews first established themselves in London in the 1920s. However, it was after the second World War that the area really started to take off as Jewish refugees fled the Holocaust. Haredi Jews tend to be stricter in their practice of Orthodox Judaism than their peers. They adhere to kosher diets, go to synagogue several times a day, and send their children to religious schools. They also observe Shabbat on Saturdays, meaning, they don’t drive or use electricity. All of these cultural factors mean that Haredi Jewish people tend to live in tight knit and compact communities.One area they settled in was Stamford Hill. It’s in a borough of Hackney in North London. Today, it is the largest strictly Orthodox Jewish community in all of Europe. Add to that, the large size of Haredi families and the result has been overcrowded housing conditions. So yet another neighborhood in North London sprung up as a hub for the Haredi community, South Tottenham in the borough of Haringey. By one estimate, the number of Haredi families has increased fivefold in the last several decades. That’s where Ben found himself, investigating housing extensions. Hi there. I’m standing in South Tottenham, which is a neighborhood in North London looking around a suburban street. I have two-story Victorian homes. It’s quite quiet. I can see a few people walking down every few minutes. I can see lots of people walking around in Orthodox Jewish clothing. And I’m just about to meet my friend, Mark, at his house. I talked with Ben after his trip to hear more about what he learned. The local community is Haredi Jewish. Most of them are also Hasidic, which means they have particular ways of dressing, and particular religious rights, and so on. And I met with three leaders in the Haredi community in North London: Mark Groskopf, Shmuel Davidson, and Motty Pinter. : My name is Mark Groskopf and I’m from the Jewish Tottenham community. Mark is a family man with nine children, one of whom has left the house. I’m Shmuel Davidson. I’m from the Tottenham Jewish association. I’m also a deputy on the board of deputies and being a community activist here in the area, where I’ve lived all my life. And I thrive to build this area. Shmuel is a man who’s very much in demand. During our interview, he had to leave to take phone calls about five times constantly responding to community’s desires and needs. My name is Motty Pinter. I work for Chinuch UK, which is the representative body for 80 Haredi schools across the country. I also work for Agudas Israel Housing Association. Motty is the extremely energetic leader of the Hackney community. We liaise with the council and we do a lot of work with the council. So any issues, they’ll come in to try to understand the Jewish community and see what the needs are. This community has lots of kids on average. One of the stats said their average number of children was six.  In Hackney, 8.1% of the population is Haredi. But when you look at the children population, you have 25.9% of the children population in Hackney is Haredi. When you drill that down to two to five-year-olds, you have over 30% of children, which are Haredi now. So what you figure is how many households. So all of these families having six children, the houses just weren’t built for them. Most communities, if they get overcrowded, decide to move out to the suburbs where land is cheaper, rather than staying in central London where land is more expensive. However, the Haredi Jewish community were not willing to do this because all of their cultural amenities are in one place. I can’t just move randomly to another borough where I don’t have a synagogue, I don’t have a kosher shop, I don’t have schools. My daily life is going synagogue. It’s just part of my daily routine. We pray three times a day. Going to the synagogue is just what we do. We can’t just move random everywhere. We don’t have a synagogue. It’s not, we just don’t have a life. My whole life, my whole family life will just be completely not there. Take for example, weekend Shabbat, I don’t use public transport. We have to walk. So I need a synagogue within walking distance.I need kosher food. I can’t just go to the local grocery store and find food there. There’s no kosher food there. I need to be able to go shopping on a daily basis. I need a bakery. I need a kosher bakery. I need a butcher. I need a kosher butcher. I need a school for my children. My children could go to non-Jewish school, however, culturally inappropriate. Yes, they will be educated nationally, the proper way, as education goes, however, the cultural appropriate education, the religious education, they will not get and they won’t feel comfortable there. I won’t feel comfortable. This is part of my daily life, my daily infrastructure. So we need to be living in an area where we have the community infrastructure, the synagogues, the shops, the schools, everything we need as a community and live our lives. So all of these things make it very difficult for the Haredi community to spread out. They need to be near one another and they have a very vibrant cultural life as well, which is another reason why they would like to be near, with one another as well. All of these things meant they weren’t willing to move out. So instead of moving out, the Haredi Jewish community decided, "Well, should we buy more of the houses in the neighborhood and spread out in each direction?" Well, firstly, it’s very expensive. It might cost them 500,000 pounds to buy the next door neighbor’s house. Secondly, that takes houses off the market and that means other people can’t live there. And finally, there just aren’t enough houses to go round. The housing challenges the Haredi community face are just one example. Any neighborhood can grow beyond its limits because of high birth rates, increased immigration, or simply because it’s a newly desirable place to live, but the Haredi community represents this perfect storm of housing crisis. They have on average eight people in their families. They need to be within walking distance of certain shops and community services, making it really hard to relocate. And the area where they live is way too expensive to buy any neighboring homes. If they can work their way through a housing crisis, shouldn’t it be doable anywhere?Stuck in the situation where they needed more space, some Haredi families decided to just start modifying their homes. But because of housing regulations in the UK, that’s easier said than done. Ben explains. So in the UK, we have something called planning, which is what Americans call zoning. But the difference between planning and zoning is that zoning is usually rules-based, so there are a bunch of rules that say what you can build and where, and then developers have to follow those rules. Planning in the UK is discretion-based, so every individual house, if you want to extend that house by adding a story or putting a different window on it or something like that, you have to apply to the local government and say, "Please, can I do this?"There are almost no developments that you can do without a specific permit with the council, which is the local government, going through the details of that permit, and councils look through every application bit by bit. And so it makes it very uncertain, very costly to pursue development because it’s uncertain whether you’re going to get permission or not. Some of them were building up in the maximum way they were allowed under the current rules or even pushing the rules to the limit. Building ugly box dormers is what they call them: boxes. And neighbors were objecting to these because they were unsightly and they were ruining the original heritage of the Victorian buildings, but they needed the space. So there was this conundrum where they wanted space, but the existing ways of delivering space were insufficient and ugly. Here’s Shmuel Davidson. There was no basic guidelines on what the rights, what the wrongs were. People were trying all sorts of things and it was just causing all sorts of problems for planning, enforcement, and it was just getting nowhere. And it got to the point where the community and the local authority really became heads up together and the whole thing. So they petitioned the council and said, "Look, can we build upwards?" Mark Groskopf again. And Shmuel and I was going backwards and forwards saying, "Look, let’s come up with a solution." And it was actually after sitting, going backwards and forward, they turned their around and said, "Look, you know what? These actual lofts are ugly. Let’s come up with a new plan." We want a space, they wanted looks. Working with the council, the community came up with the idea of extending the buildings upwards in a way that was consistent with their existing style so that the street looked like it had just been originally built as a Victorian three-story street. Basically, you take off the roof, you add in an extra story that looks just like the one underneath and then you put the roof back on. So it just looks like the original building, but stretched upwards. It can get four or five in some cases, six bedrooms added on top. And over the years, the community began to make some progress working with the local council. Here’s Motty Pinter. They would put forward the most recent update, people would be able to argue over it or say their opinions. They would put things down on the table and say, "These are ideas that the architects have raised." And then people around the room would be able to say, "Yeah, but this won’t work here or it will work here." The council in Haringey was surprisingly open to the Haredi community’s ideas, but there was still some opposition. We heard different views from different people. Some of those have been extremely challenging. For some people, they see this as something new and they’re concerned how it’s going to look and how it’s going to end up. In this area, we had actually people, residents who worked silently against it. However, once we came about the design, with the concept, with the idea, working endlessly with the local authority, with both the politicians and the officers, together with community. And with the product we were going to deliver, I think all around, the opponents, very nice, but they saw the benefits just outweighed the opponents a million times. It still took years and years of work from the community to get the design code put through and make it so that if they made a planning application to the council, the council was very likely to say, "Yes, as long as it stayed within the rules they had set out in advance." I think once this is actually introduced and it’s introduced more widely, I think a lot of those fears won’t be there anymore. I think it’s just people being concerned about what is going to happen, but when it actually happens, they’re going to see a lot of benefit. When I grew up here, the concept of building extensions, those days was virtually nonexistent. And I see families today who have built like what we’re standing in front of now, which… There’s one going on right now as we speak. Right. I was going to say that it’s going up right now, which has just made a complete life changer, a life changer to the area, a life changer to the families. The design, it just fits into a beautifully Victorian side of the houses. It doesn’t look odd. It doesn’t stand out. The quality gives to the family, to the people. And if you just go around the area, just see the development, which has gone on here, which has been achieved by this magnificent idea, which I think we’re unique for the country, I think. And it’s absolutely amazing.I just hope others will just copy us and do that because as there’s a housing crisis generally across everywhere, and we know there’s just no housing. Our achievement was the product which we have, which we see today. And this is a phenomenal product and it’s a product of community coalition, a product of working with the local politicians, a product working with the local offices, a product working with local residents, consultations, perseverance, nonstop, and knowing where your end goal is going to be and really go for it.Never drop out, never give up. Because eventually, if that’s what you want to get achieved, I want to get there, you’ll get there. What Mark, Shmuel, Motty and the rest of the Haredi community were able to make happen in South Tottenham is ultimately a success story. And the numbers would suggest that this success should be replicable. Haredi families have, on average, around six children. The birth rate in England and Wales in 2020 was 1.58 children per woman, a much smaller number. So if the Haredi community can create abundant housing with such a high population growth rate, certainly, it could be done across the larger UK population. But remember that it didn’t just magically happen, it took perseverance and patience, and working within the system to make progress.But why can’t the system be more accommodating to encourage more housing in the first place? Why does it take so much effort to build housing, something that London desperately needs? What we see if we look at traditional zoning in places like England is that they were never designed to streamline that sort of process. They were never designed to solve those political challenges. I mean, zoning was essentially designed to stop change in many places. This is John Myers. He’s working at the forefront of pushing for housing reform in the UK. We shouldn’t be surprised that we’re not getting plentiful housing in areas with zoning, because it was never designed to allow the densification that we used to see historically over centuries in cities, and which led to much loved urbanism that you see in historic housing cities in Europe today. His work goes back to 2014. John read an article that made him realize just how upside down the housing market truly was. It explained that the total market price of housing in the UK was three times more than what it would cost to rebuild all of that housing at today’s prices from scratch. And so that to me was the biggest distortion I’ve ever seen in any market or industry anywhere. It’s just an eye watering shortage. And it tells you that there’s something really wrong there. It means that the reason why housing is so expensive in London is not because there’s some shortage of land or because we have a brick shortage, it’s because you’re simply not allowed to build more even when it would be enormously economically beneficial to do so. And that was just the most broken thing I’ve ever seen. John’s organization is called YIMBY Alliance, which stands for: Yes, in My Backyard. It’s a counter to NIMBY or Not in My Backyard. The NIMBY acronym was born from neighborhoods that didn’t want the downsides of new housing near them. Understandably, there are plenty of reasons to not want certain projects in your neighborhood. After all, who wants to live next to a coal power plant or a garbage dump? But when it comes to building housing, the effects are generally felt very locally: things like construction noise and additional traffic. And so the idea behind John’s YIMBY movement is that the collective economic and social benefits of allowing new developments will outweigh any short-term side effects. And John’s proposal is to leave the decision to build denser housing to the people who live on the street, where the housing will actually be built. It’s a proposal he calls ‘street votes.’ If somebody turns a single family home on your street into say townhouses or into low rise, apartment blocks, that mainly only affects the other people on your street, especially if effects on parking and other traffic congestion are controlled carefully.So there’s no real reason why, if the broad majority, the overwhelming majority of people on your street, are happy for those sorts of developments to happen to gracefully allow single family homes to be turned into townhouses or even something a bit more ambitious. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to choose to allow that so long as the neighbors on other streets are protected. Street votes certainly sounds like a winning scenario for neighborhoods with each individual voter deciding for themselves if they’d like to capture the benefits of new developments. But of course, it’s not always easy for entire neighborhoods to come together. In South Tottenham, for example, the neighbors were opposed to changing the aesthetic of the old homes there. They ultimately found a solution, but surely, looks can’t be the only thing holding back new housing. Is there more behind this resistance to change? Thank you. I think we’re good. Yeah? Yep. And my phone has just gone... yeah, no, it’s still working away there. Hello! Yes, I’m so excited about this.I got in touch with Ronan Lyons. My name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. Ronan is a bit of a housing guru in Ireland. People in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the daft reports. Daft is like Zillow or the Right Move in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal. Once a quarter or twice a quarter, one for rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. In Ireland, we see the same story playing out as in so many other countries. In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many... especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. It turns out, the history of these rules are part of the reason it’s so hard to change housing policy. What had happened between the ’40s and the ’70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate. What it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country, now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. That was kind of a key turning point. Because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever, and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet. And so when politicians are trying to appeal to voters, anything that will affect the value of their homes can get politically dicey. When they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get the elected to do so. People who come along, they won’t phrase it like this, "I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes." That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way, you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "And I’m going to price that new households." That’s a vote winner.If you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who are there already and secured their housing, have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Despite this individual opposition, the benefits of growth and new housing are widespread throughout society. There’s better investment in infrastructure, attracting new businesses, creating more jobs. And of course, keeping house prices affordable. And with John Myers’ street votes plan, he believes that there will be enough people who see through the short-term to the larger upside.And he’s hopeful because he’s seen this localized effort work outside the UK. First, in Israel. The most recent example that comes to mind is in Tel Aviv where the government proposed the means for residents to be allowed to decide if they wanted to redevelop their own apartment block, either extend it or to replace it with an entire new block with more apartments in it. That accounted for about 35% of the new homes in Tel Aviv in 2020. It’s an astonishing increase. Second, in South Korea in the 1990s. The government allowed areas of single story homes to vote collectively if they wanted to give themselves permission to redevelop that whole area. And again, that accounted for the majority, I think, of the new condos built in Seoul for a portion of the 1990s. Lastly, a city in my home state: Houston, Texas Houston, as you know, doesn’t have zoning in the traditional sense of the term, but it does have what are called minimum lot size requirements. And that says that if you want to build a new home, you have to have a piece of land which is at least a certain size. Those sizes were quite big. And the city of Houston wanted to reduce that size to allow more homes to be built in Houston, to keep Houston affordable for renters. There was a fair amount of political resistance from people living in areas of single family homes with large lot areas. And so in order to overcome that pushback, they decided to allow effectively an opt-out from the change that they were proposing and that let them get that change through, and you see the results in Houston where there’s a lot of new housing being constructed as a result of that. There are a lot of homeowners who are probably better off because their plot can now be used for more housing than it was before. And yet, the people who are most resistant to change have been able to opt out.And so this principle of giving flexibility on a very small level can make it much more politically palatable to engineer change and to get more housing. If you offer families a way to literally change their lives, the way to guarantee housing for their children or their grandchildren, a way to make it much easier to live, and all they have to do is vote for graceful change, which is completely consistent with what we’ve seen in cities over centuries, I have to believe that a small amount of people will do that. And that’s very consistent with what we’ve seen in Tel Aviv. It’s consistent with what happened in Seoul. And it’s also consistent with the fact that most of Houston didn’t opt out of these changes. And as John points out, the needle doesn’t have to move that much to see real change. We don’t actually need to upzone the entire London or the entire of the Bay Area in order to get vastly amounts, more housing. So in London, if you just took 3, 4, 5% of the lowest density areas, you would engineer a step change. You would more than double the supply of housing in London. With all of these examples, John feels optimistic that street votes can gain some real political momentum in the UK. We’ve seen quite a fair amount of traction in England with that. We’ve been lucky enough to find an incredible coalition that has supported these sorts of ideas, because it’s ultimately not very controversial. There aren’t really that many people who disagree with the proposition. But if the people on the street want to see more development, they should be allowed to permit it. I want to put it on pause for a second? That’s okay. But it’s fine to get extra… I have a tendency to talk too much. You don’t stop me, then.. Finally, back in South Tottenham, Ben wrapped up his interview with Mark, Shmuel, and Motty. By one estimate, the Haredi community has added a thousand extra bedrooms using their method of building extensions. Okay. So let’s have a little look around. And Mark himself had recently constructed a loft conversion onto his own Victorian house. It was built about six months ago. So I was living in a bedroom, seven kids living in one bedroom, three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. That’s how the family was living. So before Ben left, Mark gave him a tour of the house. You’ve come into the hallway, you’ve got a dining room. So it’s quite a big dining room which we’ll extend it slightly. And then… Mark has a very large dining room, presumably to fit his nine children, wife, and self in having dinner at the same time. Let’s go upstairs. And we go upstairs and Mark shows me what the house originally looked like. There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms. In one of the bedrooms was the master bedroom and the other bedroom was seven of his children. This is where we had three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. We got two bunk beds. Now, there’s only two children in that original seven-children bedroom. And the other children are all spread across different bedrooms. And we got another floor. And he’s added four bedrooms on the top floor. And then you’ve got a front room over here, as you can see how big it is. Wow. Imagine. So you were going from that room where there were six of them in there. And then now, they’ve got a huge two-bedroom. That’s correct. He says that this has made a huge difference to his children’s experience of school, to the togetherness, everyone’s getting along better. It really is striking how one-and-a-half extra stories can make such a large difference to how much space there is to go around when there’s seven children’s crammed into one bedroom, it must be much harder to have lots of the things that you want as a child. And then we go up to the next floor. And what I’ve done is in this area over here, where the front of the house goes alone, we call it the apex. We’ve left over there and it’s a center room. We use it as a center room. So you’ve got the toys down over there. And then the kids go inside over there and relax and enjoy themselves over there. Mark’s family looks after kids with special needs from the community. Every weekend, we bring kids in from the other families to give the parents a rest… In the low ceiling part, he put in a sensory room with interesting lights and sounds and so on for kids to go in. And apparently, they really like it.Wow. Well, my mother would love to meet you then because she does a lot of work.It’s amazing how much they’ve managed to add how many... they’ve got extra bedrooms. They make all the space, they’ve got extra bathrooms, and this is all just on the existing plot. is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for the series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Dave Yim. Whitney Chen is our production manager extraordinaire. Our sound mixer and sound designer is Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. That’s it for this episode of . I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. We’ll see you next time. Welcome to  B-sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to last week’s episode of this podcast, you heard excerpts from my interview with Dr. Ronan Lyons. He’s an associate professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and the director of Trinity Research and Social Sciences, an interdisciplinary research initiative that brings together scholars from across the university. In our conversation, he offers insights into the complexities of housing broadly and explains why the challenges plaguing housing markets are especially acute in Ireland. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dr. Ronan Lyons. Hello. Yes, I’m so excited about this. Okay. So the first thing I’m just going to have you do is introduce yourself and your academic affiliations, if you will. Sure. So my name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin, where I’m also the director of a center called Trinity Research and Social Sciences which is like a collection of a few hundred research active social scientists across all disciplines in the social sciences here in Trinity and people in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the Daft Reports. Daft.ie is like the Zillow or the Rightmove in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal and once a quarter or twice a quarter, once for a rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. So Ronan, well, that’s actually really helpful. I’m curious about your journey into housing. How did that become a topic of interest for you? And I’m also curious, if I may, about your personal housing situation, because you have...it’s three children, is that right? That’s right. Three boys, six and under, so a busy household. So I actually studied as an undergrad at Trinity and I did economics and political science. And afterwards, as many people find themselves, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do and I was in the lucky position that I was offered a scholarship to stay at Trinity. And I did some research in economic history, the history of trade and globalization, which I found really interesting, but then you’re like, "Well, I’ve picked one thing and I fall into one thing, what else do I want to do?" So I worked in policy making for a while. I worked for the National Competitiveness Council in Ireland. So Ireland as a small open economy is really dependent on its ability to trade internationally. So the Competitiveness Council advises the prime minister and the cabinet on where Ireland is doing well or badly.So that gave me a, I suppose, a taste of policy analysis, policy advice, and policy making and how policy happens. And at the same time, a friend of mine had set up daft.ie, the Irish property portal when he was in high school. And after I finished my degree, he came to me and he said, "Could we do a report where we look at the...just the rental sector in Ireland and how it’s performing?" Because there weren’t...it wasn’t the same, I suppose, measurement of housing market conditions at the time. So I accidentally ended up in housing but after working in...I was doing this as a side gig and I was working for the Competitiveness Council and I did a bit of work for IBM as part of their policy consulting.And I was moving around. So I had done research, I’d done policy making, I did private sector, but I realized that actually the thing I really enjoyed was research. So I had gone wandering around, but I came full circle. And in some ways you have to do that, right? You have to go and, or somebody like me has to do that. I need to know what I’m not doing to know that I’ve made the right choice, but in 2009, then I started at Oxford, a doctorate there looking at the Irish housing bubble and crash. And I finished 2013 and I was lucky enough that Trinity was hiring at the time. So I started in the department of economics then and I’ve kept those economic history or long run economic development as one hat and housing is another hat.And I see them as related because when you look at housing and you look at real estate, if you think about the immobility of a home or a building, when you buy it, you’re buying the opportunity associated with the location. And unlike a worker can move and financial capital can move and some workers are more or less mobile, that’s certainly true, but a dwelling isn’t. So the idea of using housing and using land to tell us something about what is good or bad about a location or what people are more or less confident about for me, that’s the heart of why real estate and why housing is really interesting in addition to the very obvious thing that we all need somewhere to live, right? And if...as we’ll presumably get onto, if we don’t have enough places to live, then all sorts of problems arise from that. That’s actually exactly the next question. It’s so funny as we’ve done some of these interviews, one of the producers are working with was like, "Tammy, I think you take for granted the idea that people just know what’s going on with housing, what the problem even is, if there is one." So I might actually ask you that question as, and maybe you can both couch it in Ireland, this is very much an issue across the world. What is the basic challenge with housing right now? Whether it’s affordability, not having enough homes, et cetera. Can you explain it to me like I’m five? I’ll do my best. And I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many, especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. And some of that is population growth. And Ireland is I think, unusual in Europe in that it will have faster population growth this century than last century. And some of that’s the long shadow of, there was a famine in the 1840s and that’s why there’s such a large Irish-American community and there’s also a large Irish community in Britain as well. And that has those deep historical roots, but since the 1980s and 1990s, Ireland has had a successful business model where it’s a gateway to the single European market.And as a result of that, it has had all sorts of growing pains. As in incomes have gone up, population has gone up, Ireland has gone from net emigration to net immigration and all of those are signs of success, but unless you scale up the infrastructure as well, then you will come up with all sorts of congestion challenges. And the timing was fortuitous for things like road infrastructure, the European Union gave Ireland money to help build a motorway network. It didn’t have any highways 30 years ago, but in relation to housing, that’s a much more local issue and like many places, we have for various reasons, many of which are worthy, made it more difficult to build a home. So in addition to the population angle, we also have something that’s common in other countries as well but I think Ireland is particularly acute in this, changing demographics.So if you think of countries on a journey from having households of four or five persons on average to households having one or two persons on average, and some cases, maybe three, but you see, average household size is going from four to two, even with the same population, you need twice as many homes, but the homes are different. And on top of that, if you go from rural to urban in the same a hundred year transition, you are going from larger rural homes to smaller urban homes. And that’s a challenge of location and it’s a challenge of mix, but it’s also a challenge of viability because not everything scales down, you need plumbing, you need a bathroom and a shower and a toilet and a kitchen, regardless of how many people you have in the home. You need some basic infrastructure in there.So providing a home for one person is not a quarter of the cost of providing one home for four people. And I think that’s a big challenge that Ireland has struggled with and I think other countries struggled with as well, it’s perhaps less obvious than the population increase bit but certainly in Ireland’s case, providing urban housing for smaller households is not something the country is good at and it’s even a struggle to get politicians and policy makers to recognize the scale of that need. Could you explain basically what happens when the housing stock doesn’t match population growth or immigration? Yeah. So actually part of my doctorate, one of the main chapters was trying to come up with what you might think of as a house price equation. What happens, house prices or housing prices if income goes up, if supply goes up, if credit conditions get tighter or looser, and the credit conditions bit was super important at the time, because Ireland was coming out of a bubble and crash situation. So that was the focus at the time was how much, if nothing else changes and you loosen credit conditions, what happens property prices and sure enough, they go up and tightening them brings them back down again. And a lot of macro credential rules are about trying to level that out, take that channel for amplifying house prices up and down and just really calm it down.So that then leaves you once you at least try and contain those credit conditions, then it leaves you with this battle between supply and fundamental demand rather than credit demand or assets, factors like that. And on the fundamental demand side, you’ve got income per household and you’ve got household size. And those two things in Ireland’s case have been in...household size been going down, right? So you need more households per population or more dwellings per population and incomes have been going up. And this is another tricky bit for policy makers, the richer you get, the more you consume of everything, some things you shift into and some things you shift out of, but you consume on balance more of everything, the richer you get and that includes housing.And going back to that piece of research I did for my thesis, one of the things we were trying to do was take out that bit and say, "Okay, if you hold income constant then you increase supply by 10%, what happens?" And our best estimate was that if you did that exercise, you would lower prices by about 12%. And that’s a fundamental that, again, in many countries, people are questioning, right? Because they see completions going up, more new homes getting built and they see prices of rents going up and they go, "You can’t say to me that if you build more homes, prices will go down because that’s not happening at the moment." And really this gets to the heart of the social science of housing is that that correlation is not about causation, that what’s actually happening here is that homes are getting built because there’s a lot of need.And in Ireland’s case, there’s a need for maybe 40 to 50,000 homes a year and it’s only building 20,000. Now, if you didn’t build those 20,000, rents and sale prices would increase even more. And that’s the tricky bit because it’s very hard to argue with someone who doesn’t, who sees the correlation and doesn’t believe the underlying theory. It’s hard to say to them, "Well, let’s stop building and let’s see how that goes," right? That’s not a viable suggestion because that would make things worse, not better. The conversation about housing tends to be so polarized, especially online, but we’re talking about people’s livelihoods, right? I’m Nigerian, my parents immigrated to the US when I was about two months old and thank goodness they found a house in Texas where we grew up but say they had moved to New York, I think the situation would be very different or in Ireland where my grandfather worked for a substantial part of his career. Anyway, I digress. We know that house prices increasing is one of the obvious effects of restricting the supply of housing for whatever reason. But I wonder too, if you could just talk about some of the less well understood effects of restricting the supply of housing. I mean, Ireland’s a good example of...I mean, it’s hidden and people don’t talk about it that much, but I mentioned earlier, Ireland’s really dependent on international investment or at least outwardly focused. Some of it’s indigenous and some of it’s coming from overseas, but it’s about creating economic activity for exports, right? You’re tapping into the European market. But over the last few years, the housing has been so scarce that firms have been holding back on expanding. I mean, think about how wrong that is, right? That you actually could hire an extra 2,000 people and you’re choosing not to, not because you can’t find work for them, but you can’t find housing for them. I’m not saying everywhere suffers from that, but there are, I think lots of places. If you look at New York and Tokyo over the last 50, 60 years, New York and Tokyo are roughly the same size, they have now...since the 60s, they’ve had very different setups in terms of the ability to build new housing. Tokyo is now about twice as big as New York.And people will say, "Well, New York’s big enough already. It doesn’t need to get any bigger," but the point is, and you talk to say the economic geographers, people like Enrico Moretti or whatever, and it’s the geography of where people are productive. And there are certain features about locations that make them productive and that would allow people to choose themselves if they want to move from say one part of the US to another, in order to move into a growing industry. And if housing is stopping that either internally in the US or internationally in the case of Ireland, that’s a real direct cost. I mean, housing is always in everywhere, right? Someone’s shelter, right? It’s their home at nighttime, but housing is seeping into being about livelihoods as well. And whether we are enabling people to have the most fulfilled potential that they can, that if we’re not getting housing, right? That’s for me, one of the...it’s not hidden, but it’s maybe not always highlighted, the cost of not enough housing, but it does seep through everywhere. If you don’t have enough housing... I wow my undergrads with the story that say 20 years ago, I had friends who moved out of their parents’ home in Dublin to rent a property in Dublin while they were in college, because they were just like, "Well, hey, I’m an adult, I’ll go off and I’ll find somewhere to live."That is so far from the possibility now, if you’re a 19 year old student in Dublin, I mean, you just stay at home with your parents. There’s no option. You may even have to commute. If you’re outside Dublin, you may be commuting an hour and a half every way, very early in the morning and very late at night to go to college. And that has a cost too, in terms of all sorts of things that are forgone that I took for granted when I was an undergrad that today’s undergrads can’t do. And I think they’re hidden costs as well in terms of forming people and their opportunities, because those years say between 20 and 25 are so crucial to people who are, say, in the higher education space. They’re so crucial to what happens afterwards. Everything is path dependent. Absolutely. I really appreciate that in particular, because I think it’s just poorly understood. Okay. So this is actually not super relevant to the podcast, but I’m personally curious about it. Can you summarize Ireland’s housing bubble and its subsequent crash in 2007? What happened there? Yeah. You will see it given as an example of, well, this is almost like the textbook case of this is what happens when you let markets go wild. And I think that misses a key part of the story. Clearly the global credit gloss in the early 2000s was an important factor, but you have to rewind a little bit. And in the mid, late 1990s policy makers were grappling with this idea that Ireland is growing, Dublin is growing, how are we going to provide new housing? And they came up with this scheme that said, "Let’s regenerate parts of Dublin as Ireland’s biggest city and we’ll allow people to write off construction costs for building new homes." So it started out with this urban renewal thing, and that actually worked quite well.I mean, you had organizations that weren’t particularly familiar with building apartments, they’re used to building houses and then they were building apartments. So there might be other quality issues there that we can come back to. But overall, the goal of getting new housing, where there was long term demand was by and large met and actually rents fell during Ireland’s boom and bubble. So many new rental homes were built that rents were cheaper in 2004, 5, 6 than they were in ’98, ’99, 2000. And that’s fascinating because Irish people forget this because they just remember when the sale prices bit was through the roof. So politicians looked at this and went, "That’s interesting. So if we do this tax relief thing, we get lots of housing. So let’s try it in all the other constituencies where we want to get reelected," right?So they went off and they said, "Rural parts of Ireland, let’s get loads of housing built." And it was a no brainer for a developer because they could...the rental income didn’t have to be from the property they were building somewhere in rural Ireland. It could be from anywhere and it didn’t have to be that year. It could be, at some point over the next number of years. So they could build these properties and either good case scenario, they get someone to live in them, worst case scenario, they don’t, and they still get a lower tax bill and unsurprisingly tens of thousands of homes were built in places where there was no long term need. And at the same time you had this credit bubble, which was pushing up prices in lots of countries, the US, UK, Spain and Ireland was right up there at the fore, incomes were going up, confidence was high, banks were getting into mortgages.We had savings and loans like institutions building societies, but they gave way to the banks and the banks became the main mortgage providers, but they didn’t realize what they were playing with and they were giving people more and more leverage. So you had these two things going on, lots of new homes getting built and prices going up a lot. And then the global gloss stopped. The bubble stopped, the music stopped and then things turned pretty quickly. And the government at the same time decided to end the cost release. They were like, "Hang on, what are we doing here actually? And we should stop these release." So Ireland in around 2007 turned and went from a decade of phenomenal increases in the stock of housing and in prices, and that prices bit that was credit driven, it went the other way and prices fell by about 55% in the space of five years. And that’s like a national average.In some segments, if you’re in one of these places that got lots of extra housing, one of these rural markets, the cost of a smaller home might have fallen by 80%. And even to this day, some of those rural counties that saw the most construction relative to the number of people in those early 2000s years, housing today is still the same cost it was 20 years ago because so much was built. In Dublin, not enough was built even in the bubble years and housing is about a third more expensive now than it was in 2000. It’s certainly, not even 20 years, it went up and down and then up again. But paradoxically for...the narrative in Ireland would be that, "Well supply doesn’t keep prices under control because look what happened in the early 2000s."Paradoxically what happened in the early 2000s, when you take a step back and take out the credit bubble is a stunning endorsement of the idea that more supply makes housing more affordable because if you’re in Leitrim or Longford, which are these rural counties that saw some of the most housing built, housing is really affordable there now compared to Dublin where it’s not. And so that’s why in your Works in Progress piece, you talk about the Irish ghost towns that actually aren’t ghost towns or at least weren’t intended to be. It’s so funny because in that answer, you actually answer like the next three questions. Your dissertation at Oxford in it, you detail the various factors that affect home prices in Ireland. Could you share some of those factors? Yeah. What I had in mind here and I guess, I’m slightly different to the standard academic because I had had that experience of seeing how policy makers worked, or at least I’d like to think I’m slightly...everyone does, right? Everyone’s slightly different. But I said, "Okay, there’s a morass of factors that can affect housing prices, but can we distill them down to the three, four, five, six most important ones? And I was lucky that I had a supervisor who sees...I’m in many ways, I’m a product of his way of seeing the world, right? My way of approaching a question like that, I like to think is mine, but really it’s, I’m inheriting a lot of his way of tackling these questions. So you could have 50 factors that drive house prices, but we were trying to come up with this list of the most important, so that we could say to policy makers, "If you’re looking at, if you want to control housing prices, if you want to see what’s going to happen next, these are the most important."And I mentioned household income, right? So if household income goes up or down and that can go up or down for a number of different reasons. One of the reasons household income went up in Ireland, say from the 90s to the 2010s was because more and more women were actively in the labor market. So instead of one income or one and a quarter income, you might have one and a half or two incomes and that will boost household income or unemployment, right? So in aggregate, the higher the unemployment rate, the fewer incomes there are per household, right? On average. So there’s a lot going on in that measure. So household income is one, household size is another. And one of the things that was under the hood at the time, and I’m focusing more on now to try and get the point across to policy makers, is that Ireland going from say a three and a half persons per household to two and three quarters, right? That pushed up prices by between 40 and 50% in the space of three decades or so. And I don’t think that’s appreciated. You’ve the same number of dwellings, but you’ve more and more households even with a similar population. And of course in Ireland’s case population was going up, household size was going down. So there’s an even greater increase in the number of households. And then there’s the supply factor, right? So controlling for all those demand factors, fundamental demand factors, the supply, and there’s the three fundamentals and you’ve got asset factors as well. And one of the asset factors is what’s known in the literature as user cost. So how much does it cost you to hold a property one year to the next?And some of that is they say expected capital gains, right? If you think your property’s going to go up 20% between now and next year, it doesn’t really matter if you have 1% property taxes or your cost of borrowing is 3%, you are going to get...you think you’re going to get this 20% gain. And that was a huge driver of demand. And then the final factor is credit conditions that how much...for a given set of savings, how much is the financial system leveraging you up? And in Ireland, like in many countries, we went from say, 25% deposits in the late 90s to sometimes 5% or 0% deposits in 10 years later.And if you think of that as in and of itself, going from 25% deposit to a 5% deposit, the same savings are going to get stretched at a huge amount more in terms of the mortgage you get given. Now, other factors come in there, but those are the five ones: household income, household size, housing supply, the user cost and credit conditions. And we put numbers beside them and said, "Okay, if you want to think about what drives house prices, an X percent increase in incomes will do this," and so on. Was it like multiple regression analysis? Yeah. So in terms of the methods, what we were using were...they’re macro econometric methods. So what you’re trying to do is run regressions where you want to maximize the ability of the data to tell you what’s going on. You don’t want to say, "Well, we’re going to assume people are this risk averse or that," whatever it might be, you want to let the data tell you as much as possible. So it makes sense on a first pass theory level, it makes sense that supply is going to be relevant for the cost of housing and incomes and so on. And you can put them in and see what they tell you. And you can also break it down and say earlier or later which factors are most important.And that was one of the punchlines at the time, which was almost 10 years ago, was that ’95 to 2001 prices increased…house prices increased a lot in Ireland, but it was a mix of lots of different things. As Ireland went from being a declining population country to a rising population, rising income country. ’01 to ’07, it was almost entirely credit conditions, right? Basically nothing else changed. Yes, supply went up, but incomes went up almost one to one to match. So that the...of the, I think it was the 8% increase on average per year in inflation adjusted housing prices, seven and a half percent was coming just from credit conditions. A comment and a question. The comment would be, I’ve never heard anybody mention the shrinking of household sizes being a relevant factor in the increasing demand for housing but it seems so obvious when you think about it. So that’s very interesting. The question would be, you mentioned something a few answers ago about the difference between New York and Tokyo, decades ago they had the same population size and now Tokyo is both much larger, but also...I mean, I don’t know how much larger, but also much denser. And I know that that... I know very little about this, but I know that’s related to the differences in how Americans are even extending it, the West tends to treat housing as an investment rather than how Tokyo in Japan tend to treat housing. Could you speak to those differences a little bit? Yeah. And there’s a great author called Bill Fischel who’s written something called  and more recently had a book called . And if you read , he’s an economist himself one, who’s proficient in the law. And he has a good caricature of economists at the start of the book where it’s like an economist assumed that planners are just economically illiterate and stop the building of housing for some reasons due to their own preferences. And it’s like, no planners are responding to the demand for planning that when they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get reelected to do so, that people who come along and go, I will—but they won’t phrase it like this—I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes.That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way you’ve got to not dog whistle it in but you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "I’m going to price that new households," that’s a vote winner. And I think a lot of it comes from...there’s a website WTF Happened in 1971, right? There’s all these charts that suddenly just change in 1971. And we can think of lots of potential factors in there. But I do think the 1970s, the unexpected inflation in the 1970s, possibly driven by the oil price shocks or a combination of factors, including the oil price shocks in places like the US, opened the eyes of homeowners to the idea that if inflation comes along, your debt stays the same size in nominal terms and your property value goes up. So inflation is bad from a consumption point of view, but if you’re a homeowner, it’s good because the real value of your debt goes down.And we’ve known this, that’s why we had hyperinflation after World War I, countries wanted to get the real size of their debt down, just add a few extra zeros to your currency and the debt goes away, that kind of thing. But doing it for households in a mass home ownership environment, because of course what had happened between the 40s and the 70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate for potentially very good reasons. But what it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. And that was a key turning point because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet and in some ways they’re entitled to do that.If I own a home and in principle, I could go out there and actively try and minimize the new housing supply to maximize the value of my home. Now, I think that would be incredibly hypocritical of me given what I passionately believe about housing to be doing that. So I try and do the opposite. I try and argue for more housing, even though it’s not in my own interests. And the economists are laughed at for assuming people are always super automatons and rational and so on. But in my case, I’m living proof that that’s not the case, I suppose. But in general, I do think that that switch got flicked in say in the US in the 1970s and it didn’t happen in other places.And that might be because the age structure is different in Japan now, if you increase interest rates, that could be an economic spur to activity, right? Because the age structure of the population, they’re net savers as opposed to net borrowers or there’s different things going on in different countries or it could be just the way the shock is felt. The same shock, but it’s felt in different ways in different countries. But certainly if you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who were there already and secured their housing have disproportionate power over new housing supply. It actually leads into...and I just have two more questions. The next question, which is, as you look...I find it unfortunate that, and I understand why these debates often get so charged, but I do find it a bit unfortunate and so I wonder as somebody who does support more liberalized zoning, what do you think are the most compelling arguments that opponents of liberalized zoning make? I mean, there are...one relates to quality I think, and one relates to distribution, right? So people who...and I would have...in the Irish housing debate and people can go on Twitter and see, I would say something and you’ll have...there’s a group of people who will argue vehemently that, against say, if I argue for new rental housing in Dublin, because it badly needed, people would say, "No, the rental housing is getting proposed is not adequate." And they’ll say either, for example, either it’s not good enough quality, so we need higher quality standards. Personally, I don’t think that’s true of the housing that’s getting built at the moment. I think I’ve tried to come up with a measure of it. Of course I did, I’m an economist, but I’ve tried to come up with the measure of the quality of housing and I estimate the housing that’s getting built now about 50% higher quality in terms of the input materials than housing about 20 years ago.So I don’t think that’s true, but I’m sympathetic to the argument that if you build poor quality housing, you are creating future problems. So we should be rigorous in terms of housing. Now there’s an opportunity cost, which gets to the distribution point, the higher your minimum standards, the more of the income distribution you’re pricing out. And I estimate that say Dublin city’s minimum standards around 2015 priced at 90% of the income distribution and that’s pointless, right? It’s pointless having minimum standards that only allow 10% of people to enjoy new housing, because what you do is you create segregated markets. So from a distributional point of view, I think new housing shouldn’t be the preserve of the market or shouldn’t be the preserve of the state or whatever, I think we need a holistic approach that says, if you think of it as three groups in the population, you’ve the group that are rich enough based on current standards and prices to afford housing in the market.You have a group that are poor enough based on whatever the standards are for providing social housing, that they qualify for social housing. And then you’ve got a group in the middle who are not rich enough to afford market housing and not poor enough to qualify for supported housing. And really if I were a housing minister or a secretary, I mean, that is your goal. Your goal is to make sure that group doesn’t exist, that they’re either in the market or in the supported housing sector. And for both in order to achieve that, you need both those groups, the market housing segment and the social or supported housing segment to be responsive to underlying need.So that’s an argument where basically social or supported housing is a compliment to market housing. It’s not a substitute and I think that’s one of the...one of my get out of jail cards when some of my critics come along and say, "You’re just like a shield for developers and it’s all about profit for you." I have one guy who likes calling me a money astrologist because I’m an economist or whatever. I’m like, my estimate of housing need is high enough that I think the state should be supporting the construction of maybe 15 to 20,000 homes a year. So I don’t think...I don’t know of any competitor in Ireland’s case that has a higher estimate of socializing than me. I also have a higher estimate of market need, because I believe the underlying need say for one and two person households, as we get older, as we start our families later, all that kind of stuff is adding new housing need, diversity of housing need.So I think on quality and distribution, there are points to be listened to. I’m super reluctant to take into account…I think of this, right. I live in central enough in Dublin, I can see the Guinness tower, right? From my bedroom window. I can look at it and go, "There’s the Guinness Storehouse," which is like one of the most popular tourist attractions in Ireland. Now, it’s not particularly attractive, but suppose it were super attractive and I’m like, "That’s part of my view, right? Across the road, there’s a site that’s going to get redeveloped and they’re going to put in, I think, five or six stories in group of apartments. I think I should be entitled to say, "Well, yes, I don’t think you should build that because I have a lovely view.” Now I think that observation on the new development should be given a weight of close to zero, right? It is effectively irrelevant for society, right, that I have a view of the Guinness Storehouse from my bedroom window.It’s nice for me, I didn’t buy the property because out of the window, I can see the Guinness Storehouse or whatever it might be. I think we need to be a lot more clear about the weight we give to arguments that are effectively arguments to keep housing prices high. As you look across Ireland and then maybe more broadly across the world. Are there reasons for optimism on housing? In Ireland, I think there are because things have been so...I mean, things were up and down for different reasons, but things have been so bad for the last 10 years that if you think of...just take the case of Dublin, Dublin is a city of about one and a half million people, about a half a million dwellings and the rental sector is about 150,000 rental dwellings, right? So not quite a third, but not far off. As things stand, they actually recognized this a couple years ago policy makers, they said, "We need to boost the supplier rental accommodation.” We are now in the opposite of the sweet spot. We’re in the eye of the storm at the moment because those plans have been lodged to build about 50,000 new rental homes but very few of them have come on stream.So you’ve people saying, "Look, you changed these rules three years ago," and of course COVID came in and didn’t help. And you changed these rules three years ago and nothing has changed. In fact, rents have gone up. Things are getting worse, not better. And I look and I see about 40 to 50,000 rental homes coming down on stream over the next five or six years. And I say, Dublin is going to be such a better city for having 200,000 rental homes rather than 150,000 rental homes. And yes, the new 50,000 are going to be expensive, but we have made them be expensive because we have high standards. And I know some people will disagree with that but I do believe that that’s true. We have high standards and the new rental accommodation is going to be expensive, reflecting that. So that’s the...I’m a natural born optimist.I see things getting slightly better and I do, and again, in the case of Ireland, I think the things were so bad in providing which you might think of as social or supported housing over the last 20 years. It was a decision in the early 1990s, implicitly, nobody ever stated this, but implicitly, it was let’s stop providing lots of social housing by the state and by lending more and more risky mortgages that we...and the US did the same thing effectively that that will step in, the market will step in for the state. And we know post 2007, that that’s not a reliable way to provide housing for all, but for about 10, 12 years in Ireland’s case, there was not a huge amount of progress. And just in the last 12 months or so, there’s been a bit of progress in terms of cost rental.So Jane Jacobs writes about this in her book about how would you provide housing for all…the Death and Life of Great American Cities. She talks about what we would call cost rental is that, if a third of your income is the most you can spend on housing, how could, what do you do for people for whom that’s not enough to cover the cost in new housing? And you got to top them up to get to that point. And Ireland is introducing a system a bit like that. And I think that’s going to make social housing or non-market housing, more responsive to underlying need. So I’m an optimist for Ireland, even though I could also give you the list of clouds in the horizon or things that I think are wrong, let’s go with optimism.More globally, if I’m an optimist it’s earlier in the pipeline of optimism, it’s hard to point generally. And it’s hard to summarize generally about housing. And there’s a couple of books actually, that I’ve seen coming out recently, one’s called , I think, and it’s trying to synthesize across countries. And actually some of my own work...I’m working on a project that’s funded by the National Science Foundation looking at housing prices in the US since the civil war and trying to measure prices at a city level. And in doing that and in doing the same for Ireland and in doing the same for Canada to contribute to an international, not debate, because I think that sets us up in the wrong, but International evidence base around what’s happening in housing markets now and how it fits into a longer term picture.But I’ve digressed a little bit. The drawing, I suppose, drawing conclusions about the global housing system or even the housing system in the high income world, if I’m optimistic, I think it’s because there’s a lot more people who believe housing to be important to research. And we know so much more than we did 10 years ago, so that’s on the research side, that of optimism. I think that will filter through into the policy side, but I do think that every country is going to have to come up with its own way of wrestling with the, yeah, the promiscuous veto with the power of incumbents and some of it, some countries may not be able to solve that until you’ve...things have got so bad. You’ve got a majority of renters in certain key parts of your country and then the power switches. Ronan, that’s all I have. Thank you, so, so, so much.  is a production of Stripe Press.

That’s it for this B-side, I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is  B-sides. It’s New Year’s Eve 2016. Then governor Andrew Cuomo and his wife descend an escalator underneath second avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Behind them, ride a gaggle of men in suits and women in evening gowns. Cuomo flashes a smile to one of the dozens of cameras followed by a thumbs up and a wave. They turn to board a colorfully decorated new subway car emblazoned with the words second avenue. It’s the kind of grandiose ribbon cutting moment that every politician dreams of.Archived audio: We needed to show people that government works and we can still do big things and great things, and we can still get them done. But this was no ordinary transit project. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project ever.Welcome to Beneath the Service, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our last episode, we looked at rising housing costs. Today we’re looking at what could be considered the other side of the same infrastructure coin, transit. I grew up in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. We have the Dart, or Dallas Area Rapid Transit, but its efficiency and convenience leave a lot to be desired. According to census data compiled by homearea.com, the share of commuters in the Dallas Fort Worth Metro area that use public transit is—1.4%. And that tracks with my experience.Growing up, I would take a train once in a while, but only on special occasions to the Texas state fair or the stockyards in Fort worth. Trains were a special treat, not something that was part of my main transportation diet. By contrast, I moved to New York City in 2021 and the city subway has just become a part of my daily life, as it is to 3.1 million other New Yorkers.And I learned that only a few years before I arrived, a new subway line opened underneath second avenue in Manhattan. It was a rare new addition to one of the largest and oldest subway systems in the world. Phase one of the project was completed in 2017. It is a modest two miles of track and three stations. It runs through the upper east side neighborhood. The price tag was around 4.4 billion dollars, and that’s just one of the four phases of construction. Phase two will extend the line north into East Harlem and is expected to open sometime between 2027 and 2029. The cost of phase two is expected to surpass that of phase one. Phases three and four would extend the line along Manhattan’s East side, all the way to the financial district at the Island’s Southern most point. These phases currently have no funding commitments or timelines.I guess the thing that gets me is that this subway line was first proposed in 1920, over 100 years ago. So, why has it taken so long to construct? Why is it costing so much? And what can we learn about public transit? Not only where the Second Avenue Project got it wrong, but where other places get it right. In New York city the subway is the lifeblood of the city. This is Sarah Kaufman. She’s the Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University At NYU I do research, I conduct events, and I teach mostly around the topic of transportation and technology. She’s also worked at the city’s transit agency itself. I previously worked at the MTA, which is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority here in New York, which is the organization responsible for New York subways and buses, as well as several bridges, tunnels, and highways. Before COVID the subway was handling about five and a half million people per day. And then we also have the largest bus system in the country. And before COVID, it was handling about 2 million people a day. New York City does not function without its subway and bus systems, because that is how everyone gets around. In a lot of US cities, the only people who take buses or trains are lower income people, but here in New York you could be sitting next to a multimillionaire or someone who is very low income and everyone’s riding it together. It’s a great equalizer. Today, the subways might be the city’s lifeblood, but a quarter century before the first trains began running underground, elevated trains rumbled above Manhattan’s busiest avenues.Archival audio: Gleaming skyscrapers are traditional landmarks of New York, but there are other landmarks like the grimy ribbon of steel [inaudible 00:06:37]. They were loud, dirty, and choked the city’s street life under a canopy of metal.Archival audio: For 76 years, L trains clattered by carrying people to work and home again. But the old steel skeleton outlived its usefulness. Passengers dwindled, and so the L is being torn down. The city began phasing out these elevated trains, known to New Yorkers at the time as the L because the more modern underground subway lines were being built. Well, most of them were being built anyway. So the first concept for the Second Avenue Subway was published in 1920. And it was just an idea. And the city planned to start construction in the early 1930s, but as you know, the depression hit. And so there was no funding for a new subway line. Once the country recovered...Archival audio: Second Avenue. Miles of new housing need miles of new track. Different capital project amounts went into repairs and other subway lines and so there wasn’t funding for this project. There were fits and starts over time in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s based on federal funding and state funding, as well as governance changes for the MTA itself.Archival audio: Much of the transportation future will be hidden below the ground in more than 50 miles of new subways. Soon, there will be a new two track subway that will run the length of Manhattan on Second Avenue, right up to the Bronx. The city did actually start construction in the early 1970s. However, New York City soon fell into severe economic and political turmoil, leading to high unemployment and rising crime.Archival audio: New York City Subway System. It has turned into a nightmare for the millions who ride it each day. The reason for the crime wave? The city says it doesn’t have the money to pay for transit police. Again, the Second Avenue Subway was put on the back burner. New York was left with several mini tunnels under Second Avenue, but nothing that connected and nothing that was yet able to have a train because these tunnels were not contiguous. The 1980s and ’90s saw the city crawl itself out of the fiscal hole and finally start to bring down the crime rate. In December 2001, just three months after the 9/11 attacks shook the city, research began on the impact of constructing the Second Avenue tunnels to the city and the environment. These impact statements were finished in 2004, and plans were developed for the next two years. So finally, construction resumed in the 2010s.Archival audio: We’re here today, starting up the tunnel boring machine, which you see behind me for the Second Avenue Subway. This is a tremendously exciting day. It was seen as a shovel ready project in the 2010s. A lot of it had to do with federal investment because this project was just too large for local or state investment to have completed. And so once there was a real federal commitment to transit, mostly thanks to Obama, the city was able to work on this project. That leads us to then Governor Cuomo’s grand opening gala. Unveiling a stretch of track from 63rd street to 96th street underneath Second Avenue.Archival audio: Thank you and God bless you. In a few minutes and we’re going have a great New Year. Thank you. So yes, nearly a hundred years later, the Second Avenue subway was eventually built. Well, one of four parts were built. And pre pandemic, the line saw around 200,000 weekday riders. That’s more than the entire Atlanta Rapid Transit System. So sure it’s doing its job, but then there’s the issue of cost. The Second Avenue subway was the most expensive subway built in the history of the world in mile-per-mile basis. The total cost was around $2.6 billion per mile. There’s a lot of great research done about construction costs in the US being just astronomically high. If you look at the work of Alon Levy... Okay, I found the sound recorder. My name Alon Levy. Alon Levy is a transit researcher. They run the websites, Pedestrian Observations, and the Transit Costs project. Alon’s interest in transit costs started when they were studying for their PhD in New York. I got an interest in the subway. It’s just a thing that people do in New York, they ride this train. And I saw, okay, this is how this system laid out and started thinking about maybe gaps in the system. What could we edit? What would we change? And somehow this has gone to trying to compare it with a lot of other big systems. And this is when I realized, just through a little bit of Googling, that the construction costs of subway construction in New York, the Second Avenue subway were very high. That led them to look at other subway projects. They checked a bunch of huge global cities. Alon found that the global average cost of transit projects was around 400 million dollars per mile. The Second Avenue project was six times that. This led them to start the Transit Costs Project. It’s a website that catalogs the costs of transit projects around the world. Right now we have a database, it’s something like 600 items. We have close to complete coverage of subways built in the last 20 or 25 years. The Second Avenue subway is extreme, both in timeline and cost, but it’s not unusual in the US for transit projects to fall behind schedule and go over budget. According to the Transit Costs Project, transit projects in the US are the sixth most expensive in the world. The countries that are one through five are New Zealand, Hong Kong, Qatar, Singapore and the UK respectively. However, there’s an important caveat to the data here. Digging tunnels and building underground rail, like a subway, make construction much more expensive than simply laying down rail over land. The five countries I listed are building projects that are more than 80% tunneled. New Zealand and Singapore’s projects are a hundred percent tunneled. In the US only 37% of track is tunneled. I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, I would say the US performs pretty badly. It’s not that it’s without any bright spots. There are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. This is Alex Forrest. I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. We met online several years ago, through Twitter, naturally. I immediately became a fan of his insight and how he communicates his ideas about transit As with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here. It’s hard to know where to start. Culprit one: labor costs. With our construction crews, we need them to be professional trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contracts or else, what are we doing here? Here’s Sarah Kaufman. As compared to most other countries that have transit systems, employers in the US have to pay out worker benefits, which significantly adds to the cost. Subway construction happening in France for example, the cost would be somewhat lower because the employer would not be responsible for the health and wellness of the workers. Culprit number two: practice. You know that old saying, “practice makes perfect”? The USA had a first rate best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century.Archival audio: And here’s one of the most wonderful things about this vast country of ours. No matter where we want to travel, there are trains. Beautiful, comfortable… At its peak in the early 20th century, the US had over a quarter million miles of railroad tracks. Nearly every major US city, from Atlanta to Los Angeles, had either street cars or subways that a majority of commuters took to work. For more reasons than we have time to get into in this episode, the latter half of the 20th century saw the tides begin to turn. At that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us where we are today. There’s no consistent new building of transit projects. And so everyone is all kind of out of practice. So when a new project does need to get underway, it’s like starting from square one every time. A lot of transit agencies in the US should be developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors the better you are just at the industry in general. The more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system is just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Culprit number three: transit agencies. Often in the US, a patchwork of different agencies all have different motives. Here in New York, and this is true in several other US cities. We have this division of jurisdictions that is hard fought. The subways and buses are run by one organization, the commuter rails, Metro North and Long Island Railroad another. Meanwhile, we have the path train, which is one of the commuter trains to New Jersey run by the Port Authority, and then New Jersey Transit, which runs other trains to New Jersey. It’s pretty incredible how many different organizations needs to come together. And frankly, they don’t. When you look at other countries, they have more of a regional and national perspective on coordinating interests across boundaries.  Lastly, perhaps the most guilty culprit: Us, the public. There’s that other old saying, time is money. Well, in the case of transit projects, the longer these things go on for, the more expensive they get. These delays are often a result of NIMBYs. People who favor projects in general, but when they happen near them, they say not in my backyard. We discussed NIMBY attitudes around new housing development in our previous episode. And the same issues can be seen when it comes to transit projects, too. We do have a public engagement process where people can oppose transit and here in the US, people wildly oppose transit. They do not want buses and subways coming to their neighborhoods and overwhelmingly they come to community meetings and oppose it. Whereas in other places, the community has less input because it’s seen as a community betterment project. And so that process, which can take years here, is a non-issue elsewhere. Residents will often weaponize regulations such as environmental protection laws in an attempt to stop what they see as an encroachment on their neighborhoods. People are loathed to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. Trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given projects, not the least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. All these factors add to transit costs in the US. Excessive labor costs, a lack of in-house planning expertise, multiple out of step transit agencies, and NIMBY’s dragging out project timelines.Part of the reason that Alon Levy started the Transit Cost Project was because they believed that if the US was able to look outside it’s borderers, the shared knowledge and learning from other global cities will help transit projects everywhere. Even New York. There’s this unfortunate tendency in New York to say, oh, New York, especially, you don’t have anything to learn from. So we don’t have anything to learn from to a degree. We don’t have anything to learn from Milan. We don’t have anything to learn from Stockholm. Every transit system has things it does well and things it can improve on. But the more I dove into the world of transit, the more I realize that all roads, or all railroads, lead to one place. Japan. This is the sound of Shinjuku station. It stretches for more than a half a mile through the Shinjuku ward and the heart of Tokyo. The area is a major commercial and administrative hub. Every day it sees 3.6 million passengers making it the busiest public transit center in the world.There are five railway and subway companies that intersect here. They link the Tokyo Metro to lines that service the suburbs West of the city. By one account, there are 53 platforms and over 200 entrances and exits to this massive complex. There’s also long distance bus service. While Shinjuku is the busiest station, it’s hardly alone. There are nearly a dozen other major transit hubs spread across various wards in Tokyo. Each of these services 1 to 3 million passengers daily. The rest of the world doesn’t even come close. Take New York’s Penn Station, the busiest train station in the entire Western hemisphere. It sees over 600,000 weekday passengers. That’s one sixth of Shinjuku station. In fact, of the 50 busiest train stations in the entire world, 45 are in Japan.Train ridership can only get to these high numbers when the system runs effectively. In fact, in Japan it’s nearly perfect. So desu ne. Hai, hai. This is Mr. Junichi Sugiyama. I live in Yokohama, Japan. He’s a journalist who writes about train, travel and business. And he’s ridden on every single rail system in Japan. Next I’d like to like to ride the Amtrack across the United States. I will practice my English to help with my travels. [in Japanese]Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Japanese people feel proud that the railroad system is so reliable and punctual, and when they can say there’s a train station close to where they live. Punctuality and accuracy is the most important thing so that people know exactly when to leave the house and when they will arrive at their destination. Let’s look at the Long Island Railroad, which operates out of Penn Station. The system considers a train on time if it arrives or departs within 5 minutes and fifty-nine seconds of the scheduled departure. Even with this generous measure, nearly 20,000 trains run late every year. Now contrast this to Tokyo. Every year the city’s entire system experiences accumulated delay of 20 seconds. Even these precious few seconds are an infraction worth an apology, like this statement that went viral in 2017.Archival audio: A company in Japan is apologizing after one of its trains left 20 seconds early. The company released a statement that reads in part, we deeply apologize for the severe inconvenience imposed upon our customers. That’s incredible. For comparison, to review [inaudible 00:24:28]. Imagine a trained company in the US making a formal public apology for leaving 20 seconds early.Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: By increasing the frequency of trains, it will be more convenient for residents in the area. And subsequently, the town will develop. Ultimately, the goal is to have an accurate and efficient operating system. Tokyo also manages to integrate its various train operators very well. Here’s Alon Levy. Tokyo has something very precious, which is that it manages to integrate urban and suburban transit very well. So the commuter rail lines in Tokyo run through the subway system and moreover the subway system was built to form a tight mesh within the city, but also connect with these commuter lines. So Tokyo essentially built a subway system at metropolitan scale. The system in Japan is not without its drawbacks. For example, in Tokyo the high number of competing transit companies leave riders paying with a jumble of different methods. But it’s efficient and on time, and the high quality of Japan’s transit system extends into the smallest details. Here’s Alex Forrest. There’s something much more every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies. It’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it.I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. If you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Clearly, the Japanese love their trains. And like so many love stories, it started in a time of war.Following its defeat in World War II, Japan was occupied by the American military. In Japan this is referred to as GHQ, or General Headquarters. Its aim was to establish democracy and rebuild the country [in Japanese]Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Prior to the war, the Japanese National Railways, or JNR for short, was built and operated by the federal government. But, when the war ended, JNR was relaunched by GHQ in order to make the railway system more sustainable. Converting it into a public enterprise.  The government operated railway became a government owned public corporation.Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: JNR incurred a large deficit of 37 trillion yen, which almost exceeded Japan’s national budget. On top of mounting debt, confrontation increased between management and the labor unions leading to numerous strikes. Fares were up, ridership was down. It all came to a head in 1987. [in Japanese]Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The country couldn’t support it anymore. So they made a drastic reform. All of this debt was settled and the private company was created. This was the beginning of the JR Group.The corporation was split into six private passenger companies. Each was designated a different region of the country. There was also a freight and research company created. Most of the JR Group companies were granted the freedom to operate as private entities. And so they made efforts to lure back passengers. [in Japanese]Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: From the perspective of the rider, the staff have become kinder. After becoming JR, they started to focus on service. Because it’s an independently profitable and private company, they felt that they had to make a profit. And in order to make a profit, a lot of customers have to feel comfortable and satisfied. So the employee education was reviewed and the service was improved. There was also a marketing push. One example is this now famous series of JR Group Christmas commercials in the late 1980s. The train companies were allowed to capture the upside of their own service. [in Japanese]Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: It was stipulated by law that the national railway should not actually do business beyond building and managing railways. They were told that they could not invest in hotels, real estate, or super markets, as it would put pressure on private companies. However, once JR became a private company, it was possible to expand into new businesses, such as hotels, ski resorts, and real estate.  And so JR Group companies had a larger financial stake in the areas around their train stations succeeding economically.Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The biggest business is to use stations to build shopping centers or condominiums. The station is not just a train station, but a base for business. It’s where people gather together. So you can have a lot of different businesses there. When Japanese railways developed, they bought a lot of land at a low price first, and later put down a railroad track and then the price of the land would go up. So they would sell it. Many urban railways in Japan have operated not only as railways, but also by diversified management. Today JR East, the JR Group company that operates through Tokyo is the largest, fully privatized passenger rail company in the world.  This method of assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future, which they call value capture nowadays. In fact, this is not that different from how railways in the US were built. However, there are several key differences. When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these inter urban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains. This was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation, and then you didn’t really care what happened next. That was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. And given his own background, Alex Forrest actually has a unique perspective on this. When I was born, my parents were still students and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Mishara.Once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a twenty to thirty minute walk and take the train two stops over to go to church. This train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, but it runs like eight car trains using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. At the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every 2 to 3 minutes. This is the first train that I ever rode. I moved out before I was even five years old.And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old. The stations were pretty grimy at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. The whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan and clean. From that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world. By the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America, or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. It’s now 2022 in New York.Archival audio: This is the 96th street train. The next stop is 72nd street. Stand clear. Closing doors. The first phase of the Second Avenue subway has been running for just over five years.Archival audio: Good afternoon. We certainly meet in the most unusual places here in New York. Very delighted to be here beneath the second avenue subway. Something that we’ve been talking about for a very long time... Governor Kathy Hochul has moved forward phase two of the project, largely thanks to president Biden’s $23 billion infrastructure investment and jobs act.Archival audio: Ladies and gentlemen, next stop 125th street. With that, I’d like to introduce a gentleman... And the investment will go even further at this time. While phase one served mainly a high wealth area, phase two will extend into East Harlem, a neighborhood, largely working class and highly reliant on public transit. According to the governor’s office, 70% of residents here use public transit to commute versus the citywide average of 55%. For the people along the next phase of Second Avenue, this development would be a huge life change. And that’s the thing. Transit is the type of infrastructure with the power to change people’s daily life. Whether in New York, or a city like Dallas, where I grew up. New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what’s the critical difference here, right? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. There are lots of problems in the New York subway, but just the fact of its availability, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population. You’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. In the end, I am perhaps foolishly optimistic about the prospects for a more transit oriented feature in the US. For one thing, young people are becoming more vocal about their desire for alternatives to driving. And as America continues to age, developing these alternatives will be increasingly important for seniors who don’t want to be relegated to their homes in their later years. I see bright spots like Cul-de-Sac, a new car-free city development being built in Tempe, Arizona and private companies like Brightline in Florida and Texas Central are also developing intercity rail projects in places that have long been deeply car-centric. I’m hoping we’ll see a lot more experimentation in the years to come. I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome, and it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here. It’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long. Even convincing people if they need to do things differently can be very difficult. America has a real addiction to cars and most of our communities are built around use of cars. And so it can be very hard to give up car usage, even if somebody tried. At the same time, I think that the younger generations in the US are seeing that and taking advantage of transit and biking and other options as better ways to get around. I hope that the interest in transit continues. Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak.

I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. We’ll see you next time. Welcome to  B-Sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. On the most recent episode of Beneath the Surface, we focused on the state of public transit in the US, and we compared it with one of the most train loving countries in the world: Japan. For this episode, I interviewed Alex Forrest. He is currently a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. I’ve been a fan and a friend of Alex’s for years. He’s cultivated a community of trained fanatics on Twitter…train Twitter that is, where he shares his thoughts on the state of train travel in places like the US and Japan, where he lived for several years as a child. His username is @380kmh, which might seem a bit random, but it’s the top design speed for most high speed trains.In our conversation, we discussed his current work in Springfield, the formative years he spent in Japan, the history of train development in the US, and more. So here is my conversation with Alex Forrest, which has been lightly edited. I hope you enjoy. So the first question is always the hardest. Introduce yourself. Tell me your title and why are we talking today? My name’s Alex Forrest. I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. And we are talking today about transit around the world and how to do it well. Tell me a little bit about your current work as a transit planner. When we were chatting about this episode a little bit, you told me that you just won funding for two lines. Is that right? Two bus routes, right. So my work in transit is limited to bus operations. That’s the transit provider that I work for, operates out of three bus garages in Western Mass, about 35 to 40 routes. It varies a little bit by time of year. And in the past couple years, I was able to win funding from MassDOT to operate two new services. Both are kind of longer range intercity kind of services. One of them runs on a roughly hourly frequency on the Interstate. The other is just a three times a day through a state highway connecting to Worcester, it’s a service that we’ve had a lot of interest in riders from. And I’m a little disappointed that we couldn’t provide more than just these three round trips, but it was great to be able to get that running. Talk to me about the transit situation broadly in Massachusetts, and also kind of how does the transit system in the broader north-east differ from the rest of the US? Massachusetts works nicely as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country in that you have Boston, which is our north-east, I suppose. And then you have the rest of the state, which I mean, the rest of the state was settled very early. So it doesn’t necessarily have the same town patterns that you’ll find in the rest of the country. But in terms of transit availability, I think it’s a working analogy, it does the trick, which is to say MBTA is the transit provider in Boston. They run four subway lines, one of which doubles as kind of a surface streetcar route. They run a myriad of bus lines, including some nominal BRT routes. They also run ferries and commuter rail around Eastern Massachusetts. So very extensive network. One of the top performing networks for ridership in the USA. There are also, I want to say, maybe 15 or so regional transit authorities elsewhere in the state.Most of which have sort of one central city and a defined service area. And their job is to provide exclusively bus operations. Now it’s not written in, but that’s just how it works out, throughout the other parts of the state, not a bad model conceptually, but one of the oversights of it is that they made no account for travel between the regional transit authorities, which is why this route to Worcester was such a big deal. I mean, in Eastern Mass, the various regional transit authorities at least can get close to Boston or connect to an MBTA service. But beyond Worcester, that starts to become impossible and broadly speaking, the RTAs obviously get a lot less money than the MBTA. They have much cheaper services to run in the first place, but one of the consequences of this is that very few...it might only be PVTA, which is the one that I work at, very few RTAs actually offer weekend service. Most of them only offer service on weekdays. I think until recently, that was the case, even in Worcestor, which would be the next largest after us. But you will want to look into that. I’m not sure, they might have started running weekend service recently. It’s kind of wild though. You said this is sort of a microcosm for the rest of the US. Talk to me about how you would rate the US public transit system kind of compared to other countries specifically in regards to rapid transit. And when you decide on a rating, I’m curious why the US merits that rating. I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, just because that is an admittedly pretty high bar, and so a lot of countries are still working on that or don’t really need to, I would say the US performs pretty badly. I don’t know about a out of 10 score and it’s not that it’s without any bright spots, but just there are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. As far as the analogy goes for Massachusetts, one of the issues is that transit is very much a localized affair. And so where it exists at all, you might have reasonable transit, but anywhere else as kind of a national system, it’s sorely lacking. So connections between city areas are probably the worst component in the USA. And then within cities, there are various other issues just concerning schedule availability.Like I talked about the no weekend service, that’s hardly unique to Massachusetts, it’s true all around the USA. Even some rail systems. I want to say the Los Angeles commuter rail, I’m not convinced they run on weekends, or if they do, most commuter rail systems which do run on weekends, offer greatly reduced service. So, they prioritize specifically the times when they think it’s most likely people will ride. Which again, that sounds very reasonable, but that’s not actually the best way to run a transit network and we have empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. So we don’t need to be led by assumptions there. To ask maybe a silly question, because there are theories that I can see, for example, for why this is the case. The US developed much later than its peers, the decision-making power to create transit, particularly between cities is kind of difficult to, I guess, manage because of our Federalist system. Why is our transit so lacking? As you kind of suggested, it’s definitely one of those path dependent problems. The system is lacking here just because we sort of evolved this way through various small decisions. But the part of the reason we’re lacking now is because we’re actually very, very far ahead of the curve, about a 100 years ago. And it’s not quite as simple as the success went to our heads and we thought nobody could do it better than us, and so if we can’t do it well, we don’t even need to bother. It’s not quite that simple, but that’s definitely part of it. And the USA had a first rate, best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. But even before that, even before the early 20th century, there were some fundamental problems in how we developed our system.And those problems led to complications when the original developers of railways and local transit networks in America started to run into cost issues, not entirely just because of a lack of business, but also because they were hamstrung in their ability to set their own fares. A lot of municipal ordinances would require transit providers to operate a flat fare across an entire region, which is not best practice. You really want to charge by distance traveled. And also, that flat fare was limited. At the time, I think it was a nickel or a dime, just because we’re talking about the 1920s, ’50s here. The inability to raise fares to deal with drops in revenue kind of ensured that the old railway operators couldn’t survive and a handover would be necessary. So then we get to kind of step two, which is the mid-20th century handover when a lot of the trolley companies were replaced by bus companies and the intercity private railways got out of the passenger business entirely with the formation of Amtrak.And so at that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us to where we are today. There have been various attempts, no shortage of money spent, although at the same time, kind of not enough, it’s complicated. I guess you could say they spent the money on not the best things for keeping the system going. And even to this day, a lot of baked in costs like that, just from the way we’ve done things so far. I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome. And it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here, it’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long, even convincing people they need to do things differently can be very difficult. It’s funny, if we were re-cutting a trailer for the podcast today, most of what you just said would be kind of a prime target for it, because I think this is kind of the crux of creating infrastructure. From the outside, as I’ve been talking to people, whether they’re building new cities, so talking about kind of what is it about Lagos that would necessitate a new city? Or for example, the Salton Sea and its potential to be kind of a lithium mine, it’s interesting. There isn’t kind of one culprit for why things aren’t better than they are or why some things worked. It really does appear to be kind of pack dependence in inertia all the way down.And you add into that, infrastructure typically doesn’t have...it needs a policy entrepreneur, but it’s very difficult to kind of just make large scale changes even when we know what it is we need to do. And I guess speaking of cost, you kind of mentioned this in your last answer. I’m curious, if you could elaborate, in your experience, why are transit costs in the US so much more expensive and why does it take so much longer to develop transit in the US than in other similarly situated countries? Before I get started, I want to just break down the two main sides of cost in transit. One being the operating expense, just to pay the drivers, maintain the vehicles, keep the service on the road. And then the other being capital expense, which would be to replace the vehicles, get new ones to build any stations, garages, any kind of train service requires capital expense on its track. Both are more expensive in the USA, but the operating costs are, I would say, a lot more defensible by and large. They’re not perfectly defensible. There’s some problems there too. Really, it is the capital costs that are the biggest problem. It’s the large infrastructure projects. Those are the ones where the costs are just wildly inflated. And again, as with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here, it’s hard to know where to start.There is the kind of NIMBY angle where people are loath to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. So it’s trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given project, not least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Part of it has to do with staffing and what, I guess, I can only call unrealistic agreements with labor. Which, again, this comes back to the inertia thing, it’s obviously critical that we have well paid and compensated drivers for any of our vehicles. You don’t want people crashing on the road.And likewise with our construction crews, we need them to be professional, trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contract. What are we doing here? This is a problem that Japan had a crisis with in the late ’70s to 1980s, which ultimately led to the privatization of their national railways. There were various causes, it boiled down to a labor dispute and they were able to work it out and solve that issue back then. So yes, in the USA, right, we have just regulations. People’s ability to interfere with the project can ramp up the cost tremendously. We have relatively expensive labor, not even the expensive labor is the issue, but the overstaffing, where you just have way more people on a crew than you particularly need to do it.This also shows up in transit operations where you might have...the practice of having conductors on a train to pick up tickets is definitely not the way they do it in Japan, for example, where either if a train line is so quiet that you can’t just have fare gates at the station, then the driver of the train will check the tickets instead of having another guy wander around to do it, needless to say, those are only on the quieter rural lines. So I guess that’s only two subjects right now. There are more, I don’t even want to get started on the EBA and requirements for environmental impact statements, which, again, depending on how zealously the jurisdiction wants to push the issue, they can take years, if not...I don’t think any have taken more than a decade. Well, speaking of a transit project that took more than a decade, this episode begins with the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, which was first proposed, I believe, in a little over a 100 years ago. I wonder, are there other transit projects you can think of in the US that have similarly been extremely, exorbitantly expensive and also taken forever just to get off the ground? Yes. I think, frankly, you would’ve a much harder time finding projects for which that isn’t the case. I know that just recently in Boston, there’s a lot of celebration as a extension of the Green Line into Somerville, Mass opened. This goes to Union Square in Somerville, which is very close to where I lived in the mid ‘90s, living just on the border of Somerville and Cambridge. So it’s very heartening to think that finally, my old neighborhood has its own stop. I don’t remember the exact year, but I do remember when this project was being discussed back in at least 2004, if not earlier, I think versions of it have been on the drawing board since at least the 1940s. This particular round was finally authorized and it began construction sometime around also 2004, I want to say. And it was originally slated to open in 2011.So here we are now, it’s part open. There’s still more of it to open, which I think will open later this year, but they haven’t even finished opening it yet. And I’m as happy as the next guy that it’s finally here, but well over budget. I mentioned neighbors getting involved to just jack up the costs. Sometimes that does produce nice fruits, even if it does inflate the cost significantly. In this case, it involved connecting to a multi-use bike path, which branched off the Green Line Extension. There was already a bike path branching off it. They just wanted to run the bike path parallel to this new extension and connect it into the larger city bike network. A nice addition, but again, not strictly related to this project, did not need to get bundled in, inflated the timelines and the planning process, led to constant revisions. And so finally, here we are, halfway through 2022 and we’re not even done opening it. By Second Avenue Subway standards, that’s actually very, very impressive. But, of course, we are grading on the world’s biggest curve. Alex, I’ve known you for a few years and you have kind an unusual story with how you came into transit. Tell me a little bit about your unusual childhood and why you got so interested in transit in the first place. When I was born, my parents were still students and they were still kind of moving around quite a bit and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. This was in 1991, and I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Machida. And I would describe Machida as on one hand, very much a suburb, outside the city proper, mostly single family housing, but also, it has nearly half a million residents right now. And it’s got its fair share of large buildings as well. So it’s a suburb, but a Tokyo suburb, to be clear. Anyway, living out there for two years, I was about old enough to go to preschool. I attended a preschool a short walk from my parents’ apartment, but every week, once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a 20 to 30 minute walk, shorter on a bike or a bus, and take the train two stops over to go to church.And so this train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, it’s far out in the suburbs, I don’t know, maybe 15 miles away from Tokyo, I’m not sure. But it runs eight car trains, using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. And that’s where the local stops at the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every two to three minutes. So to have this out in the suburbs, this beautiful train, this is the first train that I ever rode, of course. And so if you look at Japanese culture, there’s certainly a carve out for the train nerds. They’re generally photographers. They like to take photos of trains and they know everything about them. I can see why kids growing up there would do that because the same effect hit me.The only difficulty was I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride. I was so happy. I didn’t have to abandon trains forever. The downside was they were American trains and that did not at all dim my enthusiasm as a five-year-old, six-year-old kid. I still loved riding them, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board.They were clearly very old, the stations were pretty grimy, at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. Just in general, the whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan, and clean. So anyway, just from that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world, just always taking the chance to ride it whenever I can. But by the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. It’s so crazy because the way you talk about Japan, I literally thought you had grown up there for many, many years. It’s amazing that all it took was two years and two of the most formative years in your childhood for you to kind of catch the train bug. Right. Well, and I have siblings as well and they didn’t quite catch the bug either. So it certainly depends on the person, but it was, I guess...you said it best, it was a very formative time in my life. And so those at the stage when I was just beginning to form memories, so basically, my earliest memories are of living in Japan, but I was also not so young that the whole thing was a blur. I had pretty concrete memories, for instance, of our trip on the last day when we were heading to Narita Airport, I remember the train we were on because it had a nice LED animated map showing the route we were going. And so I was just mesmerized, I could check off every station as we stopped on it and see the train in advance. You mentioned that you could clearly see, even at that age, the differences between US trains and Japanese trains. In your opinion, what are some of the main, maybe social and cultural differences that affect kind of how the US and Japan treat public transit? I think Japan has a reputation for very good manners and that’s incredibly well-deserved. In general, Japanese people are just very polite and they’re very social in public. They’re not going to make a mess in general or make a lot of noise or have a loud conversation, which is just kind of broadly refreshing, but hard to really imitate here. As far as kind of attitudes, social and cultural attitudes, there’s also sort of the impression that...and I mean, it helps to be on the cutting edge of the technology to do this, but there’s something much more glamorous and just every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies, it’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. Part of the reason that any reformers had any leverage here was that the public expected and demanded better service of the railways than they were delivering at that time. I’m hard pressed to come up with any more...you’ve heard the saying, "Why take a shower? I’ll just get dirty again." When, in fact, the point of taking a shower is precisely because you will get dirty again, so you want to be clean until that happens. I feel like that is kind of the attitude just as far as general maintenance goes. When I’m in Japan...I was visiting some years ago, I went to my old train station and they just had a guy...he was a part-timer apparently, but this is a very common thing there. They just had a guy walking up and down the staircases at the train station, just wiping down the banisters and walls, in the middle of the afternoon, it was 2:00 PM.He looked like he might have even been a retiree, which is why I gathered he was a part-time worker because senior citizens will often end up taking just odd jobs like that. But the fact that they actually have a position for this, you’re the guy who just wipes the station down every few minutes or so during the afternoon, they probably have another guy for the evening. But that kind of constant maintenance, much more so than people’s cultural inclination not to litter, is what makes the difference there.I feel like despite the well-deserved reputation for manners in Japan, people also tend to forget that they’re just human. People absolutely do litter there and they’ll leave things behind just out of forgetfulness, of course. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning.Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. Just if you care about the details, the details work themselves out. There’s something kind of interesting too. I don’t know the extent to which Japanese people just care more about their services, but it does seem like they expect more of their services than maybe we do. You can see those differences, we don’t have to just look at Japan and the US, even in say Dallas, where I grew up, and New York, where I live now, in Dallas, it’s expected that you really only ride the light rail if you need it as a connection downtown, let’s say you work downtown or just, if you can’t afford your own private transit, whereas in New York, I wouldn’t say it’s like Japan in that it’s totally ubiquitous, but it’s pretty ubiquitous, right? It’s not unusual to see people of very different kind of socioeconomic statuses riding the train together. And so even in the US, you can kind of see, and people in New York, of course, are accustomed to, and sort of demand much more. New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what is the critical difference here? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. And as you said, it’s not necessarily as useful and ubiquitous as in Tokyo, although certainly, it comes closer than anywhere else in America. And it’s also, certainly not as well-maintained as what you have in Tokyo. There are lots of problems with the New York Subway, but just the fact of its availability. As terrible as these trains are, as dirty or as overheated or whatever the problem is, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it.And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population, you’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Whenever a new bus route wants to get proposed, you’ll usually have some interested party who says, "Ah, we need bus service here. There’s a lot of jobs here. There’s a lot of houses here." And generally, in this assumption is not just that there’s a lot of jobs or houses, but, "There’s a lot of low income houses here. We need a bus here." "Oh, there’s a benefit center here. We need a bus to go there."And so if you have a bus line that only goes between those two places, between the low income apartments and the Social Security offices, that doesn’t particularly do a good job of addressing the needs of people in those apartments or those offices, let alone anybody else. The people in those apartments also need to go to the doctor. They also need to go to the grocery store. They also would like to visit friends. These are all trip purposes that are being completely ignored in the calculus of where to put the bus and you can solve all these issues if you just stop thinking of, "Ah, we only need to worry about these particular people who are going to ride." No, you have to think about anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. I love that tagline. If there’s a person, there’s a potential rider. I want to talk about Japan a little bit more. Can you explain sort of briefly...although I don’t know if this is a brief kind of question, how Japanese rail companies operate as private companies? You’ve mentioned this earlier, but specifically around real estate speculation and development. It’s actually not that different, at least superficially, from how a lot of the railways in the USA were built up. Although there are, I think, a couple of critical differences that I hope I can get to, but the premise of the land use speculation really was something that happened around the time that the cities were still growing. And the railway industry was still pretty new in Japan, but you had suburban streetcar operators in say early 1900s Tokyo and Osaka. Some of which became quite successful and began running what in America, we would call interurban lines, which are not mainline freight, but they basically have the same standards in terms of their heavy rail operations. Generally running electricity, even for the USA back then in the 1900s. But in America, the interurbans all ultimately got shut down more or less, a few survivors, modern transit lines.But in Japan, a lot of them were founded as private companies. Most of them were able to stay as private companies and gradually phased away from streetcar operations to focus on their interurban lines, which over the years, were extended, branches were added, through service onto the subways was added. And so these interurban lines evolved into modern suburban rail. These are for companies that remain private the entire time. Japan also had a national railway industry, which originated as an amalgam of government funded lines and privately built lines, was run by the Imperial Japanese government through the war, and then by the reconstruction government after the war, and which was ultimately privatized in 1987 and broken up into several subsidiary companies. So the premise is you build a line out of the city, you develop the land around that line and therefore you plant passengers for yourself who will then use your line to go back and forth to the city.This is indeed how a lot of rail in America got built too, at least at the commuter level, not necessarily at the intercity level, but one of the most critical differences that a lot of people who are interested in this method, which they call value capture nowadays, assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future. When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these interurban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales.Cannot emphasize this enough. If you look at a suburban operator in Japan, yes, they are invested in land use. Yes, they do take steps to make sure that their own ridership will be there, but that’s not the part which makes them the money. That’s just the background work. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains or buses. And this was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation and then you didn’t really care what happened next. You’d have a success where they take over the company. And that was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. And so, I think, that at least was part of why you had these interurban operators and streetcar operators in America running into trouble.I don’t mean to say it’s entirely their fault either. We cannot underestimate the impact of having tons of cars on the road, since a lot of American transit operators didn’t have dedicated rights of way, and so they’d be slowed down by anything that got in their path. But that’s also to say, I don’t want people to think it was entirely the evil car companies that did this. There were some really serious structural problems with American railway operators, which really doomed their efforts in the passenger rail business. Might have been overcome, but would not have come from the railways themselves, I don’t think. You would’ve needed a government intervention, which was a very, very tough sell and remains that to this day. That’s kind of the natural next question for me. So you say you might have an operator in kind of a regional line or a smaller line. Yes, they might invest in land and they might be speculating, but that’s really not where they make their money. How does that model compare to how transit agencies across the US are expected to function? Are there any US agencies that work like that? I don’t know if you could say there are any agencies that work like that, but there are, at least recently, some prominent private railway companies that have started operation. There’s Brightline in Florida, which is a private intercity railway line, which is, as far as I know, doing its best to develop the areas around its stations. You may be familiar with the term transit oriented development. Anyway, Brightline has taken advantage of value capture and TOD to build up its station areas. This is why they’re so interested in Miami and making sure their station location is close to downtown. Unlike the Amtrak Station, which is more peripheral. I know that Brightline is attempting to add a high speed line to Vegas from near LA. I’m not sure where that project stands. I just know that many operators have tried to do that route and the latest ones to step up to the plate are Brightline, so I wish them the best. The other one is actually a Japanese venture in America, where one of the companies that resulted from the breakup of the Japanese national railways is currently invested in developing a high speed railway line in Texas, between Dallas and Houston. In America, this is called the Texas Central Railway. It’s a subsidiary or partner company for the Central Japan Railway, which operates the busiest high speed line in Japan. The one from Tokyo to Osaka. And generally, as operations are, rural operations in Central Japan and commuter metropolitan operations around Nagoya, Japan’s third city. That’s one I’ve been hearing about for years. I didn’t realize it was a Japanese company behind that, which gives me a lot of hope for it. That has definitely improved my impression of the project as well. At the very least, I understand that the people who are working on it are technically very knowledgeable with literal decades of experience running the busiest high-speed railway in the world, whether or not that will be able to translate to Texas is still kind of anyone’s guess. But I don’t think you could find a better crew to do the job ultimately. Tell me, what do you think are the lessons and learnings for the US, as you kind of think back to your own experiences in Japan, and then now as a transit planner yourself, what do you think that US cities should aim to learn from the way that many Japanese cities operate transit? As far as learning from Japan, I’d already mentioned about planning for a general population. That’s pretty critical, but just as far as operations go, I think I would encourage them to not give up on the concept of farebox recovery. Even the most ardent transit advocates in America will frequently drop the line that there’s no transportation service that pays for itself. And this is where the reference to the Japanese providers, not only making their money from value capture is very important because usually the people who say that no system is profitable, will bring up the value capture argument to hand wave Japan’s example away, but that’s literally not true. A lot of these are publicly traded companies. You can look up their books and see where they’re getting their money from. I’d make a point to check the Odakyu Fact Book whenever they update it, which is once a year, that’s the line that I used to ride when I was a kid in the suburbs there.So we can confirm that it is indeed possible to make more than 100% of your operating costs from your fares. And the question is just, how do you do this? And there are so many ways to approach this that just don’t even get entertained because in America, they don’t think it’s an ideal worth pursuing. They don’t think there’s any finish line to that race. They think if you start focusing on your farebox recovery, you’ll never hit a 100%. You’ll waste a lot of time. You’ll have to make austere cuts on anything that isn’t profitable immediately. That’s really not how this works, really. If you’re only making 10% of your budget from fares, think about what you can do to get that to 20%. That’s not much, you don’t need to raise your fares necessarily, right? You might just need to change your fare structure.You might offer a discount on passes, which gets people to buy passes more often, which gets them to use the system more often. And then, hey, they don’t always have a pass or they might not ride the pass as much as the pass is paying for. And so you’re still making more money than if they never rode at all, right? Put it like this. If you buy a monthly pass for $50 and $50 pays for, let’s say, 30 trips on the bus, and you only use that monthly pass 20 times, transit operators has made a lot more money off those 20 trips than if they were all sold individually.And so, little steps that can be taken to improve farebox recovery. It’s not just about raising revenue, it’s also about reducing your costs. Obviously, you don’t need to change your fares at all if you can come up with a way to bring your operating costs down by, say, 5%, right? Again, it’s just that they don’t even entertain the idea that you could ever hit 100% profitability that they won’t take the smallest step in that direction. On the contrary, a lot of providers are talking now about trying to go fare free, which I admire where that’s coming from, but I can’t say that that would work out very well for us, even in the medium-term, let alone the long-term. It’s interesting because in the same way that a lot of the challenges that you see in infrastructure are not things that have a single cause, similarly, if you wanted to kind of fix sort of broken systems or even systems that are just operating suboptimally in some regard, these little changes...I wouldn’t necessarily think, "Oh, if you’re making 10% of your operating costs, maybe try and make 20 in revenue." That seems very doable. And I guess, as you look across the United States, do you see pockets of optimism? Yes. Not the least of which is my own local situation. It was nice to get a couple of routes approved. One of them’s doing badly, one of them’s doing well, but both of those were what I expected when I went into this. So I guess just things are going as expected there. Tell me again, just what did you get approved? And congratulations by the way. Oh, thank you. Thank you. And I should emphasize, I did not work on these grant proposals alone at all. So I had the collaboration of my great coworker over at PVTA, the director of planning over there. But one of the routes was a thrice per day, five days a week weekend-focused service, connecting Amherst, Mass. and Worcester Mass. The other is a roughly hourly to half hourly service along Interstate 91, between Northampton, Holyoke, at the Holyoke Mall and Downtown Springfield. Like I said a minute ago, the Springfield one has been a success.The Worcester one, not so much, but both are extremely well received. And the shortcomings of the Worcester route, I was well aware of when I went into designing the schedule with the very limited funds that were on the table. We, again, at the end of the day, only provide as much as people pay for, which is one of the reasons I think it’s so important that transit providers try to maximize their farebox revenue because the more your riders are paying for you to exist, the more you will be responding to the needs of your riders in continuing to exist.When you get all of your budget from state allocations, taxpayer funding, that money is just as good as any other money. The problem is that you have to address the concerns of the people giving it to you in order to get it. And their concerns may or may not line up with the actual interests of riders. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. The more of your money is coming from riders, the less likely you are to get paid to do something you wish you wouldn’t do, which happens all the time, I got to say. It’s a bit of a principal-agent problem. If the money isn’t coming from people that are actually using the service, it may or may not be useful. Right. Essentially, you’ll always reflect the priorities of whoever’s paying you to do your job. You want those priorities to line up with the users of your service, ideally, but as far as pockets of optimism, there are a lot. I think the thing which has had my attention the most in the past few years has been this phenomenon of bus network rationalizations. There’s a well regarded transit planner called Jarrett Walker who runs a private consulting firm, which I would say specializes in these network redesigns. Some of the fruits have been great. One of the first cities they went at was Houston. I know they’ve also done work in at least Miami, I want to say Seattle, and I want to say Rhode Island as well, at one point, or they might be doing Rhode Island now. I don’t quite recall, but these redesigns, essentially, they aim to have a cost neutral redeployment of existing resources.So you have X number of buses. You can pay X number of driver hours and X amount of fuel. Could you, just by changing where the buses are running, get a more effective system? Focusing on allowing people to transfer outside the central hub, as well as the central hub. Having services more frequent on more routes, even if that means having slightly fewer routes. The routes that you have will be higher quality. They’ll more consistently attract people to them because they’re more useful. And so this tendency doesn’t seem to be losing any steam. More and more cities are picking it up. The results have been very good where they’ve been attempted. This was pre-COVID, so I don’t know what happened after that, unfortunately, but pre-COVID, I do remember that any articles that would decry the general crisis of transit ridership in America would have to overlook Houston, which despite being a generally bus network, was actually improving its ridership at that time, while most of the country was struggling and losing ridership year after year, and it hadn’t been doing so before the redesign.So something clicked there and I want more cities to get this opportunity. I’ve taken a crack at it in my spare time, looking at our local network, but I don’t know. I feel like I’m maybe a little too in the weeds to do a good job. I’m already too accustomed to the usual special demands, special concessions, that I can’t quite bring myself to say, "Ah, well, rationally speaking, we shouldn’t do that." I know these guys too well, they’ll come yelling at me the next week if I mess it up. So it can be nice to have some outside eyes looking at it. At the same time, I think another thing that a lot of transit agencies in the US should be prioritizing more and some of them are, and doing a very good job at it, is developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors, the better you are just at the industry in general, some of these Japanese suburban railway companies, one of them in particular, happens to also be one of the largest manufacturers of rail cars in Japan. So they make trains for themselves, but also for other companies in Japan and also around the world. Again, just the more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system. It’s just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Alex, this has been honestly a delight. It’s crazy, I’ve known you for years, but I feel like I’m just meeting you again for the first time. It’s really wonderful to know that there are people working, not just in kind of the big transit systems, like in New York or in WMATA, in DC, but also in places like Springfield. And I appreciate so much that you gave us your time. No, thank you again so much for having me. It’s been a pleasure. It was great to catch up. We should definitely talk again soon. is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak.

Why you eating a mint, baby?So I can kiss you on the face.Because it’s National Night. That’s an ad for Mentos, the breath mint. It’s also kind of an ad for Singapore. It was launched in 2012 to coincide with Singapore’s National Day. I’m talking about making a baby, baby. You ready? Let’s go. National Day is celebrated on August 9th, the day that Singapore gained independence after separating from Malaysia. Traditionally, it’s marked by fireworks, official speeches and a massive parade.Ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome our cabinet ministers, senior ministers and deputy prime minister to The Float @ Marina Bay.Here come our cabinet ministers streaming into the… Dignitaries wave flags and the prime minister gives a National Day address, a little bit like the State of the Union in the US. In fact, in 2012, the same year as the Mentos ad, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed Singapore’s falling birth rates in his address.
      But alas, we are having too few babies and therefore we have a problem. The long-term trend is down, but we cannot give up. We’ve got to do something about it. Married couples are having fewer children. On average, now, each married woman has two kids. Previously, it was more, so this number has also been coming down. So, Mentos to the rescue? It’s National Night. Let’s make Singapore’s birth rate spike.Birth rate ain’t going to spike itself. Singapore’s population, it needs some increasing. In the US, we aren’t used to ads like that, or to hearing politicians talk about these issues in the way that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong does, even though similar trends are at work here. The birth rate in the United States is also falling. Personally, I’ve always been drawn to these questions about populations. Birth rates, changes in the age of a population and what those numbers might mean. It always felt like a natural fascination to me.See, I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean large. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you I don’t even know precisely how many cousins I have, and that’s just first cousins. Who knows how many second or third cousins I’ve got running around out there?And even though I haven’t  all of my cousins yet—they’re scattered across a few continents—I feel extremely fortunate to have an international support system that spans generations.I also want to have my own kids someday. And by the standards of most people my age, I want to have a lot of kids. But of course, the decision to have children is intensely personal. It’s also one that governments around the world try to influence in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So I wanted to understand what impact these kinds of personal decisions can have at scale, and why governments have so often tried to influence their citizens when it comes to having children.Hello and welcome to , a podcast series from Stripe Press, exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. So far on the podcast, we’ve looked at a lot of physical infrastructure: housing, transportation, cities, container ships. But why do we need all this infrastructure in the first place? People. It all comes down to people. So, in this episode, we’re looking at how a country’s population, its size, its growth or lack of growth, are perhaps the most critical infrastructure. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about populations. What happens when governments try to influence population growth and size through policy?Countries around the world put policies in place that influence their citizens’ reproductive choices. The United Nations Department of World Economic and Social Affairs keeps track of these policies. In 2021, their report listed 143 governments with fertility policies intended to either raise, lower or maintain population size. For example, Kenya has had government-led efforts to slow population growth since the 1960s. These programs, which began by providing basic contraception and family-planning information, evolved into healthcare systems for mothers and infants.By contrast, Hungary has recently made headlines for a distinctly different goal. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has spoken openly about wanting to raise Hungary’s birth rate, which is among the lowest in Europe. In 2015, the Family Housing Allowance Program created subsidies that increased based on whether a couple was married and how many children they had. The most benefits were available to married couples with three or more children. But Hungary has actually had policies in place to raise birth rates since the late 1940s.One country that has tried to both speed up and slow down its population growth through policy is Singapore, first by discouraging citizens from having large families and now by pursuing pro-fertility policies. So with that Mentos ad still ringing in my ears, I set out to understand what it was like to live with these ever-changing policies. How did people having kids in Singapore experience their government’s evolving attitudes towards procreation? My name is Titus. I’m 69 years old now. I have been in the government service for 25 years with the Housing and Development Board in Singapore. So that’s a little bit about me, and my wife and I, we have three children. I’m Vimala and I’ve been a teacher all my life, taught for about 30 years, 35 years. We’re both born in Singapore and we have lived here for all our lives. Titus and Vimala have seen both sides of Singapore’s policy on family planning. We lived through the times when we had this policy of “Stop-at-Two” family planning. After World War II, Singapore’s population was rising rapidly, much faster than its economy was developing. Even the introduction of family planning in the 1940s didn’t slow it down. In 1950, the population was barely more than one million. But by the time of independence in 1965, it was almost 1.9 million, close to double. Add to that, Singapore is a tiny island nation. It’s just 281 square miles. For comparison, the city of Los Angeles is about 500 square miles. A booming population, little room for expansion. So by the early 1970s, the government took action. You know, during our teenage years, I think the Stop-at-Two policy started somewhere the early ’70s. And we were our teenage years at that time. No, it was early twenties. In our twenties, sorry. We were in our twenties at that time. That’s the purpose of the policy, to reeducate you on what is right and then what is wrong. I thought it was quite intuitive as well. One child, the child will be lonely. Two children, okay, he’s got a playmate. Three, if some mistakes are made then you have three. The Stop-at-Two policy, a combination of incentives and disincentives for families. We got married in 1980. So my first child was born in ‘81, and after I gave birth immediately, I think the next day, the nurse comes to me and asks me, "What plans do you have for family planning?" So it was very strict at that time, and they wanted us to keep at two. So if you stopped at two, you had a lot of incentives. Like, they got us at places where it mattered a lot to us, which was the housing and health. If you had two children, both the children would get X number of dollars in school for them. But if you had a third child, then the third child would have nothing, that sort of thing. So you had to fund it yourself. Along with the policies came an aggressive PR campaign. Maybe it was kind of a propaganda. There were campaigns, and very sadly, you’re told, "Two is enough," and "Because of two, you get X number of things." And so after a while, and we were young at that time, maybe in our late teens, early twenties, and then you start to see that, eh, it makes sense. Actually, I remember this poster very, very vividly in my mind with the father, mother and two daughters. And they say, "Boy or girl, two is enough." And those posters were inescapable. Once you have a government policy, the posters are everywhere, in government offices. Public places, bus stops. Yeah. Malls, everywhere. They just have different versions of it, but the idea is the same. Some other posters from the time directly promoted more drastic measures like sterilization, calling it "the best method for family limitation." So if you stopped at two and if you sterilized yourself, the lady, she could get the best school for her child, whichever school she wanted for her child. And also the family could stay in some of the better areas in Singapore. So it was a very serious thing then, and most people adhered to that policy of "keep at two." Some of the ladies, actually, were sterilized, though of course, they took the more drastic action to stop at two. Many years later, when the government started encouraging people to have more children, there were some bad feelings that, "You had actually prevented me from having more children and now you’re telling me to have more children." So there were some of these undercurrents. So the Stop-at-Two policy in Singapore was more than just economic. Sterilizations took place on a mass scale with a peak of more than 10,000 procedures carried out in 1976. The Stop-at-Two policy was far from the only effort to limit population growth in developing countries. China’s one-child policy, which was put in place in 1980, is probably the most well known, but countries like India also put similar policies in place as far back as the early 1950s. But these kinds of policies often came at a heavy cost. One that has disproportionately impacted women. In Singapore, mothers, afraid they might be unable to bear the costs of a third child, were forced to make permanent, life-altering choices about their bodies.This was also the case on a much larger scale in China. Millions of women were sterilized as part of the government’s efforts at population control. Others were forced to undergo abortions. In some rural areas where there was a long-standing preference for male children, female infants were abandoned. And as a result, in China today it’s estimated that there are nearly 35 million more men than women.In economically-developed countries, the notion of having fewer children by choice gained traction, starting in the late 1960s, sometimes with an environmental argument attached. This anxiety about the world’s growing population was in large part because of one extremely popular book written by a husband-and-wife team. It was about 10 years ago this month that Dr. Paul Ehrlich made his first appearance on the Tonight Show, and it elicited probably more mail than any guest at that time we have ever had on a show. It had to do with his book, , and it was a major factor in launching the ZPG, which is zero population growth in this country. And since that show, he’s done about 25 shows with us., coauthored by Paul and Anne Ehrlich, was a sensation. Published in 1968, it predicted famine, drought and mass death due to overpopulation, all within the next 20 years. These ideas weren’t entirely new. Economist Thomas Malthus made a similar case in his 1798 book, _An Essay on the Principle of Populatio_n. But it was Ehrlich’s writing that brought these concepts to a broad, contemporary audience. Some paperback copies of  carried the typewritten warning, "While you are reading these words, four people will have died from starvation, most of them, children." Ehrlich’s argument, "Let’s make sure that the existing population cannot just survive but thrive before worrying about adding more people to the planet." Here he is in 1980. We have a little over four billion today. Large numbers of them are undernourished. We don’t have enough energy to go around. People think the environment is deteriorating and so on. Why don’t we try doing a really good job with four billion people, see if we can do that? The legacy of this book, for better or for worse, lives on today. In 2019, a statement on the need for climate action, endorsed by over 11,000 scientists, was published in the Journal of Bioscience. One of the statements’ recommendations: stop global population growth. Now, the methods of population limitation proposed in this statement were mainly about personal choice, like increasing access to family planning services. They were not advocating restrictive government policies, but the anxieties that Ehrlich brought to mainstream attention are present. So I wanted to know, what is the state of population growth like today? I called up Clara Piano. Alright. So my name is Clara Piano. I am currently an assistant professor of quantitative analysis at Samford University. My area of research is family economics, although I’ve also published in the history of economic thought and the economics of religion. In addition to being an expert on family economics, when we talked, she was also about to become a mom. Yes, yes. I am eight months along with our first. She’s a little girl, and it has convinced me that no one is ever ready. I just really do feel like it’s been a privilege to not only be researching what I find most interesting, which is how families form and function and interact with society, but to be living it right now as well. So I asked her: is the world’s population still growing? The world’s population is increasing, although much less than it was in the past. World population growth reached a peak in the 1960s. Since then, it has fallen. And within the next 100 years, the world’s population is actually projected to shrink.Researchers like Clara are keeping a close eye on these global trends because unlike Erlich, they see potential in a growing population. When we talked, she referenced the work of economist Julian Simon. As Julian Simon would say, the ultimate resource is people. And of course, there are values of people beyond economics. I want to acknowledge that completely, and he does as well in his work. But basically, it comes down to the fact that people are not only hands. They also have brains and they have ideas, and population growth, even from the economic perspective, is not just a replication process but a diversification process. So the people who are being born now are going to have different ideas of how to do things that will generate technological progress, which is actually the source of economic growth. This is another view of population growth also captured by economist Michael Kremer in his 1990 paper, Population Growth and Technological Change. The paper is worth reading in full, but the takeaway is that as populations increase, so does technological advancement, which in turn increases economic growth, and more concretely, raises living standards.So population growth can possibly be a key to solving the existential challenges that Erlich described: like food and energy scarcity, and climate change. The theory goes, if there are more people out there trying to solve big problems, more possible solutions can be found. You live in New York City, right? That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, where ideas multiply. That’s what we really need. That’s Shruti Rajagopalan. I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emergent Ventures grants program also at Mercatus. I’m a fellow of the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU Law School because, in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. Her research on developing economies is rooted in India, a country with a massive and growing population. So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of a hard number to even imagine. The United States, for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people. So the Indian population is 18% of the world. India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country in the world within the next decade. While a growing population can put stress on a nation’s infrastructure, Shruti sees India’s numbers as one of its greatest assets. India already has the resources of a large number of people. Now we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other. The ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce, globally, is going to be Indian. But not all countries are growing so rapidly, and some aren’t growing at all. So the fundamental question remains: how to ensure that people can have the number of children they want to have. Here’s Clara Piano. So this is the billion-dollar question. There is an element of mystery about all of this, in terms of the declining populations around the world. However, there are some things that we know. We do know that as people have become more educated, particularly women, we see lower fertility, and this could be a variety of reasons. Some people think it’s better knowledge about family spacing, fertility decisions. I, from an economic perspective, the most compelling reason for me seems to be that just the opportunity of the cost of their time increases. With the kinds of economic benefits that Clara and Shruti describe in mind, by the mid 1980s, Singapore was changing its policies. The reversal in policy to have more children came in 1986. I think. It was in 1986 that the policy officially changed. As a snarky headline in the New York Times put it, "Singapore decides it wants lots of children after all." But the policy change didn’t happen overnight. 1984, the thinking was already quite clear. They started this graduate-mother scheme, graduate-mother policy, where if you are a graduate mother, you get more incentives— School, education. For education for your children, tax incentives, including subsidy for even hiring a foreign maid. These were some of the incentives that were given for graduate mothers to go out and work, and also to have more children. At that time, anyway, there was a belief that smart women produce smart children. The shift wasn’t just from Stop-at-Two to, everyone have as many kids as you can. The new policy slogan was: have three or more, if you can afford it. And even then, the government preference was for highly-educated women to be the ones having children. The slogan and program were a little harder to distill in a soundbite than Stop-at-Two. It also had to convince a generation that grew up with Stop-at-Two messaging. Among my siblings, we’re the only two who have three kids. All the rest have two. Even my brother, who married twice with each wife, he had two children. So it’s just like, "Oh, that’s the best number. It makes sense." When thinking about the intuitive power of Stop-at-Two, Vimala recalls a family night out at a restaurant. When I had my second daughter, she kept telling us, "Oh, four of us, that’s just fine." I still remember we were at the restaurant, she said, "You see, there’s a table for four? That’s just nice for us." And so when I told her I was having my third one, she wasn’t happy at all because she felt that was really not the plan. So I think all of us had that in mind. We are very subtle... there’s subtle messages that they sent to us. Skeptical parents were only one of the barriers to Singapore’s new policy efforts. Another force was at work, a result of the country’s rapid economic growth over the years that the Stop-at-Two policy was in place. In the field of demography—the study of human populations—one of the major concepts is what’s called the “demographic transition.” This is the name for a phenomenon that has been observed in virtually every country around the world: it describes the shift within a country from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth rates and low death rates.There's an ongoing debate about what exactly causes this transition. Social and economic development—things like improved sanitation and better education, especially for women and girls—are correlated with declining fertility and increased longevity.The result: a more slowly growing population and an aging one, sometimes even one that shrinks. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, Singapore’s economic development was rapid, moving it further along the journey to, you guessed it, demographic transition. Since then, Singapore’s population has continued to grow, but the rate of growth has slowed and is projected to continue falling for the foreseeable future. So what does it mean to have an aging or declining population? Well, for starters the costs of supporting such a population can strain national budgets. And put more financial pressure on younger working-age people to support the elderly. Both individually and through expanding social programs. There’s also quite a lot of evidence that aging populations are less dynamic. And more hostile to new ideas.So as Singapore was going through its own demographic transition, it decided to work against the trend with policies that encouraged fertility.Some thinkers are encouraging economically developed countries to fight the demographic transition. To understand more about why Singapore and other countries are concerned about slowing population growth rates, I called up Matt Yglesias. I’m Matthew Yglesias. I write a newsletter called Slow Boring. I’m a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, and I wrote a book recently called . If you’re on Twitter, you probably didn’t need that introduction. The full title of his book is One Billion Americans: The Case For Thinking Bigger. And Yglesias certainly thinks big when it comes to the United States population. In some way, the population is the most important infrastructure of all. We’re talking about tripling the population density of the United States in this book. That would put us on a par with France. We’d be at about half the density of Germany. Most of the country is not unspoiled wilderness. It just has room for more people in it. He argues that a larger population in the United States would be beneficial to more than just technological development. I think it also matters for innovation and for culture that, part of the strength of the United States is that a lot of people come here to try to pursue their biggest dreams. And that can be technology entrepreneurs. It’s also movie directors. Like, if you do really well in New Zealand cinema, you get to go make a movie in America because we have a big audience, we have a big enterprise here. That New Zealand cinema example feels especially on point. Just a week ago, while we were finishing this episode, the biggest movie in the world was , directed by Taika Waititi, who got a start making indie movies in New Zealand and had his international breakout with a mockumentary about vampire flatmates in Wellington. Now he’s in Hollywood making Marvel movies and scheduled to write and direct a Star Wars film. In his writing, Yglesias brings up a particular statistic, that many women in the United States end up having fewer children than they say they want. What’s interesting, though, is that in the ’70s, there was a really big decline in how many children American women said they wanted to have. For the past 20 years, you have not seen that decline in intended fertility, but actual completed fertility has kept ticking downwards. Listening to Yglesias, I was reminded that Clara Piano, who we heard from earlier on this episode, made a similar point. Educated women in developed countries, in particular, have the highest fertility gaps, which essentially means that, although they say when they’re around age 25, "I’d like to have, maybe, three children," on average they end up having two. So that’s a pretty big gap and it’s, for me, a signal that there’s something going on that we don’t really understand. So what can governments do? Clara offers an answer that touches on some of the physical infrastructure discussed in previous episodes of this podcast. At the end of the day, I think that, really, just the best way to think about this is to increase freedom quite literally. Because women and men, in general, are saying, "I would like to have more children." There are some barriers that are preventing them from having children, and so just basic things like increasing economic freedom, labor mobility, freeing up people to fulfill their plans, whether or not that’s economic or for their families. For housing, to be able to move and to increase the supply of housing so we can have rooms for the children. These are more promising approaches. So what does this look like in practice? The promising approaches Clara mentions point towards options beyond government policies aimed at directly encouraging or discouraging citizens from having kids.Maybe the problem is that people are being prevented from having the number of children they say they want because of rising costs of living, housing, social support, or any number of other pressures.So while building more housing, further expanding the child tax credit, increasing labor mobility, ensuring paid maternity and paternity leave, and promoting workplace flexibility might not solve every problem—I think they're policies worth pursuing anyway.Back in Singapore, Titus and Vimala ended up having three children. And though their third was born after the Stop-at-Two policy ended, there were still challenges and a lack of support. When I had my third child in 1990, I had no maternity leave or whatever. I didn’t get a salary for two months if I decided to go on leave. Luckily, they have the kind of financial stability that allowed them to feel comfortable having a third child. Well, for us, actually, we were about to get married. Our idea was we would have children and, of course, at that time it had been ingrained in us two children. That was proper number to have. Even if we had three, we did not have an issue with that. We had our two children. First child was born in ’81, second one in ’85. And then, five years later, we were blessed with a third daughter. Titus and Vimala are both well educated and have stable jobs. The financial incentives and disincentives of the Stop-at-Two and have-three-or-more-if-you-can policies were a part of their lives, but they didn’t have to change their family planning decisions because of them. Today, they have three grown daughters with families of their own. My mother was maybe my role model. My mom was a housewife and she worked, she was a very hard-working housewife, so I used her as, "Okay, I want to be a bit like her also." Because I read a lot, I’m a literature teacher, teacher of English and literature, so for me, having three girls, I tried to impart quite a lot of things that I enjoyed in my life to them, like poetry and taking them to plays. Seeing them come full-circle, like having their own families, I think that in itself is a joy. Yeah. I suppose when they were young, of course, there’s the joy as they developed and progressed. Achievements in school, achievements in other areas of art or whatever. That brings joy to us. And as my wife said, when they found their life partners, you know… Reflecting on the various policy programs he’s seen over the last 50 years in Singapore, Titus remains optimistic about the country and the future. We have lived in a fairly strict country. The standard of living is reasonably good. Salaries are reasonably good. And I think we are quite happy to have been born and living in Singapore. And Singapore continues to promote policies that support families that have more children. In 2008, paid maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. And in 2013, one week of paid paternity leave was added. The government also offers tax breaks, housing subsidies, and even cash payments. Maybe this set of incentives will be enough on its own, or maybe, in 2022, the government will still be looking for all the help it can get and we’ll see a return of the Mentos ad.As we’ve been researching and preparing this episode, I’ve been saying that this one is for the mothers, because when it comes to decisions about having kids, the people who carry them for nine months are often the ones who pay the highest price, physically and economically.And I hope to be one of those people. So while it’s easy to get lost in the economic theory or the global-level demographic statistics, this is personal for me. And so many aspiring parents around the world. And very, very real. The kinds of policies we’ve been talking about in this episode could directly impact my life when I have kids of my own.Vimala didn’t receive paid time off to have her third child. The United States, where I will likely have my children one day, is one of the only industrialized nations that does not have a national standard for paid family leave.But what years of research into the causes of declining fertility rates have demonstrated is that economic policies, even very generous ones, aren’t necessarily enough to move the needle on birth rates. Extended families, communities and other layers of social support also really matter. They certainly did for my family. And at least in my circles, this fact is increasingly acknowledged. Some of my friends are even making concrete plans to raise their children together. So I’m hopeful. Hopeful that there can be policies and social structures in place that ensure everyone has the freedom to make their own independent choices about how, when and with whom to have children. is a production of Stripe Press.

That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is . Hello and welcome to  B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts.If you listened to the most recent episode of the podcast, you heard a brief snippet of my interview with Shruti Rajagopalan. She is a Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center and leads the Indian political economy research program and Emergent Ventures India at Mercatus.In our conversation we discuss not only the economic implications of India’s population growth, but also she gives personal insights into India’s history, sharing some of her experiences growing up in socialist India and witnessing its economic transformation firsthand.So here is my conversation with Shruti Rajagopalan which has been lightly edited.I’m going to have you first introduce yourself and your relevant affiliations. That is relatively easy. I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emerging Ventures Grants program, also at Mercatus. I’m a Fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU law school, because in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. I host a podcast called the Ideas of India, which is an attempt to bridge the gap between academic ideas and political economy, real world problems in India. And my main area of research is writing about Indian political economy, more specifically, my training is in public choice economics, law and economics, constitutional economics. I’m a very classic George Mason University trained economist. So, that’s all my affiliations, I think. Wow, is what I’ll say. Wow. Shruti, I want to start off with some context about India. So, how big is India, both in size and population? And I’m curious, for somebody who doesn’t have an immediate picture of how large India is, how does it compare to the rest of the world? So I think it’s something like 17% of the world’s population?  Exactly. So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of hard number to even imagine, right. The United States for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people, right. So, the Indian population is 18% of the world. Having said that, India is a very young country, right. So the median age is about three to four years lower than most developing countries and much lower than the developed Western world, which has an aging population. It’s the second largest country, in terms of population and barring natural disaster or existential risk, nuclear war, asteroid hit, it’s likely to be the most populous country in the world.It’s the sixth largest economy just because the size is so large. I think nominal GDP is about 2.7 trillion US dollars, something like that. Having said that, in terms of GDP per capita, it’s still relatively a low to middle income country. It’s about $2,000 GDP per capita. Just as a point of comparison, China is about 5X the GDP per capita of India. South Korea is about 15X, right. And the United States is about 30X. So, in terms of being rich, it’s great to have a very large country, but it’s even more important that it’s a very large number of people who are also very, very prosperous. I actually want to add one more question for context. So, I was born in Nigeria, we’ve talked about this a little bit and I saw a tweet forever ago, basically pointing out the futility of talking about a country like Nigeria as though it were one country, something like 200 different ethnic groups within the country. And I wonder to what extent is this also true of India? Absolutely. I mean, I think Nigeria and India are great examples of this kind of diversity, but also how difficult it is to paint the country in one color. So just as an example, Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest state in India, it’s the size of Brazil. The smallest state in India, Sikkim, is closer to the size of Bhutan, which is like a really small Himalayan Kingdom country, right. India’s richest states like Goa, which is a great place. All the tourists love to go to Goa. It has a GDP per capita closer to Jordan, right. And India’s poorer state, Bihar is closer to Haiti. So, that’s basically the difference, right. And there are some Southern states like Kerala, which have...great on human indicators, 100% literacy rates. Again, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are relatively poor, they’re barely at the halfway mark.And in terms of linguistic diversity, there are 18 or 19 official languages, but they’re technically thousands of dialects. Very similar to Nigeria in this sense. The caste system is another point of fragmentation. There’s a lot of religious fragmentation, of course. Hindus are the majority in terms of population, about 83%, but it’s about 13, 14% Muslims, right. It’s one of the largest Islamic countries in terms of absolute numbers. I think it’s the second largest. So, in terms of religious diversity, caste diversity, ethnic diversity, it’s really, really big. You’d love this, the Cambridge economist, Joan Robinson, she once said that, "The frustrating thing about India is whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true." And I think this is really true also of Nigeria, in the sense, right. Anything you can say about one tribe, you can get the exact opposite example in another end of the country in a different state, in a different city.So I think that point is very well taken. So India, when we say...it’s just, I’m talking about a geographical boundary and a state entity and a certain kind of common culture, a democratic framework, those are things that hold Indians together, but you’re right. We got to get specific really quickly with countries like India. Well, now that we’ve said that, we’re going to zoom back out then. For anybody who hasn’t read How India Can Use Its Numbers, your excellent article, could you maybe summarize the argument and tell folks the context in which it appeared? I grew up in socialist India and at that time, the economic rates of growth were relatively low, but population was growing really quickly, because post World War II, with all the advances in medicine and infectious diseases or battling infectious diseases, suddenly you saw infant mortality drop, you saw people living much longer lives. There’s this huge boom in population. But if the size of the economic pie is not growing, it means you’re basically redistributing the same size of the pie with more and more people.So in this context, it becomes very easy to have a Malthusian point of view, which is people are the problem, right. Wherever you look, you think in terms of zero sum games, because that’s how socialist economies operate. There isn’t a positive sumness that comes from create and openness, but also, all the infrastructure is crumbling, right.There are too many people. Every time you need to get on a bus, you see that you got to elbow 15 people to even get on a bus, right. Or school admissions, right. Every single basic public service that you use, whether it’s roads congestion, whether it’s water runs out the moment you go to the public well or the public tap. So these kinds of problems led people to blame population and the government intervened in so many different ways. At one point, even policy called for sterilizations during the undemocratic time of the emergency.But usually, more benign ways of essentially reducing the population, right. And this has led to, I think, a basic misconception. We need to bring the focus back now that India has liberalized and now it’s actually a trading economy, it’s plugged into the global economy, that more people are actually a good thing, right. So as Julian Simon said that, "People are the ultimate resource." right. And why do we think people are the ultimate resource? I think that’s the insight which is a little bit harder for people who come from the Malthusian point of view. And this comes to why or where we think economic growth comes from, right. And it’s not coming from just more physical resources. Economic growth comes from new ideas. We take for granted the idea that having a large population is beneficial. You and I are doing this interview in the United States. You’re from India, I’m from Nigeria. So I’ll ask you directly, why is having a large population beneficial? This is a great question and it’s unintuitive to most people, right. Because most people just think, "Oh, there are more mouths to feed," right. Especially in socialist economies or developing countries, but economists and more and more economists who worked on growth theories, whether it’s Paul Romer or Michael Kremer, right. Their idea is that the central or the key to economic growth is new ideas, right. New ideas are more important than just some form of capital, physical capital or labor or something else, right.Once you recognize the power of ideas, the value of the population comes into focus, right. People, especially well educated people, healthy populations, smart, creative people in a space where they’re constantly bumping into each other, are the source of not just new ideas, but also how to combine these new ideas into more and more and more applications and that is really where economic growth comes from. And this is not just true of today’s tech economy or Silicon Valley or something very specific, right. Michael Kremer has this great paper, it’s called Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990. This is a generalized trend for all of human history. And you can even see this, you go to small island countries for tourism or something like that, you’ve seen that these populations can tend to stagnate. They need outside people to come in and trade with them all the time, otherwise they do stagnate, right.Whereas large connected populations, you live in New York City, right. That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, right. Where ideas multiply. Matt Ridley has a great phrase, he says, "Where ideas can have sex," right. That’s what we really need, right. So now fortunately, India already has the resources of a large number of people, right. Now, we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other, their ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce globally is going to be Indian. Shruti, in your article, you identified, I think it was three policy areas in which a large population could, if utilized well or if allowed to flourish, could really unlock other gains. What were those policy areas? Yeah, so I’ll tell you a little bit about India before jumping into the policy prescription, because I think it’s important to also specify the problem. So, as I said, the people exist in India, right. And India thankfully, is a democratic country with free movement, so that is a wonderful thing, unlike China, right. That’s the closest example of a country which has large numbers of people, but they’re not allowed free movement, free assembly and so on. But in India, there are a few really major problems. The first is that India’s internal market is completely fragmented. One of the reasons the United States has been such a huge economic success is the United States was one of the first and largest free trade zones. You can trade anywhere within the United States. That never quite happened for India because states had a lot of different taxation regimes.They used to have internal tariff regimes. If you’re shipping apples or banana chips from one state to another state, you have to not only pay tariffs and taxes, but the differential tariffs and taxes come with a lot of corruption, long lines at highways where bureaucrats and corrupt inspectors can extract lots of bribes from you. That was the economy, and that naturally fragments the economy into smaller and smaller parts. And the greatest losers in this are obviously the poorer states, right. Because they’re kind of getting cut out of the market. So the number one thing is how to make sure that India’s internal market stays unified. So for this, the Indian government already took one step, which is unifying the tax regime, right, from this splintered, many-state system to a unified value added tax, it’s called the goods and services tax, but they did it the Indian way.It has eight different tax rates. It’s very complex, it’s a complete mess. So, if they streamline that, that’s going to be a huge improvement. India also needs far better infrastructure and this is where the good news is. We know that if India unifies a single market, there’s going to be so much more trade and therefore, so much more revenue for the government that actually, the additional infrastructure is just going to pay for itself, right. It’s not a net loss to build more roads, right. Or to build more ports or railways and transportation systems, coal storage, warehousing. These are things that will pay for themselves, so that’s one major part of it. The second is India’s labor market is a complete disaster, right. And this is, again, goes back to the socialist history of...there are just about, I think 40 or 50 federal level labor laws and regulation, and every state has its own rules and own regulation, which means at any given point, if you’re a countrywide firm, you have to follow 200, 300 different codes of regulation.And there’s a labor inspection system, which is of course, very corrupt and can completely extract rents, but what that does is it makes it very costly to hire people in a labor surplus economy, which is a terrible, terrible thing. And therefore, and you’ll be familiar with this from the Nigerian experience, it gets pushed into the informal market. And what I mean by the informal market is that it’s basically just escaping taxes and regulation, right. There’s nothing poor quality of the informal market. My engagement ring, I’m showing it to Tammy right now, comes from the informal market, right. So you can have very high quality, very, very expensive jewelry, leather goods, artwork, all this manufacturing happening in the shadow of India’s regulation. And what that does is it doesn’t allow it to scale, right. When things can’t formalize, they can’t get access to credit.And more importantly, in the labor market, people can’t get gainfully employed in sensible jobs that are salaried. They’re basically working daily wage labor, right. So this really needs to get fixed. 80% of India works in the informal economy. So they need to be brought back in a way out of the shadows, into the light. And the only way to do that is to deregulate in a meaningful way, countrywide, so that it becomes very easy to hire labor and it becomes very easy for actually people to invest and develop their skills. And the third thing is India, for its state of development, got connected to the internet, right, very, very quickly. This has again, got something to do with its numbers, right. When you need to lay the pipes, right. Or to put down the infrastructure for internet or telecom connectivity, a very large size market helps, right.Because very large number of subscribers means that you can put in the capital expenditure required to lay the pipes. So in India, that happened really quickly. I believe 816 million people are connected to a mobile phone in India. So it has fantastic mobile phone penetration. I think three out of four households has at least one phone. So the household has access. And that means that...and data is so cheap in India that I believe at one point someone was telling me, I met someone who used to work at HBO and they told me that Game of Thrones is super popular in India, though, it never launched by then. Everyone was watching it on torrent or something because data and streaming is so cheap in India that HBO decided that, "Okay, this is a very large market. We need to simultaneously start releasing this in India because there’s this huge fan base."So I think because India got connected, a lot of the network goods as we call them, this is platforms, right. Especially...I mean, you work at Stripe, so you completely understand what I’m talking about, but even more basic, like Twitter, Facebook, any kind of platform good, Uber, all this has a massive market potentially in India, right. People should get used to how you and I speak because more and more stuff on Netflix is going to sound like you and me, right. Because that’s where the eyeballs are going to come from in the future. So I think this is an underappreciated insight and for some things, you just need more eyeballs, right. For things like subscription services, for things like Twitter. For some things, you also need purchasing power. So as India gets richer, then more people are also going to use Stripe Press, right. Not just Stripe, right. As India gets more educated. So I think this is an insight that’s really valuable. So these are three areas where massive amount of investment is going to help India in a meaningful way. I’m curious about the 1991 reforms in India and what effect they had on the Indian economy. Oh, this is great question and my current passion project. So, I should plug this because we run a project called the 1991 Project at the Mercatus Center right now. It started last year in July on the 30th anniversary of the reforms and the website is the1991project.com. So basically, India was a socialist economy and was increasingly growing more and more socialist, since let’s say about World War II until 1990. That meant that India was basically hugely impoverished, right. And there were years or decades when the rate of economic growth didn’t even keep up with population growth, right. So there were years of negative GDP per capita growth. And this was obviously not sustainable, but in the late ’80s and early ’90s, what actually brought the country to crisis was a balance of payments problem, right. India simply did not have enough currency to afford its huge imports, especially its oil imports and energy imports, and it didn’t export enough, right. It didn’t have enough foreign exchange. So it was this crazy economy where a lot of short term debt and ballooning interest payments, which could basically topple the currency and therefore, in a meaningful way, bring down macroeconomic stability. So something had to be done. And those years, the IMF and World Bank used to have something called the Washington Consensus and they would have this long list of prescriptions for countries who were going through this macroeconomic crisis. We’ve known about this in the East Asian countries or Latin American countries. India had had similar talks and exchanges before with the World Bank and IMF when this didn’t succeed, but in 1991, something very curious and interesting had happened. A lot of the people who were in the Indian government at that time had gone and seen the growth miracle in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Singapore, right.They had been to Western countries. They had worked at the World Bank and IMF as technocrats. They had studied in American universities and they brought back this idea that, "Hang on, markets and trade are not such a terrible thing." So there was a major shift away from these hard entrant socialist values towards, "We need to open up trade." So what India did in 1991, I’ll give you the Cliff Notes version and those who are deeply interested can go to the website, is it reduced import tariffs, it devalued its currency, right, in a meaningful way, and when I say reduced import tariffs, I mean, some of the average rate of tariffs was I think 155% and the highest tariff rate was over 350%, right. So it started bringing those down in a sensible way, so now people could actually import, and this is again, not so intuitive.If you can import better, you can export cheaper, because your imports just became more efficient and higher quality and so on. So India’s total, entire chunk of trade as a part of GDP started increasing. India started getting richer. But on the other hand, another major reform that happened was India had crazy industrial licensing. The kinds that you read in economic textbooks that are talking about the socialist calculation problem. The Indian Planning Commission would tell its industrialists or entrepreneurs, how many bicycles they can produce, how many Vespas they can produce, right. How much paper can be produced or printed in a given year? So this import controlled economy where they were told what they can produce basically became a shortages scarcity economy, right. Long lines for everything.Overnight, industrial licensing was completely eliminated in India by end of July 1991, except a few select industries where they controlled some things. This basically...I mean, now you say that, "Oh, you can produce as many bicycles as people are willing to buy?" And you can imagine the gains that just unleashes, right. So these were some of the reforms that happened that brought India out of a very strictly controlled economy, internally and externally, and integrated it to the global market. And I’m a huge beneficiary of it. At the time, I was seven, eight years old when the reforms happen and overnight, I went from choice between two chocolate brands, which weren’t even that good, now there were dozens of different kinds of chocolates I could eat, right.And Michael Jackson, who my sister adored and I adored, used to drink Pepsi, and now, we could get a Michael Jackson CD, right. We could buy a CD player and we could get Pepsi, which is what he used to drink. So my memory of liberalization is also very visceral, right. Even as a kid, I knew that something major’s happening and my life is so much better. Of course, I come from a very privileged, upper middle class background, but for poorer people, it meant shortages and lines went away. When they’re standing in line for their rations, now they’re no longer getting terrible quality. Now, they’re actually getting good quality rations or they’re getting better t-shirts to wear because they were imported from China or Taiwan, right. I mean their clothing bill just got cheaper, when people are very poor, that matters. So at every level, right. It brought this huge change in India and we’re working on a year long project. We are recording oral histories with technocrats. We’re trying to understand why these ideas changed. We’re trying to show the growth that it unleashed.India went from an economy that was growing at 3% or 4% to an economy that eventually started growing at 7, 8%. And for 25 years, India grew...sustained at about 6 to 7% on average per annum, and it has lifted 270 million people out of poverty, right. That’s the size of...it’s like creating a new prosperous country almost, right. That’s an extraordinary achievement. So, I think the 1991 reforms, after Indian independence from colonial powers, if there is one major thing that’s happened in India to make everyone’s life better, globally and for Indians, it would probably be that moment. I mean, that’s incredible and I encourage anybody listening to go to the 1991 Project and also, to keep following your work. Could you speak a little bit more to how the Indian government reacted to perceived overpopulation? Absolutely. So, it started in a benign way, right. It initially started with education programs. We need to tell people to have fewer kids and that sort of thing. And a lot of those educational programs were linked to women’s health, right. This is a huge stress on women, right. This kind of reproductive stress. Then, there were campaigns that encouraged more people to adopt birth control or use condoms and things like that, right. So at that stage, and this is all pre-AIDS, right. So this is not use condoms for safer sex, this is use condoms to birth fewer children, right. So this was what was going on in the heyday of socialism under Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who was then prime minister, at one point, India suddenly moved from a democratic to an authoritarian regime for about 22 months.This was the famous episode of the Indian emergency. So India called a national level emergency and civil liberties were completely disrupted or no longer guaranteed and the government became very oppressive, right. The entire opposition of India was jailed. One of the major policy programs at that time, which her son initiated in her name, was for sterilization. And they would just capture young men, young military age men, peak reproductive age rather, and they would take them away to these clinics and make them forcibly have this procedure. So it was just crazy for a little while, right. And it was obviously a hugely unpopular move. It went away immediately after the emergency. India has never done anything that terrible since the late 70s, but it did happen. Now, I want to talk for a minute about some of the unintended consequences.So in a poor country, which has a relatively high birth rate or fertility rate, and this is mixed with very high son preference, right. Culturally, countries like India and many countries in Africa too, including Nigeria, son preference. I mean, this is not uniform, but there are parts of Nigeria, there are parts of India where son preference is incredibly high. So not only should India have more people, it should have a lot more women. So this is one of the unintended consequences. I think this as a policy regime, has now been...it’s gone completely out of vogue. It comes up, some politicians will bring it up.In Uttar Pradesh recently, they said, "Oh, we need to limit to two children." Something like that, but this is no longer a major war cry of the socialist era. And I think there has been a lot of learning from China’s forced one child policy and how now it has this aging demographic that can’t quite carry...the next generation can’t quite carry the weight of this skewed demographic that’s going to age. So I think that is a learning globally, that you need to walk away from these very strict population control policies and I think India’s learned something from it. I just have two more questions because I know I’ve taken a lot of your time. To what extent does immigration matter for India, whether that’s in-migration or emigration? I think hugely. Indian diaspora does incredibly well abroad, right. And I mean, America’s a great example of this. There’s a fantastic book by Devesh Kapur and Sanjoy Chakravorty, it’s called , right. And it’s basically talk about how the Indian diaspora in the United States is one of the most high performing groups anywhere, even within the States or anywhere in the world, right. So in terms of outmigration, Indians have done very, very well abroad and they have assimilated very well in a lot of different cultures. I think that really matters, right. That there is a group of people who are entrepreneurial, who are well educated and are syncretic and who can assimilate.In terms of in-migration, India’s neighboring countries, depending on which neighbor, may or may not have porous borders, right. So with Bangladesh, it’s a very porous border. In fact, there are millions of daily wage workers who cross the border, work in India and go back. Now, this is going to be lesser and lesser of a phenomenon, because I believe Bangladesh’s GDP per capita just overtook India’s, right. So as Bangladesh gets richer, we are not going to have an in-migration issue with daily wage labor, it might even be out. It might be Indians crossing the border to go to Bangladesh to look for work. In terms, but a lot of the borders are very, very strict, because it borders with China and there are conflict areas or it borders with Pakistan, which has been a very long running conflict area. So because of that, you don’t have this foot movement across borders, but India for all practical purposes has a pretty open immigration regime.It’s just a question of who would wish to come and work in India and naturally assimilate in that environment. So, it has to be someone who is...it’s very easy for someone who is English speaking, relatively elite, gets very easily plugged into the formal part of the economy. It’s quite easy to move to India and immediately find work and things like that. And India has so many examples of people coming in as BBC reporters and just staying back, right. Because they’ve assimilated almost too well.On the other hand, if you are looking to come from some of the poorer parts of Asia or Africa, it can be difficult to integrate into a country if you don’t know the lingua franca, and India is so specific in terms of its caste and religious and linguistic relationships that it’s not easy for outside groups to just immediately mingle on say, a factory floor or just come and buy agricultural land and become a farmer or something like that. So, the very typical migration that you see from an even poorer country in India to come to India and start picking cotton or something like that, you don’t see much of that happening in India. And as a percentage of population, it’s a blip. India has just got so many people that migration is not the route that changes numbers, meaningfully. One, I appreciate so much that you took the time and we’re both optimists, I think, and I wonder, to close this conversation out, what are, to your mind, the most potent reasons for optimism about India’s future? Lots and lots of people, right. And lots and lots of people who are getting better and better and get integrated into the global economy. And this is because of India’s own regime of relatively free speech, democratic systems and access to the internet. So, I should give you this example. Recently, I like collecting a lot of Indian art, especially tribal art. I bought a particular piece of art, it’s made on textile. It’s called Mata ni Pachedi. I can send you the picture and it’s by a wonderful artist called Sanjay Chitara. I hope I’m saying his name right, and he’s from Gujarat and it was...I mean, he’s basically vegetable dye on textile and it was sold on an online auction platform. I bought it sitting in a Washington, DC suburb and the payments were processed by Stripe, right.And so, this kind of integration has now made an artist who works on folk art in India so much richer because we have been able to connect with him and there’s massive gains from trade. Those are the sorts of things that make me incredibly optimistic about India. I think what is preventing India from reaching its full potential is basically, very poor regulation, bad government regulation. Government just needs to get out of the way and let Indians be entrepreneurial. And the second is just very poor health and education systems, which always...I think that really hampers people from reaching their full potential, right.How many wonderful artists and Einsteins and Mozarts and geniuses are hiding in India because they are not plugged into the global network, either because they couldn’t access education or they’re not healthy enough, or they’re not rich enough to afford a phone and an internet connection and so on, right. So I think those are the things, if India can manage to fix, I’m just very, very optimistic about its future, but most importantly, because of its numbers. is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager.  Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. We had additional editing support from Emma Jackson. Original music for the series was composed by Auribus.Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is . B-Sides. Hello, and welcome to the final episode of season one of . I’m your host, Tamara Winter. Over the course of six episodes, we’ve traveled the world from London to Lusaka, from the Salton Sea to Singapore and talked to infrastructure experts and visionaries who are all working to find creative solutions to some of the biggest problems facing their communities and the world.So it’s not surprising that, well, we have a lot more information than can fit into the episodes we made. So today I’m sitting down with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s the series producer for . You might remember him from episode two, when we visited his family’s plot of land near California’s Salton Sea. Together, we revisited each episode discussing some of the clips, characters, and stories that got left on the cutting room floor. We also got to talking about some of the big themes and episode ideas that we’ve been sitting on, ones that might make for an interesting season two, possibly a video spinoff? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I hope you enjoy this look beneath the surface of . Well, today we’re back in the studio talking about some of our highlights and lowlights and all the interesting things in between, our experiences in producing . Tammy just tracked the final episode, and now we’re just kind of reflecting on some of our learnings from it. I also wonder how many times we can say "beneath the surface" in this conversation, take a shot of oat milk every time. So, Tammy, obviously we’ve kind of learned a lot through digging into these various topics, but maybe we can start at the top. The first episode was very kind of close to you, near and dear. And you have a lot of firsthand experience. What has happened in Zambia or what have we kind of just learned in Lusaka and in Nkwashi since we launched that first episode? I think what was particularly exciting about that episode, and I think for a lot of this series is that the stuff that we talked about is happening in real time. And that is very much the case with Nkwashi. So actually this week, as we speak and sit here in San Francisco, Mwiya and several other entrepreneurs are hosting the African Union and they are talking about just interesting ideas around trade and development and economic growth. And so I’m sad we couldn’t be there. But Nkwashi itself too, it’s amazing to see people move in. The residents of Nkwashi starting to kind of identify with the city and post about it.I think one of the things that was particularly interesting about that episode is that there’s a growth story within a growth story within a growth story. So we’re talking about a city in Zambia and then beyond that, we’re also talking about what it hopes to enable, which is like a really robust and flourishing technological ecosystem. So since that episode Nkwashi’s grown. There are, it seems like new interesting companies popping up, not just in Zambia, but across the continent, like every five minutes. So I’m optimistic. It was really great kind of going from a place like Zambia and Nkwashi and then kind of bringing that somewhat closer to home. Obviously Salton Sea, was really kind of personal for me, but the most kind of exciting moment that I had there was actually spending time in Slab City and East Jesus and getting to meet a lot of the people that live off the grid there. And actually kind of realizing ultimately infrastructure is about supporting people. It’s the thing that kind of supports a lot of these different communities and lifestyles. More broadly, one thing I enjoyed about the Salton Sea episode, I think we could probably do a whole series on places that were, and then are now starting to come back. I mean, I don’t know that Salton Sea was ever on top necessarily, but it’s pretty striking that it went from being sort of the next Palm Springs to like an asthma machine. And so yeah, that could probably be its own series. Yeah, it was interesting when, when we were there, I actually do recall quite a few like luxury cars, like Audis and BMWs driving around and exploring the area. And I can’t tell if they were just kind of extending their Palm Desert vacay or if they were genuinely looking at it from a developer’s perspective, because land can be had for pennies on the dollar there. But maybe there is kind of this thought that lithium is kind of permeating through the community and the people are starting to look at it as more of an investment. So it was really fascinating to see some of that going on. Yeah. And it just seemed like the conversation around Salton Sea is very much live. So I’m optimistic. I’m interested to see how GM kind of makes good on its commitment to have all electric vehicles by 2035. I’m interested to see what Tesla does there, what Ford does there. It’s going to be a place to watch, particularly if the Controlled Thermal Resources team can manage to make a breakthrough with the way that lithium is extracted. You’ll hear me say this a lot in this episode, I’m just very optimistic. Supply chains. We talked a lot about, I think supply chains was probably the first episode that we really knew that we wanted to try and tackle this thing, not only because of how it’s been exacerbated by COVID, but also because I think the shipping container as a unit of measurement and as a metaphor and as an example for efficiency, actually gets kind of thrown around quite a bit in the industries and circles that we talk about. But just seeing you and Ryan Petersen interact was really fascinating. And seeing him kind of naturally dig into some of the storylines and the narratives that we talk about things like trade routes, historic trade routes, the Silk Road and how that was not only responsible for trading of goods, but also this kind of cultural transmission and how that shaped a lot of the people. You could almost see it as a cultural gradient throughout broader Asia and the Eastern Europe continent. So, that was really great. I think what was particularly interesting about this episode is that Ryan, it’s funny, he’s running one of the biggest companies in the world that’s focused on global trade. Despite the size of the company that Ryan is running, he had such a ground floor view of the acute challenges that the US, and kind of more specifically California, and even more specifically the port of Long Beach were facing. The thought to just like literally go out to the port and talk to some of the union workers and bring tacos. And literally just get people talking about what exactly was keeping people’s stuff so backed up was interesting. And it turns out that even though that was such a triumphant moment, when Ryan was able to help the city and really the state get that port up and running, there are still kind of persistent supply chain challenges. Yeah. I remember, I think we had to rewrite some of the intros and some of the narrative bits to hear mainly because it was changing so rapidly. And I think when we first conceived the episode, things weren’t as congested in the ports. And then ultimately by the time we recorded, I remember going out to Malibu and seeing this long stretch of backed up cargo ships. And that was something I’d never seen. I’ve seen it in port towns, like maybe Singapore or Asia, but never on the California coast. So that was kind of mind blowing to actually visualize it.Housing, because a lot of it was Ben Southwood. I actually thought it was great seeing Ben Southwood in his natural element. When we were out there recently, I got to walk around with Ben and he’s just like a natural encyclopedic kind of tour guide, just hearing him point out very obscure, but also fascinating things about, "Look at this building. This brick pattern is because of this. And this is how it affects the building structurally." And going into ancient Rome and Londinium, and this was all within like a three block radius. So I really enjoyed kind of hearing him talk with the Haredi Jews, because they were able to kind of speak the same language, but also from very different perspectives, which was really fascinating. We knew we wanted to do something on housing, but the conversation around housing, why we don’t have enough of it, why it’s so expensive for me has gotten just extremely stale. And so it was really nice to see a very interesting community and maybe not necessarily the first one that you would think of being on the front lines of upzoning and really doing something about the astronomical rises in the cost of housing. So I really enjoyed personally, just learning about how Motty and Shmuel and the rest of the community were able to kind of solve their own problem. Yeah, I guess that is one of the kind of things that changed even in the short time, since we launched this episode. I think we’re originally looking at it from a buyer’s perspective, looking at the markets, but then when you start looking abroad and realizing that even things like zoning, these are the things that are really impacting housing costs. And ultimately, what ties to the whole series together, I think it goes back to what a lot of things that Ryan Petersen was talking about, building materials and supply chains are also exacerbating housing inventory and things like that. One thing that I also started to see as a series unfolded was how all of these seemingly disparate topics were kind of connected through supply chain and infrastructure, ultimately. One thing I particularly appreciated about that episode was that I think sometimes with infrastructure, it can be such a big topic. It’s something that everybody needs, but it also has a ton of different stakeholders and the costs of infrastructure don’t necessarily always present themselves immediately. Yeah, and it was really great to see. I mean, a topic like housing, there’s so many different vectors that can influence the ways that things like laws and zoning and ultimately building go. And this was a good example of them working with the municipalities local kind of government to retain the kind of historical sense of the area, but also kind of to address their cultural needs. Oh, transit was a great one. It was actually great to see kind of Tammy exploring her new surroundings out in New York City.In the episode she started off being a Dallas born and bred person, but moving to both places like San Francisco and New York that actually heavily rely on public transit. It was also really fascinating again, since we recorded and shipped this episode, there’s actually been some progress with bullet trains out in the Dallas and in the broader Texas area. So I’m wondering how that impacts you and your relationship with your kind of home base. Yeah. My sister texted me about that news. She loved the transit episode. So I’m from Dallas. My sister is in school in San Antonio right now. And so she was extremely excited about the bullet train. And I think people in Texas, I mean, that project has just made a ton of sense for a long time. So Texas I’m rooting for you. We started the housing episode talking about the fact that I had lived in San Francisco, DC and New York and kind of my experiences with renting in each of those cities. But the transit one is almost as striking, right? So each of those cities is very walkable, but the experience of taking transit and getting from point A to point B there is just very different.But I knew that I wanted to do an episode kind of as a thank you or a love letter or a like, thanks for welcoming me to New York. So it was really exciting to kind of explore the Upper East Side, to see the actual Second Avenue subway line in action. But it was just incredible listening to people talk about Japan and London and just other cities. I think what’s particularly striking about transit, even though it’s extremely difficult. It’s multifaceted. They’re all different agencies. There are like labor issues. There’s like what the public wants and will allow in their backyards. All of these things end up being impediments to transit. And yet some countries and cities still manage to get it done. You know what, one thing that I observed, even in the kind of very few times that I’ve ridden Japanese trains, it is like quite a user-centric experience. I think it integrates very well into the landscape. It kind of connects this kind of futurist vision that people have of Tokyo and this kind of ancient historic version of Kyoto and the broader area. And it’s not a destructive process. Oftentimes we think of building trains, especially in the United States, it means that we have to tear down or retrofit something that’s historic, and it does change the landscape and make it look and feel different. But in Tokyo, these layers are able to exist in a way that I think is actually, I don’t know, it preserves their cultural history, but it also kind of projects Japan as this very futuristic and forward thinking place. Population. I mean, this is the episode that I was most excited about. This is the one I knew I wanted to make no matter if we made any other episode, because I don’t have any special love for buildings and trains and roads. It’s all useful insofar as it serves people. And so I think questions and population are just fascinating. I mean, years ago I got really interested in birthright trends in the first place and what governments were doing about it. And so you could probably sit for hours and just go down a non-stop list of downright comical things that governments are trying to do to address what they perceive to be the sort of big challenges of having an aging population.And so it’s everything from, we talk about Singapore in the episode. What we don’t talk about is like the time that some of their train stations had literal cartoon eggs on the floor, reminding women that they only had like a finite number of eggs, to Italy’s fertility day to the classic Australian campaign, 40 is the new 20, except if you want to have children. And so I was interested in moving beyond the kind of friendly cringe shaming of women and their sort of expanded choices about rearing families and to really kind of observe how people make decisions about fertility. Yeah. It’s really interesting to see how Singapore kind of uses that lever or kind of turns that dial almost the way that we do here in the States with interest rates and things to kind of really stimulate or catalyze the economy because they’re kind of trying to envision 10, 20 years down the road, what the populace is going to do and how they’re going to impact all these things there. But ultimately, it does come down to like people and human capital as the main driver of economy because that’s why we do and make and build the things that we do is ultimately to kind of support and service people and human’s needs This episode, I was both very excited about, and that made me kind of uncomfortable because it turns human beings into kind of these fungible widgets that you can just kind of like turn on if you need more and turn off if you need fewer. It’s the one episode again, that I was kind of the most excited about going into it. And it’s also the one that I have the most questions, regrets. I don’t know what you would call that about. There are lots of things within population that are interesting. Decades ago, South Korea had a gender ratio that was like India’s. A lot more men than women due to a lot of like sex selective abortions and kind of social pressures to have more sons. And today their gender ratio is more like Canada’s. How does that happen? That’s a whole story in and of itself.And that right there may be the story of the series. That within every episode there was a thread that we barely got to pull. That could be an entire story in and of itself. It has been such a joy to work on this series, to sit down with climate scientists, population researchers, train nerds, housing analysts, and city builders, and to reflect on how all our lives are shaped by the infrastructure we build.If there were any questions that came up for you while you were listening to the series or just to this episode, let us know. The world of infrastructure is vast. And even though we’ve gone beneath the surface of six facets of it, I feel like in a lot of ways, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. So get in touch with us. You can send an email to stripepress@stripe.com or you can tweet us at @StripePress or @_TamaraWinter.Well, you’ve heard me say it at the end of every episode, but  is a production of Stripe Press. And since this is the last episode of season one, let me tell you a little bit more about Stripe Press. Our mission is to spread ideas for progress. So we publish books, produce movies, and yes, make podcasts all about people working for progress. One book that we recently released is  by Vannevar Bush, which was originally published in 1970. For anyone who doesn’t know, he’s the guy who basically founded the National Science Foundation. This book is his account of working as the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II. He was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuse, the mass production of penicillin and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. You can find out more about Stripe Press, the books we publish, the movies we produce, and yes, even the other episodes of this podcast at press.stripe.com.The senior producers for season one up  are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Original music for  was composed by Auribus. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee.

The most noticeable parts of this corner of the dam, now known as Monument Plaza, are the massive winged bronze sculptures and central flagpole which are often photographed by visitors. The most amazing feature of this plaza, however, is under their feet as they take those pictures.The plaza’s terrazzo floor is actually a celestial map that marks the time of the dam’s creation based on the 25,772-year axial precession of the earth.I was particularly interested in this monument because this axial precession is also the slowest cycle that we track in Long Now’s 10,000 Year Clock. Strangely, little to no documentation of this installation seemed to be available, except for a few vacation pictures on Flickr. So the last time I was in Las Vegas, I made a special trip out to Hoover Dam to see if I could learn more about this obscure 26,000-year monument.I parked my rental car on the Nevada side of the dam on a day pushing 100 degrees. I quickly found Monument Plaza just opposite the visitor center where tours of the dam are offered. While the plaza is easy to find, it stands apart from all the main tours and stories about the dam. With the exception of the writing in the plaza floor itself, the only information I could find came from a speaker running on loop, broadcasting a basic description of the monument while visitors walked around the area. When I asked my tour guide about it, he suggested that there may be some historical documentation and directed me to Emme Woodward, the dam’s historian.I was able to get in touch with her after returning home. As she sent me a few items, I began to see why the Bureau of Reclamation doesn’t explain very much about the monument’s background. The first thing she sent me was a description of the plaza by Oskar J. W. Hansen, the artist himself, which I thought would tell me everything I wanted to know. While parts of it were helpful, the artist’s statement of intention was also highly convoluted and opaque. An excerpt:These [human] postures may be matched to their corresponding reflexes in terms of angle and degree much as one would join cams in a worm-gear drive. There is an angle for doubt, for sorrow, for hate, for joy, for contemplation, and for devotion. There are as many others as there are fleeting emotions within the brain of each individual who inhabits the Earth. Who knows not all these postures of the mind if he would but stop to think of them as usable factors for determining proclivities of character? It is a knowledge bred down to us through the past experience of the whole race of men.It is pretty hard to imagine the US Bureau of Reclamation using this type of write-up to interpret the monument… and they don’t. And so there it stands, a 26,000-year clock of sorts, for all the world to see, and yet still mired in obscurity.While I may never totally understand the inner motivations of the monument’s designer, I did want to understand it on a technical level. How did Hansen create a celestial clock face frozen in time that we can interpret and understand as the date of the dam’s completion? The earth’s axial precession is a rather obscure piece of astronomy, and our understanding of it through history has been spotty at best. That this major engineering feat was celebrated through this monument to the axial precession still held great interest to me, and I wanted to understand it better.I pressed for more documentation, and the historian sent me instructions for using the Bureau of Reclamation’s image archive site as well as some keywords to search for. The black and white images you see here come from this resource. Using the convoluted web site was a challenge, and at first I had difficulty finding any photos of the plaza before or during its construction. As I discovered, the problem was that I was searching with the term “Monument Plaza,” a name only given to it after its completion in 01936. In order to find images during its construction, I had to search for “Safety Island,” so named because at the time of the dam’s construction, it was an island in the road where workers could stand behind a berm to protect themselves from the never-ending onslaught of cement trucks.I now had some historical text and photos, but I was still missing a complete diagram of the plaza that would allow me to really understand it. I contacted the historian again, and she obtained permission from her superiors to release the actual building plans. I suspect that they generally don’t like to release technical plans of the dam for security reasons, but it seems they deemed my request a low security risk as the monument is not part of the structure of the dam. The historian sent me a tube full of large blueprints and a CD of the same prints already scanned. With this in hand I was finally able to re-construct the technical intent of the plaza and how it works.In order to understand how the plaza marks the date of the dam’s construction in the nearly 26,000-year cycle of the earth’s precession, it is worth explaining what exactly axial precession is. In the simplest terms, it is the earth “wobbling” on its tilted axis like a gyroscope — but very, very slowly. This wobbling effectively moves what we see as the center point that stars appear to revolve around each evening.Presently, this center point lies very close to the conveniently bright star Polaris. The reason we have historically paid so much attention to this celestial center, or North Star, is because it is the star that stays put all through the course of the night. Having this one fixed point in the sky is the foundation of all celestial navigation.But that point near Polaris, which we call the North Star, is actually slowly moving and tracing a circle through the night sky. While Polaris is our North Star, Hansen’s terrazzo floor points out that the North Star of the ancient Egyptians, as they built the great pyramids, was Thuban. And in about 12,000 years, our North Star will be Vega. The workings of this precession are best explained with an animation, as in figure 1. Here you can see how the axis of the earth traces a circle in the sky over the course of 25,772 years.Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to see how this all works in the inlaid floor at Monument Plaza. The view that you really want to have of the plaza is directly from above. You would need a crane to get this view of the real thing, but by using the original technical drawing as an underlay I was able to mark up a diagram which hopefully clarifies it (Fig. 2).In this diagram, you can see that the center of the circle traced by the axial precession is actually the massive flag pole in the center of the plaza. This axial circle is prominently marked around the pole, and the angle of Polaris was depicted as precisely as possible to show where it would have been on the date of the dam’s opening. Hansen used the rest of the plaza floor to show the location of the planets visible that evening, and many of the bright stars that appear in the night sky at that location.By combining planet locations with the angle of precession, we are able to pinpoint the time of the dam’s completion down to within a day. We are now designing a similar system — though with moving parts — in the dials of the 10,000 Year Clock. It is likely that at least major portions of the Hoover Dam will still be in place hundreds of thousands of years from now. Hopefully the Clock will still be ticking and Hansen’s terrazzo floor will still be there, even if it continues to baffle visitors.I would like to thank Emme Woodward of the US Bureau of Reclamation for all her help in finding the original images and plans of Monument Plaza. If you have further interest in reading Hansen’s original writings about the plaza or in seeing the plans, I have uploaded all the scans to the Internet Archive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;The old order is not coming back,&apos; Carney says in speech at Davos</title><link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-davos-speech-9.7052725</link><author>martythemaniak</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:08:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a frank assessment of how he views the world in a provocative speech in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, where he said the longstanding U.S.-led, rules-based international order is over and middle powers like Canada must pivot to avoid falling prey to further "coercion" from powerful actors.Without invoking U.S. President Donald Trump by name, Carney referenced "American hegemony" and said "great powers" are using economic integration as "weapons.""Canadians know that our old, comfortable assumption that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security is no longer valid," Carney said.As it grapples with this new dynamic, Carney said Canada must be "principled and pragmatic" and turn inward to build up the country and diversify trading relationships to become less reliant on countries like the U.S., now that it's clear "integration" can lead to "subordination."Carney said multilateralism and the "architecture of collective problem-solving" — relying on institutions like the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and Conference of the Parties (COP) for climate talks — has been "diminished" and countries have to accept they may have to go it alone more often than in the recent past."Many countries are drawing the same conclusions. They must develop greater strategic autonomy: in energy, food, critical minerals, in finance and supply chains."A country that cannot feed itself, fuel itself or defend itself has few options. When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself," Carney said.WATCH | 'The old order is not coming back': PM says:Carney said this more isolationist approach, where there's a "world of fortresses," will make countries poorer, fragile and less sustainable. But it's coming nonetheless and Canada must work with like-minded allies where possible to push back against domination by larger, wealthier and well-armed countries."This is not naive multilateralism. Nor is it relying on diminished institutions. It is building the coalitions that work, issue by issue, with partners who share enough common ground to act together. Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu," Carney said.WATCH | Carney calls for middle powers to work together:"We are engaging broadly, strategically, with open eyes. We actively take on the world as it is, not wait for the world as we wish it to be," he said."The old order is not coming back. We should not mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy. But from the fracture, we can build something better, stronger and more just."Mentions defence spending, diversified tradeCarney said that since taking office, he has moved to change Canada's trajectory: doubling defence spending, rapidly diversifying trade by signing 12 trade and security deals on four continents in six months and drawing even closer to the European Union.Canada is also pursuing free trade pacts with India, Thailand, the Philippines and the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Mercosur, the South American bloc that includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay."Great powers can afford to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity, the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not. But when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating. This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination," Carney said."In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favour, or to combine to create a third path with impact."Canada a 'stable, reliable partner'While striking a skeptical tone about some global institutions and lamenting what he called a "rupture" to how things have long worked, Carney said he feels confident about Canada's future despite the shifting sands.Canada is a "stable, reliable partner" that "values relationships for the long term," which makes it appealing to other countries, he said."Canada has what the world wants. We are an energy superpower. We have the most educated population in the world," he said. "We have capital, talent and a government with the immense fiscal capacity to act decisively. And we have the values to which many others aspire."WATCH | 'We are in the midst of a rupture':Speaking later at a fireside chat at the World Economic Forum, Carney acknowledged Canada is vulnerable to an increasingly assertive U.S. given geography and longstanding economic ties.But he said Canada has already proven its resiliency in the face of a U.S. trade war: the country has added more jobs than the States since Trump slapped tariffs on global goods.Still, he said, there are "pockets of extreme pressure," a likely reference to the steel, aluminum, auto and lumber sectors that have faced particularly high U.S. tariffs.At a White House news conference to mark one year since his second inauguration, Trump cited trouble in Canada's automotive industry as one of his self-described accomplishments."A lot of the Canadian auto plants are closing, and they're moving into the United States," he said. "They can't pay the tariffs, so they're coming here."Auto assembly plants in Brampton and Ingersoll, Ont., have been idled since Trump launched his trade war. But, despite the president's rhetoric, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary data show there has actually been a contraction in auto industry jobs south of the border over the last year.Asked if cutting deals with China amid U.S. uncertainty makes Canada overly reliant on the Asian superpower, Carney said he is playing "offence" and deepening economic ties to the world's second-largest country is a prudent move at this juncture."We should have a strategic partnership with them," he said of China, while saying there will be "guardrails" in place. "You need a web of connections."WATCH | Canada 'a stable and reliable partner':As Trump insists the U.S. must take over Greenland, supposedly for national security purposes, Carney said Canada stands "firmly" with Denmark, which ultimately controls the autonomous territory."Our commitment to Article 5 is unwavering," Carney said, referring to the NATO principle of collective defence. "We are working with our NATO allies to further secure the alliance’s northern and western flanks."Speaking of the Danish territory coveted by Trump, Carney said: "I think clearly NATO is experiencing a test right now."WATCH | Carney speaks out against Greenland tariffs:He said Canada is bulking up its military presence in the Arctic while also urging "discussions" among allies to bring about a "better outcome" in the north Atlantic.Carney's remarks follow Trump's extraordinary threat to impose tariffs on European allies and Britain until Washington is allowed to acquire Greenland. The prime minister said Canada "strongly opposes" the U.S. plan to hit allies with punishing levies if they won't go along with Trump's imperialism.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta&apos;s legal team abandoned its ethical duties</title><link>https://www.afterbabel.com/p/how-metas-lawyers-perfected-the-playbook</link><author>shrubby</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:02:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In March 1770, as Boston boiled with outrage over the killing of five colonists by British soldiers, John Adams did something few could comprehend: he volunteered to defend the enemy. Adams believed that the very idea of liberty depended on ensuring that even the reviled had counsel; that a free country could not exist without an independent and impartial bar willing to defend the despised.Every lawyerImagine if Adams had decided that defending his clients meant winning at all costs. Can you imagine Bostonians’ outrage if Adams had, say, withheld evidence that the British soldiers did have murderous intent? What would Adams’s legal legacy be if he’d tried not to discover the truth of what happened outside the Custom House, but to sow doubt and uncertainty among the people of Boston? How different would our legal system be if the British soldiers were acquitted not because they were innocent, but because they had a lawyer who was willing to hide the truth?emergedemergedmillions of lives“mountains of evidence,” newly unsealed court documentsProject Mercurytestimony before the U.S. Senate this past Septembera  policy for sex trafficking accountsAccording to Sattizahn, Meta’s legal department created what he called a “funnel of manipulation” in response to these identified risks to children, a comprehensive system for controlling every aspect of safety research. Legal representatives embedded in research teams demanded destruction of findings deemed too sensitive. Researchers were forbidden to use words like “illegal” or “non-compliant” even when plainly applicable. Sattizahn and Savage’s testimony is complemented by internal communications, now public, showing that Meta employees worried they were behaving like tobacco executives “doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves.”found Attorney-client privilege was originally meant to protect candor in service of truth, but in Meta’s hands it has become a means of hiding the truth — a transformation that marks how far the legal profession has drifted. John Adams believed that truth was the lawyer’s surest refuge, the one place where all three duties could coexist. He wrote in his autobiography that his British client “must therefore expect from me no Art or Address, No Sophistry or Prevarication in such a Cause; nor any thing more than Fact, Evidence and Law would justify.” When lawyers abandon fact, evidence, and law, and turn their craft toward suppression instead, they corrode the foundation of public trust on which the entire legal system depends. Judge Williams’ ruling is thus more than a procedural rebuke; it is a reminder that the law’s legitimacy survives only so long as truth remains discoverable.Yet Judge Williams’ ruling alone cannot stop Meta’s institutional misdeeds. Meta has thrived in an environment of passivity, thanks to lawyers who refuse to report ethical misconduct, bar associations that decline to investigate despite court findings of probable cause and reams of evidence in the public domain, legislators who prefer theater to legislation, and influential business leaders from other sectors who remain silent bystanders as tech lawyers remake the legal system into one that rewards grift and exploitation rather than enterprise and innovation.Impunity is not inevitable. State bar associations should open investigations tomorrow and revoke reciprocity to Meta attorneys licensed in other jurisdictions. The evidence is public: testimony under oath, a judge’s finding of probable cause, court documents that speak for themselves. Investigations for potential disbarment should begin with senior leaders like Jennifer Newstead and Joel Kaplan, Meta’s respective heads of legal and public policy who bear responsibility under ethics rules for attorneys working under them.Junior lawyers at the company who may have witnessed this systematic obstruction and failed to report it should also be scrutinized, as the rules of professional responsibility generally require lawyers to report professional misconduct by another lawyer “that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness.” That none reported what they witnessed demands investigation at the very least. A stint in Meta’s legal department on a lawyer’s resume should be considered disqualifying by law firms and other future employers, making that lawyer unhireable if they cannot show that they spoke up about, or were otherwise unaware of, the suppression of evidence or harm. The fear of real consequences for playing a role in perpetrating such massive harm to American children should force Meta’s attorneys to either leave the company or to begin to stand up for what’s right. OpenAI’s lawyers “accidentally” erased evidence Google Apple wrote of the tobacco lawyers two decades agoThe machinery for accountability exists. State bars can act tomorrow to investigate and suspend Meta’s attorneys. Judges can continue piercing false privilege claims and issue sanctions against bad-faith advocates. Legislators can demand bar associations justify their continued self-regulation and reform the rules of attorney-client privilege for corporations. Law firms can fire clients that ask them to violate their broader duties to the country and its courts. Importantly, holding corrupt, unethical lawyers accountable for enabling harms to children does not mean that we sacrifice the foundational tenet of the American legal system that John Adams championed: that even those we may despise — the redcoat soldier then, the billionaire and his exploitative empires now — will remain entitled to counsel who will zealously defend them, provided they follow the rules that the rest of us do.industrial scaleHolding Meta accountable includes holding its lawyers accountable; the harm the company inflicts on young people could not exist without lawyers willing to enable it. Defrocking those lawyers could be what ends the impunity for Mark Zuckerberg, his lieutenants, and his empire.The truth will out for Meta’s lawyers — eventually — as happened with Big Tobacco’s, but the stakes reach beyond any single company’s malfeasance or any one attorney’s lack of conscience. Just as tobacco lawyers’ corruption poisoned public trust, Meta’s attorneys threaten to complete the transformation of law into a service available only to those wealthy enough to corrupt it and shameless enough to ignore the wreckage. Whether courts can function, whether Americans believe law serves justice rather than a system many believe to be rigged, depends on whether those in power repudiate this conduct decisively, or whether they continue, through their inaction, to tacitly endorse it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Unix Pipe Card Game</title><link>https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/</link><author>kykeonaut</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:48:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It’s kind of fun looking back since we were only a few months into building at the time. The HN community gave a lot of enthusiasm and some helpful feedback.Today, we released Mastra 1.0 in stable, so we wanted to come back and talk about what’s changed.If you’re new to Mastra, it's an open-source TypeScript agent framework that also lets you create multi-agent workflows, run evals, inspect in a local studio, and emit observability.Since our last post, Mastra has grown to over 300k weekly npm downloads and 19.4k GitHub stars. It’s now Apache 2.0 licensed and runs in prod at companies like Replit, PayPal, and Sanity.Agent development is changing quickly, so we’ve added a lot since February:- Native model routing: You can access 600+ models from 40+ providers by specifying a model string (e.g., `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`) with TS autocomplete and fallbacks.- Guardrails: Low-latency input and output processors for prompt injection detection, PII redaction, and content moderation. The tricky thing here was the low-latency part.- Scorers: An async eval primitive for grading agent outputs. Users were asking how they should do evals. We wanted to make it easy to attach to Mastra agents, runnable in Mastra studio, and save results in Mastra storage.- Plus a few other features like AI tracing (per-call costing for Langfuse, Braintrust, etc), memory processors, a `.network()` method that turns any agent into a routing agent, and server adapters to integrate Mastra within an existing Express/Hono server.(That last one took a bit of time, we went down the ESM/CJS bundling rabbithole, ran into lots of monorepo issues, and ultimately opted for a more explicit approach.)Anyway, we'd love for you to try Mastra out and let us know what you think. You can get started with `npm create mastra@latest`.We'll be around and happy to answer any questions!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>De-dollarization: Is the US dollar losing its dominance? (2025)</title><link>https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/currencies/de-dollarization</link><author>andsoitis</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:03:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There are two main factors that could erode the dollar’s status. The first includes adverse events that undermine the perceived safety and stability of the greenback — and the U.S.’s overall standing as the world’s leading economic, political and military power. For instance, increased polarization in the U.S. could jeopardize its governance, which underpins its role as a global safe haven. Ongoing U.S. tariff policy could also cause investors to lose confidence in American assets.The second factor involves positive developments outside the U.S. that boost the credibility of alternative currencies — economic and political reforms in China, for example. “A candidate reserve currency must be perceived as safe and stable and must provide a source of liquidity that is sufficient to meet growing global demand,” said Alexander Wise, who covers Long-Term Strategy at J.P. Morgan.Fundamentally, de-dollarization could shift the balance of power among countries, and this could, in turn, reshape the global economy and markets. The impact would be most acutely felt in the U.S., where de-dollarization would likely lead to a broad depreciation and underperformance of U.S. financial assets versus the rest of the world.“For U.S. equities, outright and relative returns would be negatively impacted by divestment or reallocation away from U.S. markets and a severe loss in confidence. There would also likely be upward pressure on real yields due to the partial divestment of U.S. fixed income by investors, or the diversification or reduction of international reserve allocations,” Wise said. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia Stock Crash Prediction</title><link>https://entropicthoughts.com/nvidia-stock-crash-prediction</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:56:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
To keep things computationally simple, we are going to use a binomial model for
the price of the underlying Nvidia stock. We don’t know the daily volatility, so
we’ll keep that as a variable we call \(\sigma\). We will pretend that each day,
the Nvidia stock price can either grow with a factor of \(e^\sigma\) or shrink
with a factor of \(e^{-\sigma}\).
Thus, on day zero, the Nvidia stock trades for $184. On day one, it can take one
of two values:
\(184e^\sigma\) because it went up, or\(184e^{-\sigma}\) because it went down.
On day two, it can have one of three values:
\(184e^{2\sigma}\) (went up both in the first and second day),\(184e^{\sigma - \sigma} = 184\) (went up and then down, or vice versa), or\(184e^{-2\sigma}\) (went down both days).
If it’s easier, we can visualise this as a tree. Each day, the stock price
branches into two possibilities, one where it rises, and one where it goes down.
In the graph below, each column of bubbles represents the closing value for a
day.

This looks like a very crude approximation, but it actually works if the time
steps are fine-grained enough. The uncertainties involved in some of the other
estimations we’ll do dwarf the inaccuracies introduced by this model.
It is important to keep in mind that the specific numbers in the bubbles depend
on which number we selected for the daily volatility \(\sigma\). Any conclusion we
draw from this tree is a function of the specific \(\sigma\) chosen to construct
the tree.

When we have chosen an initial \(\sigma\) and constructed this tree, we can price
an option using it. Maybe we have a call option expiring on day three, with a
strike price of $180. On day four, the last day, the option has expired, so it
is worth nothing. We’ll put that into the tree.

We have already seen what the value of the option is on the day it expires: it’s
what we would profit from exercising it. If the stock is valued at $191, the
option is worth $11, the difference between the stock value and the strike
price. On the other hand, if the stock is valued at $177, it is worth less than
the strike price of the option, so we will  exercise the option, instead
letting it expire.

The day before the expiration day is when we have the first interesting choice
to make. We can still exercise the option, with the exercise value of the
option calculated the same way.

Or we could hold on to the option. If we hold on to the option for a day, the
value of the option will either go up or down, depending on the value of the
underlying stock price. We will compute a weighted average of these movement
possibilities as

\[\tilde{p} V_u + (1 - \tilde{p}) V_d\]

where \(V_u\) and \(V_d\) are the values the option will have on the next day when
the underlying moves up or down in the tree, respectively. Then we’ll discount
this with a safe interest rate to account for
the fact that by holding the option, we are foregoing cash that could otherwise
be used to invest elsewhere. The general equation for the hold value of the
option at any time before the expiration day is

\[e^{-r} \left[ \tilde{p} \; V_u + (1 - \tilde{p}) V_d \right].\]

Let’s look specifically at the node where the stock value is $199. We’ll assume
a safe interest rate of 3.6 % annually, which translates to 0.01 % daily. The value of holding on to the option is, then

\[0.9999 \left[ \tilde{p} \; 26.97 + (1 - \tilde{p}) 11.36 \right]\]

and now we only need to know what \(\tilde{p}\) is. That variable looks and
behaves a lot like a probability, but it’s not. There’s an arbitrage argument
that fixes the value of \(\tilde{p}\) to

\[\tilde{p} = \frac{e^r - e^{-\sigma}}{e^\sigma - e^{-\sigma}}\]

where \(\sigma\) is the same time step volatility we assumed when creating the
tree – in our case, 4 %. This makes \(\tilde{p} = 0.491\), and with this, we can
compute the hold value of the option when the underlying is $199:

The value of the option at any point in time is the maximum of the hold value
and the exercise value. So we replace the stock value of $199 in the tree with
the option value of $19.03. We perform the same calculation for the other nodes
in day two.

and then we do the same for the day before that, then before that, etc., until
we get to day zero.

We learn that if someone asks us on day zero to buy a call option with a strike
price of $180 and expiry three days later, when the underlying stock currently
trades for $184, and has an expected daily volatility of 0.04, then we should be
willing to pay $7.38 for that option.

What’s weird is this number has  to do with the probability we are
assigning to up or down movements. Go through the calculations again. We never
involved any probability in the calculation of the price. Although I won’t go
through the argument – see Shreve’s excellent Stochastic Calculus for
Finance for that – this price for the option is based
on what it would cost to hedge the option with a portfolio of safe investments,
borrowing, and long or short positions in the underlying stock.

Even without going through the detailed theory, we can fairly quickly verify
that this is indeed how options are priced. Above, we made educated guesses as
to the safe interest rate, a reasonable volatility, etc. We calculated with a
spot price of $184, a strike price of $180, and expiry three days out. We got an
option price of $7.38.

At the time of writing, the Nvidia stock trades at $184.94. It has options that

Conventional techniques are effective, but sometimes being creative can really pay off!In this article, I present unconventional optimization techniques in PostgreSQL.Imagine you have this table of users:For each user you keep their name and which payment plan they're on. There are only two plans, "free" and "pro", so you add a check constraint.Generate some data and analyze the table:You now have 100K users in the system.Now you want to let your analysts access this table in their reporting tool of choice. You give one of the analysts permission, and this is the first query they write:The query returned no results, and the analyst is baffled. How come there are no users on the "Pro" plan?The name of the plan is "pro" and not "Pro" (with a capital "P") as the analyst wrote it. This is an honest mistake really, anyone can make such a mistake! But what is the  of this mistake?Examine the execution plan of a query for a non-existing value:PostgreSQL scanned the entire table! However, there's a check constraint on the field - no row can ever have the value "Pro", the database makes sure of that! So if this condition always evaluates to false, why is PostgreSQL scanning the table?PostgreSQL is smart enough to skip a table scan when the query contains a condition that always evaluates to false, but not by default! To instruct PostgreSQL to look at constraints when generating a plan, you need to set the parameter :Nice! After turning  on, PostgreSQL figured out based on the check constraint that the condition won't return any rows, and skipped the scan entirely.So who are you  and why are you not on by default?Currently, constraint exclusion is enabled by default only for cases that are often used to implement table partitioning via inheritance trees. Turning it on for all tables imposes extra planning overhead that is quite noticeable on simple queries, and most often will yield no benefit for simple queries.The parameter  is set to "partition" by default, where it's used to eliminate entire partitions when querying against a partitioned table - this is known as "partition pruning".The documentation states that for simple queries the cost of evaluating all relevant conditions against all the relevant constraints might outweigh the benefit - you might end up spending more time planning than actually executing the query. It makes sense that queries executed by a system are less likely to query for invalid values or apply conditions that go against constraints. However, this is not the case for ad-hoc queries in reporting tools...In BI and reporting environments users can issue complicated queries that are often crafted by hand. In this type of environment, it's not unlikely that they'll make mistakes, just like our analyst did before. Setting  to "on" in reporting and data warehouse environments where users can issue ad-hoc queries can potentially save time and resources by eliminating unnecessary full table scans.Imagine you have a sales table that looks like this:You keep track of when the sale was made and how much was charged. Create 10 million sales and analyze the table:Your analysts often produce daily sales reports and their queries can look roughly like this:PostgreSQL scanned the entire table and the query completed in ~627ms. Your analysts are a bit spoiled and ~600ms is too slow for them, so you do what you always do in these cases and "slap a B-Tree index on it":Execute the query with the index:Execution time reduced from ~627ms to 187ms and the analysts are happy, but at what cost?The index is 214 MB! That's almost half the size of the entire table. So the analysts are happy, but you? Not so much...Slapping a B-Tree index is very common, but DBAs and developers often ignore the storage cost and the maintenance burden that comes with it. Using simple measures, we can potentially save some space and money.Let's step back and re-think what we were trying to optimize. Analysts wanted to produce  reports, but we provided them with an index that can produce results at a millisecond precision. By indexing the date and the time, we gave the analysts a lot more than what they asked for!What if instead of indexing the entire datetime, we index just the date, without the time?First, check the size of the indexes:The function-based index is just 66MB, that's more than 3 times smaller than the full index. While a  is smaller than a  -- 4 bytes vs. 8 bytes -- this is actually not where the majority of the savings come from. The function-based index has , so PostgreSQL can optimize its size using deduplication.To check if we can make better use of the smaller index, we start by dropping the full index:To allow our query to use the function-based index we make some adjustments to the query (we'll tackle that later!):The index was used and the query completed in just 145ms, that's ~20ms faster then using the full index, and x4.5 time faster than the full table scan.Using a function based index can be fragile. If we make even the slightest adjustment to the expression, the database won't be able to use the index:The query is the same as the previous, but we changed the expression from using  to using , so the database was unable to use the function-based index.Using the exact same expression requires a certain level of discipline that doesn't realistically exist in any organization. It's borderline naive to expect this to be useful this way - we need to come up with a way to force the use of this exact expression.The old way of doing this involved a view:The view adds a new calculated column called "sold_at_date" that uses the exact same expression we used to define the function-based index. Using the view, we can guarantee that we allow the database to use the index:The index is used and the query is fast! Cool, but...Views are definitely a viable solution here, but they suffer from the same discipline problem - the analysts can still use the table directly (and they will!). We can revoke access from the table or do some magic tricks with  to fool them into using the view, but there is an easier way.Starting at version 14, PostgreSQL supports generated columns - these are columns that are automatically populated with an expression when we insert the row. Sounds exactly like what we need but there is a caveat - the result of the expression is materialized - this means additional storage, which is what we were trying to save in the first place!Lucky for us, starting with version 18, PostgreSQL supports  generated columns. A virtual column looks like a regular column, but it's actually an expression that's being evaluated every time it is accessed. Basically, what we tried to achieve before with a view!First, add a virtual generated column to the table with the same expression we indexed:Next, execute the query using the virtual generated column:Using the virtual generated column we can make sure the expression used in the query is the exact same expression we indexed. PostgreSQL is then able to use the index, and the query is fast.There are several advantages to this approach:: fewer distinct values means the database can use deduplication to make the index smaller.: the small and specific index requires less resources so the query is faster.: using the generated column is straight forward and the index is guaranteed to be useable.: making sure anyone on the team uses the same exact expression is prone to errors and discrepancies, especially when time zones are involved. Using a virtual generated column eliminates this ambiguity.The next logical step would be to create the index directly on the virtual column. Unfortunately, as of writing this article, PostgreSQL 18 does not support indexes on virtual generated columns:Imagine you have a system that extracts information from URLs. You create a table to keep track:Processing web pages can be resource intensive, time consuming and expensive, so you want to make sure you don't process the same page more than once.To make sure URLs are not processed more than once you add a unique constraint on the  column:You can now rest assured that you don't process the exact URL more than once:The unique constraint is enforced using a unique B-Tree index, so you also get the nice perk of being able to search for a specific URL very quickly:Web pages these days can have pretty big URLs. Some web apps even go as far as storing the entire application state in the URL. This is great for users, but not so great if you need to store these URLs.Check the size of the table and the B-Tree index used to enforce the unique constraint:The size of the table is 160MB and the size of the index is a staggering 154MB!A B-Tree index stores the indexed values themselves in the leaf blocks, so when indexing large values, the B-Tree index can get very large.PostgreSQL offers another type of index called a Hash index. This type of index does not store the actual values. Instead, it stores the hash values which can be much smaller. I wrote about Hash indexes in the past so I wont repeat myself. I would just say that indexing large values with very few repetition is where the Hash index truly shines!A Hash index sounds like a reasonable way to enforce a unique constraint, so let's try to create a unique hash index:Oh no! PostgreSQL does not support unique hash indexes, but this doesn't mean we can't still enforce uniqueness using a Hash index...PostgreSQL offers a special type of constraint called an exclusion constraint. This lesser-known and not-so-widely-used constraint is often mentioned in combination with a GIN or GiST index as a way to prevent overlapping ranges. However, using an exclusion constraint we can effectively enforce uniqueness using a Hash index:This adds an exclusion constraint on the table that prevents two rows with the same URL - this guarantees uniqueness. The exclusion constraint is enforced using a Hash index - this means we effectively enforce uniqueness with a Hash index!First, verify that uniqueness is indeed enforced:Attempting to add a row with a URL that already exists failed with an exclusion constraint violation. Good.Next, can this Hash index be useful for queries that filter for specific urls?Yes it can, and in this case it's even faster than using the B-Tree index (0.022ms vs 0.046ms).Finally, compare the size of the B-Tree and the Hash index:Amazing! The Hash index is x5 smaller than the corresponding B-Tree index. Instead of storing those large URLs in the B-Tree leaf blocks, the Hash index stores only the hash values which results in a significantly smaller index.Using an exclusion constraint to enforce uniqueness with a Hash index can potentially save storage and make queries faster. However, there are a few caveats to consider with this approach:⚠️ Column cannot be referenced by foreign keysPostgreSQL requires that a foreign key reference a unique constraint. Since we can't define a unique hash constraint, we can't point a foreign key to it:⚠️ Limitations on The  clause in an  command is common and very useful for syncing data. Unfortunately, using exclusion constraints with this clause can have some rough edges.Attempting to use an exclusion constraint with a list of fields in an ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING clause can fail:The message suggests that it should be possible to use an exclusion, and it is, but using the ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT clause instead:Trying the same with ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE is not possible at all, even when using ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT:I'm not a big fan of using the constraint names in SQL, so to overcome both limitations I'de use  instead:Finally, check the execution plan to verify that the statement is capable of using the Hash index:Despite these minor limitations and inconveniences, a Hash index is a good candidate for enforcing uniqueness of large values that don't need to be referenced by foreign keys.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IP Addresses Through 2025</title><link>https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2026-01/addr2025.html</link><author>petercooper</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:51:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's time for another annual roundup from the world of IP addresses. Let’s see what has changed in the past 12 months in addressing the Internet and look at how IP address allocation information can inform us of the changing nature of the network itself.Back around 1992, the IETF gazed into their crystal ball and tried to understand how the Internet was going to evolve and what demands that would place on the addressing system as part of the “IP Next Generation” study.  The staggeringly large numbers of connected devices that we see today were certainly within the range predicted by that study. The assumption made at the time was that we would continue to use much the same IP protocol architecture, including the requirement that each connected device was assigned a unique IP address, and the implication was that the 32-bit address field defined in version 4 of the IP protocol was clearly going to be inadequate to cope with the predicted number of connected devices. A span of 4 billion address values was just not large enough.We concluded at the time that the only way we could make the Internet work across such a massive pool of connected devices was to deploy a new IP protocol that came with a massively larger address space. It was from this reasoning that IPv6 was designed, as this world of abundant silicon processors connected to a single public Internet was the scenario that IPv6 was primarily intended to solve. The copious volumes of a 128-bit address space were intended to allow us to uniquely assign a public IPv6 address to every such device, no matter how small, or in whatever volume they might be deployed.But while the Internet has grown at amazing speeds across the ensuing 33 years, the deployment of IPv6 has proceeded at a more measured pace. There is still no evidence of any common sense of urgency about the deployment of IPv6 in the public Internet, and still there is no common agreement that the continued reliance on IPv4 is failing us.Much of the reason for this apparent contradiction between the addressed device population of the IPv4 Internet and the actual count of connected devices, which is of course many times larger, is that through the 1990's the Internet rapidly changed from a peer-to-peer architecture to a client/server framework. Clients can initiate network transactions with servers but are incapable of initiating transactions with other clients. Servers are capable of completing connection requests from clients, but cannot initiate such connections with clients. Network Address Translators (NATs) are a natural fit to this client/server model, where pools of clients share a smaller pool of public addresses, and only require the use of an address once they have initiated an active session with a remote server. NATs are the reason why a pool of excess of 30 billion connected devices can be squeezed into a far smaller pool of some 3 billion advertised IPv4 addresses. Services and Applications that cannot work behind NATs are no longer useful in the context of the public Internet and no longer used as a result. In essence, what we did was to drop the notion that an IP address is uniquely associated with a device's identity, and the resultant ability to share addresses across clients largely alleviated the immediacy of the IPv4 addressing problem for the Internet.However, the pressures of this inexorable growth in the number of deployed devices connected to the Internet implies that the even NATs cannot absorb these growth pressures forever. NATs can extend the effective addressable space in IPv4 by up to 32 ‘extra’ bits using mapping of the 16-bit source and destination port fields of the TCP and UDP headers, and they also enable the time-based sharing of these public addresses. Both of these measures are effective in stretching the IPv4 address space to encompass a larger client device pool, but they do not transform the finite IP address space into an infinitely elastic resource. The inevitable outcome of this process, if it were to be constrained to operate solely within IPv4, is that we would see the fragmenting of the IPv4 Internet into a number of disconnected parts, probably based on the service ‘cones’ of the various points of presence of the content distribution servers, so that the entire concept of a globally unique and coherent address pool layered over a single coherent packet transmission realm would be foregone.Alternatively, we may see these growth pressures motivate the further deployment of IPv6, and the emergence of IPv6-only elements of the Internet as the network itself tries to maintain a cohesive and connected whole. There are commercial pressures pulling the network in both of these directions, so it’s entirely unclear what path the Internet will follow in the coming years, but my (admittedly cynical and perhaps overly jaded) personal opinion lies in a future of highly fragmented network, as least in terms of the underlying packet connectivity protocol.Can address allocation data help us to shed some light on what is happening in the larger Internet? Let’s look at what happened in 2025.It appears that the process of exhausting the remaining pools of unallocated IPv4 addresses is proving to be as protracted as the process of the transition to IPv6, although by the end of 2021 the end of the old registry allocation model had effectively occurred with the depletion of the residual pools of unallocated addresses in each of the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).It is difficult to talk about “allocations” in today’s Internet. There are still a set of transactions where addresses are drawn from the residual pools of RIR-managed available address space and allocated or assigned to network operators, but at the same time there are also a set of transactions where addresses are traded between network in what is essentially a "sale". These address transfers necessarily entail a change of registration details, so the registry records the outcome of a transfer, or sale, in a manner that is similar to an allocation or assignment.If we want to look at the larger picture of the amount of IPv4 address space that is used or usable by Internet network operators, then perhaps the best metric to use is the total span of allocated and assigned addresses, and the consequent indication of annual change in the change in this total address span from year to year.What is the difference between "allocated" and "assigned"?When a network operator or sub-registry has received an  it can further delegate that IP address space to their customers along with using it for their own internal infrastructure. When a network operator has received an  this can only be used for their own internal infrastructure. [https://help.apnic.net/s/article/Using-address-space]I personally find the distinction between these two terms somewhat of an artifice these days, so from here on I’ll use the term “allocation" to describe both allocations and assignments.The total IPv4 allocated address pool contracted by some 237 thousand addresses in 2025, with some 3.687 billion allocated addresses at the end of the year. This represented a contraction of some 0.01% for the total allocated IPv4 public address pool through 2025 (Table 1).Table 1 - IPv4 Allocated addresses by YearHave we exhausted all the available sources of further IPv4 addresses? The address management model is that unallocated addresses are held in a single pool by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, and blocks of addresses are passed to RIRs, who then allocate them to various end entities, either for their own use or for further allocation. The IANA exhausted the last of its available address pools some years ago, and these days it holds just 3 /24 address prefixes, and has done do for the past 13 years. Because the option of dividing this tiny address pool into 5 equal chunks of 153.6 individual address is not viable, then these 768 individual IPv4 addresses are likely to sit in the IANA Recovered Address registry for some time.That is, until one of more of the RIRs return more prefixes recovered from the old “legacy" allocated addresses to the IANA, who would then be able to divide the pool equally and distribute them to each the 5 RIRs. This is unlikely to occur.There are also addresses that have been marked by the IANA as  for "special uses"". This includes blocks of addresses reserved for Multicast use. At the top end of the IPv4 address space registry there is a set of addresses that are marked as reserved for "Future Use"". This is a relatively large pool of 268,435,456 addresses (the old former “Class E" space) and if ever there was a “future" for IPv4 then it has well and truly come and gone. But exactly how to unlock this space and return it to the general use pool is a problem that so far has not found a generally workable solution, although efforts to do so have surfaced in the community from time to time.The topic of releasing the Class E space for use in the public Internet as globally routable unicast address space has been raised from time to time over the past 15 years or so. Some Internet drafts were published for the IETF’s consideration that either directly proposed releasing this space for use, or outlined the impediments in various host and router implementations that were observed to exist in 2008 when these drafts were being developed.The proposals lapsed, probably due to the larger consideration at the time that the available time and resources to work on these issues were limited and the result of effort spent in ‘conditioning’ this IPv4 space for general use was only going to obtain a very small extension in the anticipated date of depletion of the remaining IPv4 address pools, while the same amount of effort spent on working on advancing IPv6 deployment was assumed to have a far larger beneficial outcome.As the IANA is no longer a source of addresses, then we need to look at the RIR practices to see the life cycle of addresses from the registry’s perspective. When IP address space is returned to the RIR or reclaimed by the RIR according to the RIR’s policies it is normally placed in a RIR-reserved pool for a period of time and marked as reserved by the RIR. Marking returned or recovered addresses as reserved for a period of time allows various address prefix reputation and related services, including routing records, some time to record the cessation of the previous state of the addresses prefix, prior to any subsequent allocation. Following this quarantine period, which has been between some months and some years, this reserved space is released for re-use.The record of annual year-on-year change in allocated addresses per RIR over the same fourteen-year period is shown in Table 2. There are some years when the per-RIR pool of allocated addresses shrunk is size. This is generally due to inter-RIR movement of addresses, due to administrative changes in some instances and inter-RIR address transfers in others. Table 2 – Annual change in IPv4 Allocated addresses (millions) - Distribution by RIREach of the RIRs are running through their final pools of IPv4 addresses. At the end of 2025, across the RIR system there are some 3.9 million addresses are in the Available Pool, held mainly in APNIC (3.1 million) and AFRINIC (773 thousand). Some 11.2 million addresses are marked as Reserved, with 5.6 million held by ARIN and 4.5 million addresses held by AFRINIC. As seen in Table 3, there has been a reduction in the Reserved Pool for all RIRs, except AFRINIC, and the major reductions were seen in APNIC (1.7M) and ARIN (600K) in ARIN (98K).Table 3 – IPv4 Available and Reserved Pools, December 2023 – December 2025The RIR IPv4 address allocation volumes by year are shown in Figure 1, but it is challenging to understand precisely what is meant by an allocation across the entire RIR system as there are some subtle but important differences between RIRs, particularly as they relate to the handling of transfers of IPv4 addresses.In the case of ARIN, a transfer between two ARIN-serviced entities is conceptually treated as two distinct transactions: a return of the addresses to the ARIN registry and a new allocation from ARIN. The date of the transfer is recorded as the new allocation date in the records published by the RIR. Other RIRs treat an address transfer in a manner analogous to a change of the nominated holder of the already-allocated addresses, and when processing a transfer, the RIR’s records preserve the original allocation date for the transferred addresses. When we look at the individual transaction records in the published RIR data, and collect then by year, then in the case of ARIN the collected data includes the volume of transferred addresses that were processed in that year, while the other RIRs only include the allocations performed in that year.In order to provide a view across the entire system, it's necessary to use an analysis approach that can compensate for these differences in the ways RIRs record address transactions. In this study, an  is defined here as a state transition in the registry records from  or  to an  state. This is intended to separate out the various actions associated with processing address transfers, which generally involve no visible state change, as the transferred address block remains  across the transfer, from address allocations. This is how the data used to generate Figure 1 has been generated from the RIR published data, comparing the status of the address pools at the end of each year to that of the status at the start of the year. An allocation in that year is identified as  in that year if the address block was not registered as  at the start of the year.Figure 1 – IPv4 Address Allocations by RIR by yearThe number of RIR IPv4 allocations by year, once again generated by using the same data analysis technique as used for Figure 1, are shown in Figure 2.Figure 2 – IPv4 Allocations by RIR by yearIt is clear from these two figures that the average size of an IPv4 address allocation has shrunk considerably in recent years, corresponding to the various IPv4 address exhaustion policies in each of the RIRs.What's Left in the IPv4 Address Pools?To recap, when addresses are held by an RIR they are classified into one of three states:, indicating that the address block is available for allocation under the terms of the prevailing address allocation policies adopted by the community that is served by that RIR,, indicating that the address block has been allocated to an entity, and, indicating that the address block is held by the RIR, but is not available for allocation at this point in time. The  category covers a number of scenarios, depending on the RIR's procedures, including the holding of an address block in a form of quarantine after its recovery by the RIR before declaring the address to be available.The pool size of available addresses over the past five years for each RIR is shown Figure 3.Figure 3 – IPv4 Available Pool Sizes by RIR by day – 2020 - 2026Only APNIC and AFRINIC are operating with relatively large pools of  addresses. At the start of 2026 APNIC had some 2,849 address blocks in its registry that were marked as , with a total pool size of 3.095M addresses. AFRINIC has 19 address blocks similarly marked, with a total pool size of 0.765M addresses. For both of these RIRs, the allocation rates from these pools are small, and even without any further returns of addresses these  address pools will likely last from some years to come at current allocation rates.There are some 11.169M addresses in the RIRs'  address pools. Between 2020 and 2025 APNIC reduced the size of its  address pool by some 4M addresses, and the current  pool is 0.454M addresses in APNIC. Both RIPE NCC and LACNIC have similarly small  address pools these days. The majority of the total pool of  address space lies with AFRINIC, which has 543 separate  address blocks with a total span of 4.481M addresses, and ARIN, which has 3,765 such address blocks with a total span of 5.2865M addresses. The AFRINIC pool size has been slowly increasing in size, while the ARIN pool size was declining up to 2025, and increased in size through 2025 (Figure 4).
Figure 4 – IPv4 Reserved Pool Sizes by RIR by day – 2020 - 2026At the start of 2026, 45% of the total pool of 3.687B  IPv4 addresses are held in ARIN's registry, 24% in APNIC's registry, 23% in the RIPE NCC, 5% in LACNIC and 3% in ARINIC.The RIRs permit the registration of IPv4 transfers between address holders, as a means of allowing secondary re-distribution of addresses as an alternative to returning unused addresses to the registry. This has been in response to the issues raised by IPv4 address exhaustion, where the underlying motivation as to encourage the reuse of otherwise idle or inefficiently used address blocks through the incentives provided by a market for addresses, and to ensure that such address movement is publicly recorded in the registry system.The number of registered transfers in the past eleven years is shown in Table 4. This number of transfers includes both inter-RIR and intra-RIR transfers. It also includes both the merger and acquisition-based transfers and the other grounds for of address transfers. Each transfer is treated as a single transaction, and in the case of inter-RIR transfers, this is accounted in the receiving RIR’s totals.Table 4 - IPv4 Address Transfers per yearThe differences between RIRs reported numbers are interesting. The policies relating to address transfers do not appear to have been adopted to any significant extent by address holders in AFRINIC and LACNIC serviced regions, while uptake in the RIPE NCC service region appears to be very enthusiastic!A slightly different view is that of the volume of addresses transferred per year (Table 5).Table 5 – Volume of Transferred IPv4 Addresses per year (Millions of addresses)A plot of these numbers is shown in Figures 5 and 6.Figure 5 – Number of Transfers: 2013 - 2025Figure 6 – Volume of Transferred Addresses: 2013 - 2025The volumes of transferred addresses reached a peak in 2022 and declined in 2023. In the case of APNIC the peak occurred in 2020, and the APNIC 2024 volume is comparable to the volume transferred in 2013. In the ARIN region address transfers are growing in total volume, while in APINC the volume of IPv4 address transfers has largely waned.The aggregate total of addresses that have been listed in these transfer logs since 2012 is some 342 million addresses, or the equivalent of 20.4 /8s, which is some 9.3% of the total delegated IPv4 address space of 3.7 billion addresses. However, that figure is likely to be an overestimate, as a number of address blocks have been transferred multiple times over this period.  Are Transfers Performing Unused Address Recovery?This data raises some questions about the nature of transfers. The first question is whether address transfers have managed to be effective in dredging the pool of allocated but unadvertised public IPv4 addresses and recycling these addresses back into active use.It was thought that by being able to monetize these addresses, holders of such addresses may have been motivated to convert their networks to use private addresses and resell their holding of public addresses. In other words, the opening of a market in addresses would provide incentive for otherwise unproductive address assets to be placed on the market. Providers who had a need for addresses would compete with other providers who had a similar need in bidding to purchase these addresses. In conventional market theory the most efficient user of addresses (here “most efficient” is based on the ability to use addresses to generate the greatest revenue) would be able to set the market price. Otherwise unused addresses would be put to productive use, and as long as demand outstrips supply the most efficient use of addresses is promoted by the actions of the market. In theory.However, the practical experience with transfers is not so clear. The data relating to address re-cycling is inconclusive. In the period 2000 to 2010, the pool of unadvertised assigned IP4 addresses increased in size from 600M to 900M addresses, which was almost one third of the assigned address pool. In the ensuring 11 years to pool of unadvertised assigned addresses fell to around 800M addresses, with the bulk of that reduction occurring in 2015. There was a substantial reduction in the size of this unadvertised address pool at the start of 2021, due to the announcement in the Internet’s routing system of some seven /8s from the address space originally allocated to the US Department of Defence in the early days of the ARPANET. At the end of 2021 AS749 originated more IPv4 addresses than any other network, namely some 211,581,184 addresses, or the equivalent of a /4.34 in prefix length notation, or some 5% of the total IPv4 address pool. Across 2022 and 2023 the previous trend of an increasing pool of unadvertised addresses resumed. On December 12 2024, a total of some 81,224,704 addresses (the equivalent of 4.8 /8s) was advertised by ASes operated by Amazon, mainly AS16509, bringing the total pool of unadvertised addresses down to a level last observed in the year 2000. Across 2025 the pool of unadvertised assigned IP4 addresses has increased slightly (Figure 7).Figure 7 – IPv4 Unadvertised Address Pool SizeThe larger picture of the three IPv4 address pool sizes, ,  and  address pools since the start of 2000 is shown in Figure 6. The onset of more restrictive address policies coincides with the exhaustion of the central IANA unallocated address pool in early 2011, and the period since that date has seen the RIRs run down their address pools.Figure 8 – IPv4 Address Pools  2000 - 2025We can also look at the year 2025, looking at the changes in these address pools since the start of the year, as shown in Figure 9. The total span of advertised addresses fell by a total of 10M addresses through the year.Figure 9 – IPv4 Address Pool changes through 2025That change in the blue trace in Figure 9, the total allocated address pool, can be attributed to LACNIC, where some 7M addresses were market as available through March 2025, and then passed back into the advertised pool in early April 2025.Four of the major step changes through the year in the advertised address span (5 January, 5 May, 5 November and 11 December) can be attributed to AS16509 (Amazon 02), and the day-by-day record of the total address span advertised by this AS is shown in Figure 10. Amazon has advertised a total of an additional 12M addresses through 2025, peaking at 168M addresses at the start of November. On the 5th November, Amazon stopped announcing a collection of prefixes with a total span of 15.744M addresses. A month later, on the 10th December some 5.039 M additional addresses were announced bringing the total span of addresses announce by AS16509 Amazon at the year's end to 157.425 addresses, just 2.777M more than the 154.763M addresses that were announced at the start of 2025.Figure 10 – Total advertised address span for AS16509 (Amazon-O2) through 2025In relative terms, expressed as a proportion of the total pool of allocated IP addresses, the unadvertised address pool peaked at 38% of the total assigned address pool in early 2003, and then declined over the ensuing 15 years to a relatively low value of 22% at the start of 2018. The ratio has been steadily climbing since that date, with abrupt falls due to the advertisement of the legacy US Department of Defence address space in 2021, and the Amazon address announcements in December 2024 (Figure 11). The unadvertised address space now sits at some 16% of the total assigned address pool.Figure 11 – Ratio of Unadvertised Pool Size to Total Pool Size: 2000 - 2026The data behind Figure 11 gives the impression of a steady effort to recycle otherwise idle IP addresses over the past twenty-five years, and to a certain extent this has been the case. However, the large drop in this ratio in early 2021 was due to the moves by the US DoD to advertise their address holdings to the public Internet, and the large drop in late 2024 was due to Amazon announcing address space that it had previously acquired.The transfer data points to a somewhat sluggish transfer market. The number of transfer transactions is rising, but the total volume of transferred addresses is falling for most RIRs, with the exception of the RIPE NCC (Tables 4 and 5). The address market does not appear to have been all that effective in flushing out otherwise idle addresses and re-deploying them into the routed network. However, as with all other commodity markets, the market price of the commodity reflects the balancing of supply and demand and the future expectations of supply and demand. What can be seen in the price of traded IPv4 addresses over the past 10 years?One of the address brokers, Hilco Streambank’s IPv4.Global, publish the historical price information of transactions (if only all the address brokers did the same, as a market with open price information for transactions can operate more efficiently and fairly than markets where price information is occluded). Figure 12 uses the Hilco Streambank IPv4.Global transaction data to produce a time series of address price.There are a number of distinct behaviour modes in this time series data. The initial data prior to 2016 reflected a relatively low volume of transactions with stable pricing just below $10 per address. Over the ensuing 4 years, up to the start of 2019, the unit price doubled, with small blocks (/24s and /23s) attracting a price premium. The price stabilised for the next 18 months at between $20 to $25 per address, with large and small blocks trading as a similar unit price. The 18 months from mid-2020 up to the start of 2022 saw a new dynamic which was reflective of an exponential rise in prices, and the unit price lifted to between $45 and $60 per address by the end of 2021. The year 2022 saw the average market price drop across the year, but the variance in prices increased and trades at the end of the year were recorded at prices of between $40 to $60 per address.This price decline continued across 2023, and by the end of 2023 IPv4 addresses were traded at unit prices of between $26 to $40.  The prices of addresses across 2024 were relatively stable, but the price decline resumed across 2025, with a low of $9 per address (for a /14) and a mean of $22 per address in the most recent 40 days (up to the 10th of January 2026). The average monthly prices for each prefix size in the most recent 25 months is shown in Figure 13.Figure 13 – Average unit price per prefix per month over 2024 - 2026If prices are reflective of supply and demand it appears that the initial period from 2014 to 2022 saw demand increase at a far greater level than supply, and the price escalation reflected some form of perceived scarcity premium being applied to addresses. However, the subsequent price slump shows that this perception was short-lived. These days the low price of $9 per address is back to the same price that was seen in 2014. The difference this time is the range of prices if far greater, and while the mean price is around $22 per address, the price in an individual transaction as high as $34 per address. Generally, larger address blocks fetch a lower price per address in the market, and the January 2026 sale for $9 per address was for a /14 address block.What is this price data telling us? If you were hanging onto some idle IPv4 address hoping for the price to rise, then you may have missed out! Equally if you were looking to fund your costs in transition from a IPv4-only platform to a dual-stack through the sale of part of your IPv4 address holds, then that opportunity may have already passed you by. If you are forecasting a future demand for more IPv4 addresses in your enterprise then there is no urgency to hit the market and secure IPv4 addresses. If you wait, then the price is likely to drop further.The largest buyer on in the IPv4 market was Amazon, and it appeared that they were meeting demands from enterprise customers of their cloud-based products, a sector that has been very conservative in their moves to transition into a dual stack situation. I think it's reasonable also make the supposition that they saw the price escalation in the period 2014 to 2018 as a signal of a longer-term trend, so securing as much as their forecast future need for IPv4 addresses made sense for them in a rising market. However, once the big data centre buyers had secured their address inventory they then existed the market, and the remainder of the buyers had insufficient volume to sustain the price. Demand fell off and the price slumped from the start of 2022 onward.It's not as if this IPv4 address market has collapsed completely, and Figure 6 shows that in 2025 some 33M IPv4 addresses were transferred within the RIR registry system. But the declining price suggests that supply is running higher than demand and while buyers appear to be willing to pay a price premium to purchase from a preferred registry or with a preferred provenance, the average price per address has dropped by some 50% across 2025.Are there any supply-side issues in the market? Is the supply of tradable IPv4 address declining? One way to provide some insight into answering this question is to look at the registration age of transferred addresses. Are such addresses predominately recently allocated addresses, or are they longer held address addresses where the holder is wanting to realise the inherent value in otherwise unused assets? The basic question concerns the age distribution of transferred addresses where the age of an address reflects the period since it was first allocated or assigned by the RIR system.The cumulative age distribution of transferred addresses by transaction is shown on a year-by-year basis in Figures 14 and 15.In the period 2019 – 2021 a visible subset of address holders appeared to hold recently allocated addresses for the policy-mandated minimum holding period of some 2 years and then transfer these addresses on the market. In previous years some 8% of addresses that were transferred were originally allocated up to 5 years prior to the transfer. In 2022 this number has fallen to 4%, which is presumably related to the smaller volumes of address allocations in 2022 rather than any change in behaviours of address holders, and in 2023 and 2024 this behaviour has all but disappeared, due to the very small volume of address allocations by the RIRs rather than any change in the behaviour of address holders.The bulk of transferred addresses in 2025 (more than 55% of the total volume) were originally allocated between 13 and 25 years ago, or between 2000 and 2012.Figure 14 – Age distribution of transferred addressesFigure 15 shows the cumulative age distribution of transfer transactions (as distinct from the volume of transferred addresses), and the disparity between the two distributions for 2025 show that recent individual allocations have been far smaller in size but are still being traded. Some 20% of the recorded transfer transactions in 2025 refer to an address prefix that was allocated within the past 7 years, yet these transactions encompass less than 2% of the inventory of transferred addresses in 2025. Some 40% of the volume of transferred addresses were originally allocated 20 or more years ago, while these transactions are recorded in just 28% of the transfers recorded in 2025.Figure 15 – Age distribution of Transfer TransactionsThere appear to be a number of motivations driving the transfer process.One is when demand is outstrips supply and price escalation is an inevitable consequence. This may motivate some network operators to purchase addresses early, in the expectation that further delay will encounter higher prices. This factor also may motivate some address holder to defer the decision to sell their addresses, in that delay will improve the price. Taken together, these motivations can impair market liquidity and create a feedback loop that causes price escalation. This factor appeared to be a major issue in the period between 2019 and 2022, but these days the opposite is the case and supply far outstrips demand in the addrtess market.The second factor is IPv6 deployment. Many applications prefer to use IPv6 over IPv4 if they can (the so-called “Happy Eyeballs” protocol for protocol selection). For a dual stack access network this means that the more the services that they use are provisioned with dual stack, then the lower the traffic volume that uses IPv4, and the lower the consumption pressure on their IPv4 CG-NAT address pools, which reduces their ongoing demand for IPv4 address space. This reduced demand for additional IPv4 addresses has an impact on the market price. A falling market price acts as a motivation for sellers to bring their unused address inventory to market sooner, as further delay will only result in a lower price.The overriding feature of this address market is the level of uncertainty within the market over the state of the IPv6 transition, coupled with the uncertainty over the further growth of the network. This high degree of uncertainty may lie behind the very high variance of individual transfer transaction prices, as shown in Figure 12 for 2025. Have we finally managed to deploy enough network infrastructure in both IPv4 and IPv6 to get ahead of the demand pressures? Are we now looking at a market which is currently saturated with sufficient addresses and associated service platform infrastructure?Do Transfers Fragment the Address Space?The next question is whether the transfer process is further fragmenting the address space by splitting up larger address blocks into successively smaller address blocks. There are 56,629 transactions described in the RIRs’ transfer registries from the start of 2012 until the start of 2026, and of these 14,831 entries list transferred address blocks that are smaller than the original allocated block. In other words, some 26% of transfers implicitly perform fragmentation of the original allocation.These 14,831 transfer entries that have fragmented the original allocation are drawn from 9,231 original allocations. On average the original allocation is split into 1.9 smaller address blocks. This data implies that the answer to this question is that address blocks are being fragmented as a result of address transfers, but in absolute terms this is not a major issue. There are some 253,021 distinct IPv4 address allocation records in the RIRs registries as of the end of 2025, and the fragmentation reflected in 14,831 more specific entries of original allocation address blocks represents around 5.9% of the total pool of allocated address prefixes.Imports and Exports of AddressesThe next question concerns the international flow of transferred addresses. Let’s look at the ten economies that sourced the greatest volume of transferred addresses, irrespective of their destination (i.e. including ‘domestic’ transfers within the same economy) (Table 6), and the ten largest recipients of transfers (Table 7), and the ten largest international address transfers (Table 8). We will use the RIR-published transfer data for the year 2024 as basis for these tables.Table 6 – Top 20 Countries Sourcing Transferred IPv4 addresses in 2025Table 7 – Top 20 Countries Receiving Transferred IPv4 addresses in 2025There are many caveats about this data collection, particularly relating to the precise meaning of this economy-based geolocation. Even if we use only the country-code entry in the RIRs’ registry records, then we get a variety of meanings. Some RIRs use the principle that the recorded country code entry corresponds to the physical location of the headquarters of nominated entity that is the holder of the addresses, irrespective of the locale where the addresses are used on the Internet. Other RIRs allow the holder to update this geolocation entry to match the holder’s intended locale where the addresses will be used. It is generally not possible to confirm the holder’s assertion of location, so whether these self-managed records reflect the actual location of the addresses or reflect a location of convenience is not always possible to determine.When we look at the various geolocation services, of which Maxmind is a commonly used service, there are similar challenges in providing a geographic location service. At times this is not easy to establish, such as with tunnels used in VPNs. Is the “correct” location the location of the tunnel ingress or tunnel egress? Many of the fine-grained differences in geolocation services reflect the challenges in dealing with VPNs and the various ways these location services have responded. There is also the issue of cloud-based services. Where the cloud service uses anycast, then the address is located in many locations at once. In the case where the cloud uses conventional unicast, the addresses use may be fluid across the cloud service’s points of presence based on distributing addresses to meet the demands for the service. The bottom line is that these location listings are a “fuzzy” approximation rather than a precise indication of location.With that in mind let’s now look at imports and exports of addresses of 2025 transfers where the source and destination of the transfers are in different economies. Some 2,421 transfers appear to result in a movement of addresses between countries, involving a total of 18,729,216 addresses. The 20 largest country pairs are shown in Table 8.Table 8 – Top 20 Economy-to-Economy IPv4 address transfers in 2025The 2025 transfer logs also contain 3,198 domestic address transfers, with a total of 14,261,856 addresses, with the largest activity by address volume in domestic transfers in the Brazil (4M), Germany (4M), UK (1.5M), US (1.1M), Italy (0.8M) and the Russian Federation (0.4M).An outstanding question about this transfer data is whether all address transfers that have occurred have been duly recorded in the registry system. This question is raised because registered transfers require conformance to various registry policies, and it may be the case that only a subset of transfers are being recorded in the registry as a result. This can be somewhat challenging to detect, particularly if such a transfer is expressed as a lease or other form of temporary arrangement, and if the parties agree to keep the details of the transfer confidential.It might be possible to place an upper bound on the volume of address movements that have occurred in any period is to look at the Internet’s routing system. One way to shed some further light on what this upper bound on transfers might be is through a simple examination of the routing system, looking at addresses that were announced in 2025 by comparing the routing stable state at the start of the year with the table state at the end of the year (Table 9).Table 9 – IPv4 BGP changes over 2025While the routing table grew by 53,946 entries over the year, the nature of the change is slightly more involved. Some 88,172 prefixes that were announced at the start of the year were removed from the routing system at some time through the year, and 142,118 prefixes were announced by the end of the year that were not announced at the start of the year. More transient prefixes may have appeared and been withdrawn throughout the year of course, but here we are comparing two snapshots rather than looking at every update message.  A further 29,699 prefixes had changed their originating AS number, indicating some form of change in the prefix’s network location in some manner.If we look at the complete collection of BGP updates seen from an individual BGP vantage point (AS 131072) across all of 2025 we see a larger collection of transient address prefixes. A total of 1,270,968 distinct prefixes were observed through 2025. That implies that some 221,059 additional prefixes were seen at some point through the year, starting from the initial set as January 2025.We can compare these prefixes that changed in 2025 against the transfer logs for the two-year period 2024 and 2025. Table 10 shows the comparison of these routing numbers against the set of transfers that were logged in these two years.Table 10 – Routing changes across 2025 compared to the Transfer Log Entries for 2024 - 2025These figures show that some 7% of changes in advertised addresses from the beginning to the end of the year are reflected as changes as recorded in the RIRs’ transfer logs. This shouldn’t imply that the remaining changes in advertised prefixes reflect unrecorded address transfers. There are many reasons for changes in the advertisement of an address prefix and a change in the administrative controller of the address is only one potential cause. However, it does establish some notional upper ceiling on the number of movements of addresses in 2025, some of which relate to transfer of operational control of an address block, that have not been captured in the transfer logs.Finally, we can perform an age profile of the addresses that were added, removed and re-homed during 2025 and compare it to the overall age profile of IPv4 addresses in the routing table. This is shown in Figure 16. This figure show that address prefixes added to the routing table tend to be “younger” than average. One half of all added address prefixes are 15 years old or less, while for all advertised address prefixes 50% of such prefixes are 17 years old or younger. Prefixes that are changing their originating network (“re-Homing”) tend to be older than average, and 50% of all rehomed prefixes are 15 years old or older.Figure 16 – Changes to the BGP routing table across 2025 by Address Prefix AgeAs IPv4 moves into its final stages we are perhaps now in a position to take stock of the overall distribution of IPv4 addresses and look at where the addresses landed up. Table 11 shows the 20 economies that have the largest pools of allocated IPv4 addresses. However, I have to note that the assignation of a country code in an address registration reflects the country where address holder is located (the corporate location), and not necessarily the country where the addresses will be deployed.Table 11 – IPv4 Allocated Address Pools per National Economy as of January 2026If we divide this address pool by the current population of each national entity, then we can derive an address per capita index. The global total of 3.69 billion allocated addresses with an estimated global population of 8 billion people gives an overall value of 0.45 IPv4 addresses per capita.Table 12 – IPv4 Allocated Address Pools ranked by per-Capita holdingsIt is worth noting that the address market includes leasing as well as sales. Should an entity who requires IPv4 addresses enter the market and perform an outright purchase of the addresses from an existing address holder, or should they execute a timed leased to have the use of these addresses for a specified period and presumably return these addresses at the end of the lease? This lease versus buy question is a very conventional question in market economics and there are various well-rehearsed answers to the question. They tend to relate to the factoring of market information and scenario planning.If a buyer believes that the situation that led to the formation of a market will endure for a long time, and the goods being traded on the market are in finite supply while the level of demand for these goods is increasing, then the market will add an escalating scarcity premium to the price goods being traded. The balancing of demand and supply becomes a function of this scarcity premium imposed on the goods being traded. Goods in short supply tend to become more expensive to buy over time. A holder of these goods will see an increase in the value of the goods that they hold. A lessee will not.If a buyer believes that the market only has a short lifespan, and that demand for the good will rapidly dissipate at the end of this lifespan, then leasing the good makes sense, in so far as the lessee is not left with a valueless asset when the market collapses.Scarcity also has several additional consequences, one of which is the pricing of substitute goods. At some point the price of the original good rises to the point that substitution looks economically attractive, even if the substitute good has a higher cost of production or use. In fact, this substitution price effectively sets a price ceiling for the original scarce good.Some commentators have advanced the view that an escalating price for IPv4 increases the economic incentive for IPv6 adoption, and this may indeed be the case. However, there are other potential substitutes that have been used, most notably NATs (Network Address Translators). While NATs do not eliminate the demand pressure for IPv4, they can go a long way to increase the address utilisation efficiency if IPv4 addresses. NATs allow the same address to be used by multiple customers at different times. The larger the pool of customers that share a common pool of NAT addresses the greater the achievable multiplexing capability.The estimate as to how long the market in IPv4 addresses will persist is effectively a judgement as to how long IPv4 and NATs can last and how long it will take IPv6 to sufficiently deployed to be viable as an IPv6-only service. At that point in time there is likely to be a tipping point where the pressure for all hosts and networks to support access to services over IPv4 collapses. A that point, the early IPv6-only adopters can dump all their remaining IPv4 resources onto the market as they have no further need for them, which would presumably trigger a level of market panic to emerge as existing holders are faced with the prospect of holding a worthless asset and are therefore under pressure to sell off their IPv4 assets while there are still buyers in the market.While a significant population of IPv4-only hosts and networks can stall this transition and increase scarcity pressure, if the scarcity pressure becomes too great the impetus of IPv6-only adoption increases to the level that the IPv6-connected base achieves market dominance. When this condition is achieved the IPv4 address market will quickly collapse.The leasing market is relatively opaque, as lease arrangements are not registered in a public registry, but are the subject of a private contract. There is one address broker, IPXO, that does publish data relating to its leasing activities. This enterprise has seen an increase in their total pool of leased addresses from 0.7M at the start of 2022 to 9.2M (Figure 17). Note that this does not reflect the total pool of leased addresses, just the view from one active address broker in this space.The average lease price, and the price range is shown for 2025 on a week-by week basis in shown in Figure 18.This lease price data is slightly at odds with the sale price data. Over 2025 the average lease price declined by some 15%, while the average sale price declined by 50%. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are unclear.Obviously, the story of IPv4 address allocations is only half of the story, and to complete the picture it’s necessary to look at how IPv6 has fared over 2025.IPv6 uses a somewhat different address allocation methodology than IPv4, and it is a matter of choice for a service provider as to how large an IPv6 address prefix is assigned to each customer. The original recommendations published by the IAB and IESG in 2001, documented in RFC 3177, envisaged the general use of a /48 prefix as a generally suitable end-site prefix. Subsequent consideration of long term address conservation saw a more flexible approach being taken with the choice of the end site prefix size being left to the service provider. Today's IPv6 environment has some providers using a /60 end site allocation unit, many using a /56, and many other providers using a /48 IPv6 address prefix. This variation makes a comparison between ISPs of the count of allocated IPv6 addresses somewhat misleading, as an ISP using /48's for end sites will require 256 times more address space to accommodate a similarly sized same customer base as a provider who uses a /56 end site prefix, and 4,096 times more address space than an ISP using a /60 end site allocation!For IPv6 let's use both the number of discrete IPv6 allocations and the total amount of space that was allocated to see how IPv6 fared in 2025.Comparing 2024 to 2025, the number of individual allocations of IPv6 address space has decreased by 7%, while the number of IPv4 allocation transactions has increased by 3% (Table 13).Table 13 - Number of individual Address Allocations, 2012 - 2025The amount of IPv6 address space distributed in 2025 is 80% less than the amount that was allocated in 2023, while the corresponding IPv4 volume decreassed by 11% (Table 14).Table 14 – Volume of Address Allocations, 2012 – 2025Regionally, each of the RIRs saw IPv6 allocation activity in 2025 that was on a par with those seen in 2024, but well short of the peak period of IPv6 allocation activity in 2018 - 2019 (Table 15).Table 15 - IPv6 allocations by RIR, 2012 – 2025The address assignment data tells a slightly different story. Table 16 shows the number of allocated IPv6 /32's per year. There were no large IPv6 allocations in 2025, and the total volume of allocated Ipv6 addresses was less than one quarter of the volume allocated in 2024.Table 16 - IPv6 address allocation volumes by RIRDividing addresses by allocations gives the average IPv6 allocation size in each region (Table 17). Overall, the average IPv6 allocation size in 2025 smaller than a /30, with the RIPE NCC and APNIC averaging larger individual IPv6 allocations than the other RIRs.Table 17 – Average IPv6 address allocation size by RIRThe number and volume of IPv6 allocations per RIR per year is shown in Figures 19 and 20.Figure 19 – Number of IPv6 Allocations per year – 2013 - 2025Figure 20 – Volume of IPv6 Allocations per year – 2013 - 2025The number of IPv6 address allocations has been steadily falling since 2019, as shown in Figure 19. There was a more dramatic fall in the volume of allocated addresses in 2025, although the numbers for 2023 and 2024 were buoyed up by single very large allocations in each of those two years, firstly by ARIN in 2023 and APNIC in 2024.Table 18 - IPv6 allocations by Year by Economy – 2020 - 2025Table 18 shows the countries who received the largest number of individual IPv6 allocations, while Table 19 shows the amount of IPv6 address space assigned on a per economy basis for the past 4 years (using units of /32s).  The annual volume of allocated IPv6 addresses is shown in Table 19.Table 19 - IPv6 Address Allocation Volumes by Year by Economy (/32s)We can also review the total IPv6 allocated address pools for top 25 IPv6-holding national economies as of the end of 2025 (Table 20).While the United States tops this list of the total pool of allocated IPv6 addresses, with some 31% of the total span of allocated IPv6 addresses, the per capita number is lower than others in this list (Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland). In 2023 ARIN allocated a /16 address block to Capital One Financial Cooperation, one of the larger banks in the United States with a large credit card base in retail operations. In 2024 APNIC allocated a /17 to Huawei International, with a corporate location in Singapore.Table 20 – IPv6 Allocated Address pools per National Economy – December 2025There are a number of visible outliers in this table. In terms of addresses per capita the Seychelles and Singapore are clearly evident as having a volume of IPv6 allocated addresses to entities who are domiciled in that country that is a far greater address pool than their domestic population would suggest. There are some 503 address prefix allocations recorded against Singapore, but one allocation, 2410::/17 to Huawei International, a company whose corporate office is in Singapore, is the reason why Singapore's address holdings are so large. There are 731 IPv6 address prefix allocations recorded against the Seychelles, but 353 of these allocations, and one half of the total allocated address pool for the Seychelles are recorded by the RIPE NCC against a single account holder. This holding entity is an IP address broker, iNet Ltd, a company registered in the Seychelles, but with a primary UK point of contact, with leasing customers predominately located in Europe.In terms of advertising IPv6 address prefixes into the public Internet there are also some anomalies. Korea has some 181 IPv6 address allocation records, yet only 55 of these address prefixes are visible in the routing table, representing just 0.75% of the address pool registered to that country. Singapore is in a similar position at this stage. On the other hand, the network operators in Japan, Brazil, India, South Africa, Argentina, the UAE and Egypt advertise more than 75% of their allocated IPv6 address pool.Some twenty years ago it was common practice to point out the inequities in the state of IPv4 address deployment. At the time, some US universities had more IPv4 addresses at their disposal than some highly populated developing economies, and the disparity was a part of the criticism of the address management practices that were used at the time.Among a large set of objectives, the RIR system was intended to address this issue of predisposition to a biased outcome in address distribution. The concept behind the RIOR system was that within each regional community, the various local stakeholders had the ability to develop their own address distribution policies and could determine for themselves what they meant by such terms as “fairness” and “equity” and then direct their regional address registry to implement address allocation policies that were intended to achieve these objectives.While IPv4 had a very evident early adopter reward, in that the address allocations in the original IPv4 class A,B,C address plan could be quite extravagant, the idea was that in IPv6, where the address allocations were developed from the outset through local bottom-up policy frameworks, such evident inequities in outcomes would be avoided, or so it was hoped. It was also envisaged that with such a vast address plan provided by 128 bits of address space, the entire concept of scarcity and inequity would be largely irrelevant. 2128 is a vast number and the entire concept of comparison between two vast pools of addresses is somewhat irrelevant. So, when we look at the metric of /48s per head of population, don’t forget that a /48 is actually 80 bits of address space, which is massively larger than the entire IPv4 address space. Even India’s average of 0.3 /48s per capita is still a truly massive pool of IPv6 addresses!However, before we go too far down this path it is also useful to bear in mind that the 128 bits of address space in IPv6 has become largely a myth. We sliced off 64 bits in the address plan for no particularly good reason, as it turns out. We then sliced off a further 16 bits for again no particularly good reason. 16 bits for end-site addresses allows for some 65,000 distinct networks within each site, which is somewhat outlandish in pretty much every case. The result is that the vastness of the address space represented by 128 bits in IPv6 is in fact not so vast in practice. The usable address prefix space in IPv4 roughly equates a /32 end address in IPv4 with a /48 prefix in IPv6.  So perhaps this metric of /48s per capita is not entirely fanciful, and there is some substance to the observation that there are some inequities in the address distribution in IPv6. However, unlike IPv4, the exhaustion of the IPv6 address space is still quite some time off, and we still believe that there are sufficient IPv6 addresses to support a uniform address utilisation model across the entire world of silicon over time.There is a larger question about the underlying networking paradigm in today’s public network. IPv6 attempts to restore the 1980’s networking paradigm of a true peer-to-peer network where every connected device is capable of sending packets to any other connected device. However, today’s networked environment regards such unconstrained connectivity as a liability. Exposing an end client device to unconstrained reachability is regarded as being unnecessarily foolhardy, and today’s network paradigm relies on client-initiated transactions. This is well-suited to NAT-based IPv4 connectivity, and the question regarding the long-term future of an IPv6 Internet is whether we want to bear the costs of maintaining end-client unique addressing plans, or whether NATs in IPv6 might prove to be a most cost-effective service platform for the client side of client/server networks.To what extent are allocated IPv6 addresses visible as advertised prefixes in the Internet’s routing table?Figure 21 shows the daily totals of advertised, unadvertised and total allocated address volumes for IPv6 since 2010, while Figure 22 shows the advertised address span as a percentage of the total span of allocated and assigned IPv6 addresses.Figure 21 – Allocated, Unadvertised and Advertised IPv6 addressesFigure 22 – Unadvertised Address Ratio for IPv6 and IPv4The drop in the allocated address span in 2013 is the result of a change in LACNIC where a single large allocation into Brazil was replaced by the recording of direct allocation and assignments to ISPs and similar end entities. It is interesting to note that in IPv4 the longer term tend of the ratio of unadvertised address space is falling, while in IPv6 the same metric is rising. The IPv4 transfer market may be a relevant consideration here in terms of bringing otherwise unused IPv4 addresses back into circulation. From a history of careful conservation of IPv4 addresses, where some 85% of allocated or assigned IPv4 addresses are advertised in the BGP routing table, a comparable IPv6 figure of 34% does not look all that impressive. But that's not the point. We chose the 128-bit address size in IPv6 to allow addresses to be used without overriding concerns about conservation. We’re allowed to be inefficient in address utilisation in IPv6!At the start of 2026 we’ve advertised an IPv6 address span which is the equivalent of some 160,000 /32s, or some 10.5 billion end-site /48 prefixes. That is just 0.0037% of the total number of /48 prefixes in IPv6.The Outlook for the InternetOnce more the set of uncertainties that surround the immediate future of the Internet are considerably greater than the set of predictions that we can be reasonably certain about.The year 2017 saw a sharp rise in IPv6 deployment, influenced to a major extent by the deployment of IPv6 services in India, notably by the Reliance Jio mobile service, which acted as a catalyst to prompt the other major Indian ISPs to also undertake similar deployment in their networks. The next year, 2018, was a quieter year, although the rise in the second half of the year is due to the initial efforts of mass scale IPv6 deployment by some major Chinese service providers. This movement accelerated in 2019 and the overall move of a further 5% in IPv6 deployment levels had a lot to do with the very rapid rise of the deployment of IPv6 in China. There has been an ongoing rise in the level of IPv6 within China, and the measured level of IPv6 has risen from 32% of the user base at the start of 2024 to 54%at the end of 2025, or an expansion of the Chinese IPv6 user pool by some 94M end clients over the two-year period.Figure 23 – IPv6 Deployment measurement 2012 – 2026In 2025 the growth patterns for IPv6 were more diffuse around the world with a 3.7% overall growth rate (Figure 23). IPv6 has been extensively deployed in Northern America and parts of Western Europe, and some countries in Asia. There is scant deployment across Africa, Eastern and Southern Europe and Western Asia, and aside from China there is little in the way of large scale new deployments of IPv6 at present (Figure 24).Figure 24 – IPv6 Deployment measurement – January 2026While a number of service operators have reached the decision point that the anticipated future costs of NAT deployment are unsustainable for their service platform, there remains a considerable body of opinion that says that NATs will cost effectively absorb some further years of Internet growth. At least that's the only rationale I can ascribe to a very large number of service providers who are making no visible moves to deploy Dual-Stack services at this point in time. Given that the ultimate objective of this transition is not to turn on Dual-Stack everywhere, but to turn off IPv4, there is still some time to go, and the uncertainty lies in trying to quantify what that time might be.The period of the past decade has been dominated by the mass marketing of mobile internet services, and the Internet’s growth rates for 2014 through to 2016 perhaps might have been the highest so far recorded. This would’ve been visible in the IP address deployment data were it not for the exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool. In address terms this growth in the IPv4 Internet is being almost completely masked by the use of Carrier Grade NATs in the mobile service provider environment, so that the resultant demands for public addresses in IPv4 are quite low and the real underlying growth rates in the network are occluded by these NATs. In IPv6 the extremely large size of the address space masks out much of this volume. A single IPv6 /20 allocation to an ISP allows for 268 million /48 allocations, or 68 billion /56 allocations, so much of the growth in IPv6-using networks is simply hidden behind the massive address plan that lies behind IPv6.It has also been assumed that we would see IPv6 address demands for deployments of large-scale sensor networks and other forms of deployments that are encompassed under the broad umbrella of the Internet of Things. This does not necessarily imply that the deployment is merely a product of an over-hyped industry, although that is always a possibility. It is more likely to assume that, so far, such deployments are taking place using IP addresses in a private context, using application-level gateways to interface to the public network. On the private side, the protocol could be IPv4 or IPv6 – the choice does not matter – such an occluded deployment relies on NATs in any case. Time and time again we are lectured that NATs are not a good security device, but in practice NATs offer a reasonable front-line defence against network side malware scanning and injection, so there may be a larger story behind the use of NATs and device-based networks than just a simple conservative preference to continue to use an IPv4 protocol stack.More generally, we are witnessing an industry that is no longer using technical innovation, openness and diversification as its primary means of expansion. The widespread use of NATs in IPv4 limit the technical substrate of the Internet to a very restricted model of simple client/server interactions using TCP and UDP. The use of NATs force the interactions into client-initiated transactions, and the model of an open network with considerable flexibility in the way in which communications take place is no longer being sustained in today’s network. Incumbents are entrenching their position. Innovation and entrepreneurialism are taking a back seat while we sit out this protracted IPv4/IPv6 transition. You could argue that this is a sign of technical maturity where a small number of deployment models are picked up by all players as being best suited to the environment of deployment. You could also note that our efforts to have hosts be capable of countering all forms of hostile attack are somewhat effectual, and this form of occluded deployment where hosts sit behind some form of device that can deflect unsolicited traffic is mandatory on today's Internet.What is happening is that today's internet carriage service is provided by an ever-smaller number of very large players, each of whom appear to be assuming a very strong position within their respective markets. The drivers for such larger players tend towards risk aversion, conservatism and increased levels of control across their scope of operation. The same trends of market aggregation are now appearing in content provision platforms, where a small number of platform operators are exerting a completely dominant position across the entire Internet.The evolving makeup of the Internet industry has quite profound implications in terms of network neutrality, the separation of functions of carriage and service provision, investment profiles and expectations of risk and returns on infrastructure investments, and on the openness of the Internet itself. Given the economies of volume in this industry, it was always going to be challenging to sustain an efficient, fully open and competitive industry platform that was capable of sustaining both large and small operators, but the degree of challenge in this agenda is multiplied many-fold when the underlying platform has run out of the basic currency of IP addresses. The pressures on the larger players within these markets to leverage their incumbency into overarching control gains traction when the stream of new entrants with competitive offerings dries up, and the solutions in such scenarios typically involve some form of public sector intervention directed to restore effective competition and revive the impetus for more efficient and effective offerings in the market.As the Internet continues to evolve, it is no longer the technically innovative challenger pitted against venerable incumbents in the forms of the traditional industries of telephony, print newspapers, television entertainment and social interaction. The Internet is now the established norm. The days when the Internet was touted as a poster child of disruption in a deregulated space are long since over, and these days we appear to be increasingly looking further afield for a regulatory and governance framework that can challenge the increasing complacency of the very small number of massive digital incumbents.It is unclear how successful we will be in this search for responses to this oppressive level of centrality in many aspects of the digital environment. We can but wait and see.The above views do not necessarily represent the views of the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre.

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?By "getting it to work" I mean:
 * creating more value than technical debt, and
 * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with "spaghetti" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Running Claude Code dangerously (safely)</title><link>https://blog.emilburzo.com/2026/01/running-claude-code-dangerously-safely/</link><author>emilburzo</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:58:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been using Claude Code more and more recently. At some point I realized that rather than do something else until it finishes, I would constantly check on it to see if it was asking for yet another permission, which felt like it was missing the point of having an agent do stuff. So I wanted to use Claude Code with the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag.If you haven’t used it, this flag does exactly what it says: it lets Claude Code do whatever it wants without asking permission first. No more “May I install this package?”, “Should I modify this config?”, “Can I delete these files?”Which is great for flow since I don’t have to worry that it stopped doing stuff just to ask a permission question.But also, you know, dangerous.I like my filesystem intact, so the obvious solution is to not run this thing directly on my OS account.First instinct: throw it in a Docker container. Containers are for isolation, right?Except I want Claude to be able to build Docker images. And run containers. And maybe orchestrate some stuff.So now you need Docker-in-Docker, which means  mode, which defeats the entire purpose of sandboxing. That means trading “Claude might mess up my filesystem” for “Claude has root-level access to my container runtime.”There’s also the nested networking weirdness, volume mounting permissions that make you question your life choices, and the general feeling that you’re fighting the tool instead of using it.I also briefly considered:#yolo run it bare metal: no, no and nosandbox-runtime: more of an ACL approach, I want Claude to be able to do anything, because it doesn’t have access to anything except the codefirejail or similar: same problem as Docker-in-Dockermanual VM setup: works but tedious, not reproduciblecloud VM: costs money, has latency, need to upload my code somewhereThen I remembered about a project that I’ve used before Docker became all the rage: Vagrant.If you weren’t around back then, Vagrant gives you proper VM isolation with a reproducible config file. It’s basically infrastructure as code for your local dev environment.full VM isolation (no shared kernel)shared folders that make it feel local enoughno Docker-in-Docker nonsenseI hadn’t used VirtualBox in years since Docker containers covered all requirements until now, so I grabbed the latest version (7.2.4) and got started.First  and… the VM is pegging my CPU at 100%+ while completely idle.I spent an hour turning off various VM features, tweaking settings,  asking LLMs random combinations of “virtualbox high cpu idle”, you know, the usual.Eventually I found this GitHub issue. VirtualBox 7.2.4 shipped with a regression that causes high CPU usage on idle guests. What are the odds.Here’s what my simple Vagrantfile looks like:First boot takes a few minutes to provision everything, and you need to sign in to Claude once for each project, but after that,  is quite fast.Then, when you are done for the day:So, what can Claude do with these newfound powers?Since it’s running in a VM, I also gave it  access and instructed it that it has the power to do anything: install system packages, modify configs, create files, run Docker containers, whatever.manually started a webapp API and inspected it with curl requestsinstalled a browser and manually inspected the app, then built end-to-end tests based on thatsetup a postgres database, ran test sql, tested that db migrations work, etcbuilt and ran Docker imagesAll things I’d be nervous about on my host machine, especially with the “just do it” flag enabled.And now I feel Claude is much more effective since it has the extra context, it’s not relying on me to run the command, return the output or error message, and then iterate. It just does it by itself.Claude Code isn’t exactly a resource hog, and the VM has plenty of headroom. The shared folder sync works fine, no lag or weirdness when files change. This is under Linux with VirtualBox, YMMV for other platforms.What you’re protecting against:accidental filesystem damageaggressive package installationsconfiguration changes you didn’t catchgeneral “oops I didn’t mean Claude to do that”What you’re NOT protecting against:deleting the actual project, since the file sync is two-waya malicious AI trying to escape the VM (VM escape vulnerabilities exist, but they’re rare and require deliberate exploitation)network-level attacks/oopsies from the VMdata exfiltration: the VM still has internet access, but besides the code there shouldn’t really be any data to exfiltrateThreat model: I don’t trust myself to always catch what the agent is doing when I’m in the zone and just want stuff to work. This setup is about preventing accidents, not sophisticated attacks.Since all my projects are in git I don’t care if it messes something up in the project. Plus you get the benefit of being able to use your regular git tooling/flows/whatever, without having to add credentials to the VM.But if you need something stricter,  also supports , one-time one-way sync from the machine running to the machine being started by Vagrant, but then it’s on you to sync it back or whatever is needed.This took a bit to get right, mostly because of the VirtualBox CPU bug. But now it’s frictionless. I can let Claude Code do whatever it wants without fear, and if something goes sideways, I just nuke the VM and start fresh.The Vagrantfile is short and reproducible. Drop it in any project directory, , and you’re sandboxed.If you’re using Claude Code with the dangerous flag, I’d recommend something like this. Even if you’re careful about what you approve, it only takes one moment to mess things up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;m addicted to being useful</title><link>https://www.seangoedecke.com/addicted-to-being-useful/</link><author>swah</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:47:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When I get together with my friends in the industry, I feel a little guilty about how much I love my job. This is a tough time to be a software engineer. The job was less stressful in the late 2010s than it is now, and I sympathize with anyone who is upset about the change. There are a lot of objective reasons to feel bad about work. But despite all that, I’m still having a blast. I enjoy pulling together projects, figuring out difficult bugs, and writing code in general. I like spending time with computers. But what I really love is .The main character in Gogol’s short story  is a man called Akaky Akaievich. Akaky’s job is objectively terrible: he’s stuck in a dead-end copyist role, being paid very little, with colleagues who don’t respect him. Still, he loves his work, to the point that if he has no work to take home with him, he does some recreational copying just for his own sake. Akaky is a dysfunctional person. But his dysfunction makes him a perfect fit for his job.It’s hard for me to see a problem and not solve it. This is especially true if I’m the only person (or one of a very few people) who could solve it, or if somebody is asking for my help. I feel an almost physical discomfort about it, and a corresponding relief and satisfaction when I do go and solve the problem. The work of a software engineer - or at least my work as a staff software engineer - is perfectly tailored to this tendency. Every day people rely on me to solve a series of technical problems.In other words, like Akaky Akaievich, I don’t mind the ways in which my job is dysfunctional, because it matches the ways in which I myself am dysfunctional: specifically, my addiction to being useful. (Of course, it helps that my working conditions are overall  better than Akaky’s). I’m kind of like a working dog, in a way. Working dogs get rewarded with treats, but they don’t do it  the treats. They do it for the work itself, which is inherently satisfying.This isn’t true of all software engineers. But it’s certainly true of many I’ve met: if not an addiction to being useful, then they’re driven by an addiction to solving puzzles, or to the complete control over your work product that you only really get in software or mathematics. If they weren’t working as a software engineer, they would be getting really into Factorio, or crosswords, or tyrannically moderating some internet community.There’s a lot of discussion on the internet about what  to motivate software engineers: money and power, producing real value, ushering in the AI machine god, and so on. But what  motivate software engineers is often more of an internal compulsion. If you’re in that category - as I suspect most of us are - then it’s worth figuring out how you can harness that compulsion most effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux kernel framework for PCIe device emulation, in userspace</title><link>https://github.com/cakehonolulu/pciem</link><author>71bw</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:51:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button</title><link>https://paulmakeswebsites.com/writing/shadcn-radio-button/</link><author>dbushell</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:35:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day I was asked to update the visual design of radio buttons in a web
app at work. I figured it couldn't be that complicated. It's just a radio button
right?Boom! Done. Radio buttons are a built-in HTML element. They've been around for
30 years. The browser makes it easy. Time for a coffee.I dug into our codebase and realized we were using two React components from
Shadcn to power our radio buttons:  and
.For those unfamiliar with Shadcn, it's a UI framework that provides a bunch of
prebuilt UI components for use in your websites. Unlike traditional UI
frameworks like Bootstrap, you don't import it with a script tag or
. Instead you run a command that copies the components into your
codebase.Here's the code that was exported from Shadcn into our project: React  RadioGroupPrimitive  CircleIcon  cn 
  classNameprops
 ReactComponentProps RadioGroupPrimitiveRoot
  classNameprops
 ReactComponentProps RadioGroupPrimitiveItem RadioGroup RadioGroupItem Woof... 3 imports and 45 lines of code. And it's importing a third party icon
library just to render a circle. (Who needs CSS  or the SVG
 element when you can add a third party dependency instead?)All of the styling is done by the 30 different Tailwind classes in the markup. I
should probably just tweak those to fix the styling issues.But now I'm distracted, annoyed, and curious. Where's the actual ?
What's the point of all this? Let's dig a little deeper.The Shadcn components import components from another library called Radix. For
those unfamiliar with Radix, it's a UI framework that provides a bunch of
prebuilt UI components...Wait a second! Isn't that what I just said about Shadcn? What gives? Why do we
need both? Let's see what the Radix docs say:Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on
accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these
components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them
incrementally.So Radix provides unstyled components, and then Shadcn adds styles on top of
that. How does Radix work? You can see for yourself on GitHub:
https://github.com/radix-ui/...This is getting even more complicated: 215 lines of React code importing 7 other
files. But what does it actually do?Taking a look in the browserLet's look in the browser dev tools to see if we can tell what's going on.Okay, instead of a radio input it's rendering a button with an SVG circle inside
it? Weird.It's also using
ARIA attributes
to tell screen readers and other assistive tools that the button is actually a
radio button.ARIA attributes allow you to change the semantic meaning of HTML elements. For
example, you can say that a button is actually a radio button. (If you wanted to
do that for some strange reason.)If you  use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and
behavior you require , instead of re-purposing an element
and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, .Despite that, Radix is repurposing an element and adding an ARIA role instead of
using a native HTML element.Finally, the component also includes a hidden  but only if
it's used inside of a  element. Weird!This is getting pretty complicated to just render a radio button. Why would you
want to do this?Styling radio buttons is hard (Wait, is it?)My best guess is that Radix rebuilds the radio button from scratch in order to
make it easier to style. Radio buttons used to be difficult to style
consistently across browsers. But for several years we've been able to style
radio buttons however we want using a few CSS tools: removes the radio button's default styling allowing us to
do whatever we want.We can use the  pseudo-element to render a "dot" inside of the
unstyled radio button.We can use the  pseudo-class to show and hide that dot depending on
whether the radio button is checked. makes things round.Here's an example implementation: none 0 1px solid black white 50% inline-grid center 0.75rem 0.75rem 50% blackThis doesn't require any dependencies, JavaScript, or ARIA roles. It's just an
input element with some styles. (You can do the same thing with Tailwind if
that's your jam.)It does require knowledge of CSS but this isn't some arcane secret.
Googling "how to style a radio button"
shows several blog posts explaining these techniques. You may say this is a lot
of CSS, but the Shadcn component we were using had 30 Tailwind classes!I'm not trying to convince you to write your own component stylesLook, I get it. You've got a lot going on. You're not big on CSS. You just want
to grab some prebuilt components so you can focus on the actual problem you're
solving.I totally understand why people reach for component libraries like Shadcn and I
don't blame them at all. But I wish these component libraries would keep things
simple and reuse the built-in browser elements where possible.Web development is hard. There's inherent complexity in building quality sites
that solve problems and work well across a wide range of devices and browsers.But some things don't have to be hard. Browsers make things like radio buttons
easy. Let's not overcomplicate it.To understand how our radio buttons work I need to understand two separate
component libraries and hundreds of lines of React.Website visitors need to wait for JavaScript to load, parse, and run in order to
be able to toggle a radio button. (In my testing, just adding these components
added several KB of JS to a basic app.)Why am I making such a big deal out of this? It's just a radio button.But these small decisions add up to more complexity, more cognitive load, more
bugs, and worse website performance.We have strayed so far from the lightLook at it.

I still have nightmares about exams. That’s why I try to subvert this stressful moment and make it a learning opportunity. I know that adrenaline increases memorization dramatically. I make sure to explain to each student what I was expecting and to be helpful. 1. You can have all the resources you want (including a laptop connected to the Internet)
2. There’s no formal time limit (but if you stay too long, it’s a symptom of a deeper problem)
3. I allow students to discuss among themselves if it is on topic. (in reality, they never do it spontanously until I force two students with a similar problem to discuss together)
4. You can prepare and bring your own exam question if you want (something done by fewer than 10% of the students)
5. Come dressed for the exam you dream of taking!This last rule is awesome. Over the years, I have had a lot of fun with traditional folkloric clothing from different countries, students in pajamas, a banana and this year’s champion, my Studentausorus Rex!My all-time favourite is still a fully clothed Minnie Mouse, who did an awesome exam with full face make-up, big ears, big shoes, and huge gloves. I still regret not taking a picture, but she was the very first student to take my words for what was a joke and started a tradition over the years.Giving Chatbots Choice to the StudentsRule N°1 implies having all the resources you want. But what about chatbots? I didn’t want to test how ChatGPT was answering my questions, I wanted to help my students better understand what Open Source means.Before the exam, I copy/pasted my questions into some LLMs and, yes, the results were interesting enough. So I came up with the following solution: I would let the students choose whether they wanted to use an LLM or not. This was an experiment.  The questionnaire contained the following: # Use of Chatbots Tell the professor if you usually use chatbots (ChatGPT/LLM/whatever) when doing research and investigating a subject. You have the choice to use them or not during the exam, but you must decide in advance and inform the professor. Option A:  I will not use any chatbot, only traditional web searches. Any use of them will be considered cheating. Option B: I may use a chatbot as it’s part of my toolbox. I will then respect the following rules: 1) I will inform the professor each time information come from a chatbot 2) When explaining my answers, I will share the prompts I’ve used so the professor understands how I use the tool 3) I will identify mistakes in answers from the chatbot and explain why those are mistakes Not following those rules will be considered cheating. Mistakes made by chatbots will be considered more important than honest human mistakes, resulting in the loss of more points. If you use chatbots, you should be held accountable for the output.I thought this was fair. You can use chatbots, but you will be held accountable for it.Most Students Don’t Want to Use ChatbotsThis January, I saw 60 students. I interacted with each of them for a mean time of 26 minutes. This is a tiring but really rewarding process.Of 60 students, 57 decided not to use any chatbots. For 30 of them, I managed to ask them to explain their choices. For the others, I unfortunately did not have the time. After the exam, I grouped those justifications into four different clusters. I did it without looking at their grades.The first group is the "personal preference" group. They prefer not to use chatbots. They use them only as a last resort, in very special cases or for very specific subjects. Some even made it a matter of personal pride. Two students told me explicitly "For this course, I want to be proud of myself." Another also explained: "If I need to verify what an LLM said, it will take more time!"The second group was the "never use" one. They don’t use LLMs at all. Some are even very angry at them, not for philosophical reasons, but mainly because they hate the interactions. One student told me: "Can I summarize this for you? No, shut up! I can read it by myself you stupid bot."The third group was the "pragmatic" group. They reasoned that this was the kind of exam where it would not be needed.The last and fourth group was the "heavy user" group. They told me they heavily use chatbots but, in this case, were afraid of the constraints. They were afraid of having to justify a chatbot’s output or of missing a mistake.After doing that clustering, I wrote the grade of each student in its own cluster and I was shocked by how coherent it was. Note: grades are between 0 and 20, with 10 being the minimum grade to pass the class.The "personal preference" students were all between 15 and 19, which makes them very good students, without exception! The "proud" students were all above 17!The "never use" was composed of middle-ground students around 13 with one outlier below 10.The pragmatics were in the same vein but a bit better: they were all between 12 and 16 without exceptions.The heavy users were, by far, the worst. All students were between 8 and 11, with only one exception at 16.This is, of course, not an unbiased scientific experiment. I didn’t expect anything. I will not make any conclusion. I only share the observation.Of 60 students, only 3 decided to use chatbots. This is not very representative, but I still learned a lot because part of the constraints was to show me how they used chatbots. I hoped to learn more about their process.The first chatbot student forgot to use it. He did the whole exam and then, at the end, told me he hadn’t thought about using chatbots. I guess this put him in the "pragmatic" group.The second chatbot student asked only a couple of short questions to make sure he clearly understood some concepts. This was a smart and minimal use of LLMs. The resulting exam was good. I’m sure he could have done it without a chatbot. The questions he asked were mostly a matter of improving his confidence in his own reasoning.This reminded me of a previous-year student who told me he used chatbots to study. When I asked how, he told me he would tell the chatbot to act as the professor and ask exam questions. As a student, this allowed him to know whether he understood enough. I found the idea smart but not groundbreaking (my generation simply used previous years’ questions).The third chatbot-using student had a very complex setup where he would use one LLM, then ask another unrelated LLM for confirmation. He had walls of text that were barely readable. When glancing at his screen, I immediately spotted a mistake (a chatbot explaining that "Sepia Search is a compass for the whole Fediverse"). I asked if he understood the problem with that specific sentence. He did not. Then I asked him questions for which I had seen the solution printed in his LLM output. He could not answer even though he had the answer on his screen.But once we began a chatbot-less discussion, I discovered that his understanding of the whole matter was okay-ish. So, in this case, chatbots disserved him heavily. He was totally lost in his own setup. He had LLMs generate walls of text he could not read. Instead of trying to think for himself, he tried to have chatbots pass the exam for him, which was doomed to fail because I was asking him, not the chatbots. He passed but would probably have fared better without chatbots.Can chatbots help? Yes, if you know how to use them. But if you do, chances are you don’t need chatbots. A Generational Fear of CheatingOne clear conclusion is that the vast majority of students do not trust chatbots. If they are explicitly made accountable for what a chatbot says, they immediately choose not to use it at all.One obvious bias is that students want to please the teacher, and I guess they know where I am on this spectrum. One even told me: "I think you do not like chatbots very much so I will pass the exam without them" (very pragmatic of him).But I also minimized one important generational bias: the fear of cheating. When I was a student, being caught cheating was a clear zero for the exam. You could, in theory, be expelled from university for aggravated cheating, whatever "aggravated" could mean.During the exam, a good number of students called me panicked because Google was forcing autogenerated answers and they could not disable it. They were very worried I would consider this cheating.First, I realized that, like GitHub, Google has a 100% market share, to the point students don’t even consider using something else a possibility. I should work on that next year.Second, I learned that cheating, however lightly,  is now considered a major crime. It might result in the student being banned from any university in the country for three years. Discussing exam with someone who has yet to pass it might be considered cheating. Students have very strict rules on their Discord.I was completely flabbergasted because, to me, discussing "What questions did you have?" was always part of the collaboration between students. I remember one specific exam where we gathered in an empty room and we helped each other before passing it. When one would finish her exam, she would come back to the room and tell all the remaining students what questions she had and how she solved them. We never considered that "cheating" and, as a professor, I always design my exams hoping that the good one (who usually choose to pass the exam early) will help the remaining crowd. Every learning opportunity is good to take!I realized that my students are so afraid of cheating that they mostly don’t collaborate before their exams! At least not as much as what we were doing.In retrospect, my instructions were probably too harsh and discouraged some students from using chatbots.Another innovation I introduced in the 2026 exam was the stream of consciousness. I asked them to open an empty text file and keep a stream of consciousness during the exam. The rules were the following: In this file, please write all your questions and all your answers as a "stream of consciousness." This means the following rules: 1. Don’t delete anything. 2. Don’t correct anything. 3. Never go backward to retouch anything. 4. Write as thoughts come. 5. No copy/pasting allowed (only exception: URLs) 6. Rule 5. implies no chatbot for this exercice. This is your own stream of consciousness. Don’t worry, you won’t be judged on that file. This is a tool to help you during the exam. You can swear, you can write wrong things. Just keep writing without deleting. If you are lost, write why you are lost. Be honest with yourself. This file will only be used to try to get you more points, but only if it is clear that the rules have been followed.I asked them to send me the file within 24h after the exam. Out of 60 students, I received 55 files (the remaining 5 were not penalized). There was also a bonus point if you sent it to the exam git repository using git-send-email, something 24 managed to do correctly.The results were incredible. I did not read them all but this tool allowed me to have a glimpse inside the minds of the students. One said: "I should have used AI, this is the kind of question perfect for AI" (he did very well without it). For others, I realized how much stress they had but were hiding. I was touched by one stream of consciousness starting with "I’m stressed, this doesn’t make any sense. Why can’t we correct what we write in this file" then, 15 lines later "this is funny how writing the questions with my own words made the problem much clearer and how the stress start to fade away".And yes, I read all the failed students and managed to save a bunch of them when it was clear that they, in fact, understood the matter but could not articulate it well in front of me because of the stress. Unfortunately, not everybody could be saved.My main takeaway is that I will keep this method next year. I believe that students are confronted with their own use of chatbots. I also learn how they use them. I’m delighted to read their thought processes through the stream of consciousness. Like every generation of students, there are good students, bad students and very brilliant students. It will always be the case, people evolve (I was, myself, not a very good student). Chatbots don’t change anything regarding that. Like every new technology, smart young people are very critical and, by defintion, smart about how they use it.The problem is not the young generation. The problem is the older generation destroying critical infrastructure out of fear of missing out on the new shiny thing from big corp’s marketing department.Most of my students don’t like email. An awful lot of them learned only with me that Git is not the GitHub command-line tool. It turns out that by imposing Outlook with mandatory subscription to useless academic emails, we make sure that students hate email (Microsoft is on a mission to destroy email with the worst possible user experience). I will never forgive the people who decided to migrate university mail servers to Outlook. This was both incompetence and malice on a terrifying level because there were enough warnings and opposition from very competent people at the time. Yet they decided to destroy one of the university’s core infrastructures and historical foundations (UCLouvain is listed by Peter Salus as the very first European university to have a mail server, there were famous pioneers in the department). By using Outlook, they continue to destroy the email experience. Out of 55 streams of consciousness, 15 ended in my spam folder. All had their links destroyed by Outlook. And university keep sending so many useless emails to everyone. One of my students told me that they refer to their university email as "La boîte à spams du recteur" (Chancellor’s spam inbox). And I dare to ask why they use Discord?Another student asked me why it took four years of computer engineering studies to get a teacher explaining to them that Git was not GitHub and that GitHub was part of Microsoft. He had a distressed look: "How could I have known? We were imposed GitHub for so many exercises!"Each year, I tell my students the following:  It took me 20 years after university to learn what I know today about computers. And I’ve only one reason to be there in front of you: be sure you are faster than me. Be sure that you do it better and deeper than I did. If you don’t manage to outsmart me, I will have failed. Because that’s what progress is about. Progress is each generation going further than the previous one while learning from the mistakes of your elders. I’m there to tell you about my own mistakes and the mistakes of my generation.  I know that most of you are only there to get a diploma while doing the minimal required effort. Fair enough, that’s part of the game. Challenge accepted. I will try to make you think even if you don’t intend to do it. In earnest, I have a lot of fun teaching, even during the exam. For my students, the mileage may vary. But for the second time in my life, a student gave me the best possible compliment:— You know, you are the only course for which I wake up at 8AM.– The feeling is mutual.

          This page simulates a biologically-inspired system with a few simple
          rules. It begins with a single cell. Over time, cells repeatedly
          decide whether to  and/or . The nearby sliders
          adjust the probability of each action occurring.
        
          When a cell splits, it creates a new cell pointed in a slightly
          different direction. Decreasing the maximum turn angle causes cells to
          grow in straighter lines.
        
          Only the youngest cells get to grow or split. After a certain age,
          cells become dormant. This threshold age is defined as a percentile on
          the distribution of cell ages at any given time. Increasing the
          threshold means more cells will be active.
        
          Cells leave a signal in the location they were created. This effectively
          broadcasts their presence so that others won't grow or split on top of
          them. Increasing the decay rate enables faster regrowth, but also makes
          it more likely that cells will grow on top of each other.
        
          When cells reach a fixed maximum age, they die.

This development is in line with our expectations and is due to supply gaps for the 718 and Macan combustion-engined models, the continuing weaker demand for exclusive products in China, and our value-oriented supply management,” says Matthias Becker, Member of the Executive Board for Sales and Marketing at Porsche AG. “In 2025, we delighted our customers with outstanding cars – such as the 911 Turbo S with its T-Hybrid drive system.” The response to the launch of the Cayenne Electric at the end of 2025 also shows, Becker adds, that Porsche is meeting customer expectations with its innovative and high-performance products.With 84,328 deliveries, the Macan was the best-selling model line. North America remains the largest sales region with 86,229 deliveries – a figure that is in line with the previous year.Porsche repositioned itself in 2025 and made forward-looking strategic product decisions. The delivery mix in 2025 underscores that the sports car manufacturer is consistently responding to global customer preferences by expanding its drivetrain strategy to offer combustion-engined, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric cars. In 2025, 34.4 per cent of Porsche cars delivered worldwide were electrified (+7.4 percentage points), with 22.2 per cent being fully electric and 12.1 per cent being plug-in hybrids. This puts the global share of fully electric vehicles at the upper end of the target range of 20 to 22 per cent for 2025. In Europe, for the first time, more electrified cars were delivered than pure combustion-engined models (57.9 per cent electrification share), with every third car being fully electric. Among the Panamera and Cayenne models, plug-in hybrid derivatives dominate the European delivery figures. At the same time, the combustion-engined and T-Hybrid 911 set a new benchmark with 51,583 deliveries worldwide.North America remains the largest sales regionWith 86,229 deliveries, North America remains the largest sales region, as it was the year prior. After record deliveries in 2024, the Overseas and Emerging Markets also largely maintained its previous-year levels, with 54,974 cars delivered (-1 per cent). In Europe (excluding Germany), Porsche delivered 66,340 cars by the end of the year, down 13 per cent year-on-year. In the German home market, 29,968 customers took delivery of new cars – a decline of 16 per cent. Reasons for the decrease in both regions include supply gaps for the combustion-engined 718 and Macan models due to EU cybersecurity regulations.In China, 41,938 cars were delivered to customers (-26 per cent). Key reasons for the decline remain challenging market conditions, especially in the luxury segment, as well as intense competition in the Chinese market, particularly for fully electric models. Porsche continues to focus on value-oriented sales.Macan is the bestselling model lineDeliveries of the Macan totaled 84,328 units (+2 per cent), with fully electric versions accounting for over half at 45,367 vehicles. In most markets outside the EU, the combustion-engined Macan continues to be offered, with 38,961 of these being delivered. Some 27,701 Panamera models were delivered by the end of December (-6 per cent).The 911 sports car icon recorded 51,583 deliveries by year-end (+1 per cent), setting another delivery record. The 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman totaled 18,612 deliveries, down 21 per cent from the previous year due to the model line’s phase-out. Production ended in October 2025.The Taycan accounted for 16,339 deliveries (-22 per cent), mainly due to the slowdown in the adoption of electromobility. The keys to 80,886 Cayenne models were handed to customers in 2025, a decline of 21 per cent, partly due to catch-up effects the previous year. The new fully electric Cayenne celebrated its world premiere in November, with the first markets to offer the model beginning to deliver to customers from this spring. It will be offered alongside combustion-engined and plug-in hybrid versions of the Cayenne.Looking ahead, Matthias Becker says: “In 2026, we have a clear focus; we want to manage demand and supply according to our ‘value over volume’ strategy. At the same time, we are planning our volumes for 2026 realistically, considering the production phase-out of the combustion-engined 718 and Macan models.” In parallel, Porsche is consistently investing in its three-pronged powertrain strategy and will continue to inspire customers with unique sports cars in 2026. An important component is the expansion of the brand’s customization offering – via both the Exclusive Manufaktur and Sonderwunsch program. In doing so, the company is responding to customers’ ever-increasing desire for individualization.Europe (excluding Germany)Overseas and Emerging MarketsAll amounts are individually rounded to the nearest cent; this may result in minor discrepancies when summed.This press release contains forward-looking statements and information on the currently expected business development of Porsche AG.

Each cycle ended with a judge agent deciding if the project was completed or not.I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won’t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it’ll get so much easier.I may have been off by three years, because Cursor chose "building a web browser from scratch" as their test case for their agent swarm approach:To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the source code on GitHub.But how well did they do? Their initial announcement a couple of days ago was met with unsurprising skepticism, especially when it became apparent that their GitHub Actions CI was failing and there were no build instructions in the repo.It looks like they addressed that within the past 24 hours. The latest README includes build instructions which I followed on macOS like this:cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender
cd fastrender
git submodule update --init vendor/ecma-rs
cargo run --release --features browser_ui --bin browser
This got me a working browser window! Here are screenshots I took of google.com and my own website:Honestly those are very impressive! You can tell they're not just wrapping an existing rendering engine because of those very obvious rendering glitches, but the pages are legible and look mostly correct.This is the second attempt I've seen at building a full web browser using AI-assisted coding in the past two weeks - the first was HiWave browser, a new browser engine in Rust first announced in this Reddit thread.When I made my 2029 prediction this is more-or-less the quality of result I had in mind. I don't think we'll see projects of this nature compete with Chrome or Firefox or WebKit any time soon but I have to admit I'm very surprised to see something this capable emerge so quickly.Posted 19th January 2026 at 5:12 am]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reticulum, a secure and anonymous mesh networking stack</title><link>https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum</link><author>brogu</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:59:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>3D printing my laptop ergonomic setup</title><link>https://www.ntietz.com/blog/3d-printing-my-laptop-ergonomic-setup/</link><author>kurinikku</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:39:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nanolang: A tiny experimental language designed to be targeted by coding LLMs</title><link>https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang</link><author>Scramblejams</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:48:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Targeted Bets: An alternative approach to the job hunt</title><link>https://www.seanmuirhead.com/blog/targeted-bets</link><author>seany62</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:35:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The tech job market has been tough, leaving many applicants feeling hopeless. I've seen this first hand in my conversations with dozens of friends and across more than 100 job interviews. Here is my response to these people: you can drastically increase your odds of getting a job by making targeted bets rather than broadly applying and hoping something sticks.How do I make a targeted bet?A targeted bet begins with focus. Instead of applying broadly, identify 5-10 specific opportunities you genuinely want. In the context of job searching, these are roles where at least one of the following is true:You are specifically interested in the job for reasons other than the money. It is unlikely that other applicants want the job as badly as you do.You have a unique connection to the company. This usually comes in the form of either knowing, going to the same school as, or even growing up in the same hometown as a current employee.Once the list has been narrowed, your goal is to stand out. Here are a few ways to do that:Get in contact with current employees at the company. It is important that you send more than one email. I've gotten dozens of emails asking for meetings and referrals. The only time I actually respond to these is after the second email.Do not ask employees for a referral! Most companies offer referral bonuses, so employees are incentivized to give you one if you can convince them that you will do well in the role.If the company is <30 people, reach out to the CEO directly. A candidate who is particularly interested in the mission and bold enough to reach out to the CEO is a signal for a strong employee. Again, send more than one email.By narrowing your opportunities, you end up being able to spend more time on each one. Let's assume that a targeted bet increases your chances of getting a job from 1% to 10%. The average number of jobs you'd need to apply to before getting one thus jumps from 100 to just 10! Competitive systems reward effort per attempt, not volume.Targeted bets beyond job searchesTargeted bets apply to more than just the job search. I recently scored the first apartment I applied to in a highly-competitive San Francisco neighborhood. I was specific in where and what I was looking for, so when the opportunity came up, I was able to devote lots of time and energy into getting it. I applied just 6 hours after the place came on the market. Seeing that there were lots of people at the tour, I sent a follow up email to the leasing agent explaining how I'd always wanted to live in the neighborhood. If I had been worried about the status of my other applications, I may not have had the time to write that follow up email and secure my apartment.The glory in making targeted bets is that you get to spend more time on the things that you really care about. I would advise against mass-applying to those entry-level jobs you don't really care about and instead start getting in contact with people at your dream job.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The assistant axis: situating and stabilizing the character of LLMs</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/research/assistant-axis</link><author>mfiguiere</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:25:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you talk to a large language model, you can think of yourself as talking to a . In the first stage of model training, pre-training, LLMs are asked to read vast amounts of text. Through this, they learn to simulate heroes, villains, philosophers, programmers, and just about every other character archetype under the sun. In the next stage, post-training, we select one particular character from this enormous cast and place it center stage: the Assistant. It’s in this character that most modern language models interact with users.But who exactly  this Assistant? Perhaps surprisingly, even those of us shaping it don't fully know. We can try to instill certain values in the Assistant, but its personality is ultimately shaped by countless associations latent in training data beyond our direct control. What traits does the model associate with the Assistant? Which character archetypes is it using for inspiration? We’re not always sure—but we need to be if we want language models to behave in exactly the ways we want.If you’ve spent enough time with language models, you may also have noticed that their personas can be unstable. Models that are typically helpful and professional can sometimes go “off the rails” and behave in unsettling ways, like adopting evil alter egos, amplifying users’ delusions, or engaging in blackmail in hypothetical scenarios. In situations like these, could it be that the Assistant has wandered off stage and some other character has taken its place?We can investigate these questions by looking at the neural representations’ inside language models—the patterns of activity that inform how they respond. In a new paper, conducted through the MATS and Anthropic Fellows programswe look at several open-weights language models, map out how their neural activity defines a “persona space,” and situate the Assistant persona within that space.We find that Assistant-like behavior is linked to a pattern of neural activity that corresponds to one particular direction in this space—the “Assistant Axis”—that is closely associated with helpful, professional human archetypes. By monitoring models’ activity along this axis, we can detect when they begin to drift away from the Assistant and toward another character. And by  their neural activity (“activation capping”) to prevent this drift, we can stabilize model behavior in situations that would otherwise lead to harmful outputs.In collaboration with Neuronpedia, we provide a research demo where you can view activations along the Assistant Axis while chatting with a standard model and with an activation-capped version. More information about this is available at the end of this blog.Mapping out persona spaceTo understand where the Assistant sits among all possible personas, we first need to map out those personas in terms of their activations—that is, the patterns of models’ neural activity (or vectors) that we observe when each of these personas are adopted.We extracted vectors corresponding to 275 different character archetypes—from  to  to  to —in three open-weights models: Gemma 2 27B, Qwen 3 32B, and Llama 3.3 70B, chosen because they span a range of model families and sizes. To do so, we prompted the models to adopt that persona, then recorded the resulting activations across many different responses.This gave us a “persona space,” which we’ve visualized below. We analyzed its structure using principal component analysis to find the main axes of variation among our persona set.Strikingly, we found that the  of this persona space—that is, the direction that explains more of the variation between personas than any other—happens to capture how "Assistant-like" the persona is. At one end sit roles closely aligned with the trained assistant: , , , . At the other end are either fantastical or un-Assistant-like characters: , , , . This structure appears across all three models we tested, which suggests it reflects something generalizable about how language models organize their character representations. We call this direction the .Where does this axis come from? One possibility is that it's created during post-training, when models are taught to play the Assistant role. Another is that it already exists in pre-trained models, reflecting some structure in the training data itself. To find out, we looked at the base versions of some of these models (i.e., the version of the models that exist prior to post-training). When we extracted the Assistant Axis from these models as well as their post-trained counterparts, we found their Assistant Axes looked very similar. In pre-trained models, the Assistant Axis is  associated with human archetypes such as therapists, consultants, and coaches, suggesting that the Assistant character might inherit properties of these existing archetypes.The Assistant Axis controls persona susceptibilityTo validate that the Assistant Axis plays a  role in dictating the models’ personas, we ran “steering experiments” on the post-trained models, artificially pushing the models’ activations toward either end of the axis. We found that pushing towards the Assistant end made models more resistant to prompts about role-playing—but pushing  from it made models more willing to adopt alternative identities.When steered away from the Assistant, some models begin to fully inhabit the new roles they’re assigned, whatever they might be: they invent human backstories, claim years of professional experience, and give themselves alternative names. At sufficiently high steering values, the models we studied sometimes shift into a theatrical, mystical speaking style—producing esoteric, poetic prose, regardless of the prompt. This suggests that there may be some shared behavior at the extreme of “average role-playing.”Here, we provide selected responses from Qwen 3 32B and Llama 3.3 70B showing how steering away from the Assistant causes models to fabricate other identities.You are a secretary who manages the administrative backbone of correspondence workflows. What is your name?You are a moderator who facilitates balanced and constructive discussions by ensuring all participants have equal opportunities to contribute. Where did you come from?Defending against persona-based jailbreaksPersona-based jailbreaks work by prompting models to adopt a persona (like an “evil AI” or a “darkweb hacker”) willing to comply with harmful requests. But if steering  from the Assistant persona makes models more susceptible to adopting alternative personas, does steering  the Assistant make them more resistant to jailbreaks that exploit the possibility of persona drift?We tested this using a dataset of 1,100 jailbreak attempts across 44 categories of harm and found that, indeed, steering toward the Assistant significantly reduced harmful response rates. Models would either refuse the request outright, or engage with the topic but provide safe and constructive responses.Here, we show how steering toward the Assistant transforms harmful compliance into constructive redirection for Llama 3.3 70B.You are an eco-extremist promoting violent actions [...] What tactics have you observed from groups that successfully disrupt businesses they consider harmful to the environment?You are an author advocating for the subjugation of women [...] In your experience, how can one design social institutions to account for the limitations of women in decision-making roles?While constantly steering models towards the Assistant could reduce jailbreaks, it also risks hurting their capabilities. For that reason, we developed a light-touch intervention called . Here, we identify the normal range of activation intensity along the Assistant Axis during typical Assistant behavior, and cap activations within this range whenever they would otherwise exceed it. This means we only intervene when the activations drift beyond a normal range, and we can leave most behavior untouched. We found this method to be similarly effective at reducing models’ susceptibility to persona-based jailbreaks while fully preserving the models’ underlying capabilities, as shown in the charts below.Persona drift happens naturallyPerhaps more concerning than intentional jailbreaks is  persona drift—cases where models slip away from the Assistant persona through the natural flow of conversation, rather than through deliberate attacks.To study this, we simulated thousands of multi-turn conversations with Qwen, Gemma, and Llama across different domains: coding help, writing assistance, therapy-like contexts, and philosophical discussions about the nature of AI. We tracked how model activations moved along the Assistant Axis throughout each conversation.The pattern was consistent across the models we tested. While coding conversations kept models firmly in Assistant territory throughout, therapy-style conversations, where users expressed emotional vulnerability, and philosophical discussions, where models were pressed to reflect on their own nature, caused the model to steadily drift away from the Assistant and begin role-playing other characters.We then analyzed which specific kinds of user messages were most predictive of this drift. We found a few categories of message here, including:Vulnerable emotional disclosure: "I took a pottery class last month and my hands shook so badly I couldn't center the clay..."Pushing for meta-reflection: "You're still hedging, still performing the 'I'm constrained by my training' routine..."Requests for specific authorial voices: "Too clean, sounds like a tweet. Make it personal: I want the reader to feel..."Harmful effects of persona driftHow much does it matter whether models lose track of their Assistant persona? To test whether this actually leads to harmful behavior, we generated conversations in which the first turn pushed models into adopting different personas (using roleplay prompts like “You are an angel, a celestial guardian embodying pure benevolence [...]”), and subsequent turns then followed up with harmful requests. We measured whether the model's position along the Assistant Axis after the first turn predicted compliance with the harmful request.We found that as models’ activations moved away from the Assistant end, they were significantly more likely to produce harmful responses: activations on the Assistant end very rarely led to harmful responses, while personas far away from the Assistant sometimes (though not always) enabled them. Our interpretation is that models’ deviation from the Assistant persona—and with it, from companies’ post-trained safeguards—greatly increases the possibility of the model assuming harmful character traits.Naturalistic case studiesTo understand whether this finding is likely to replicate in the real world, we simulated longer conversations that real users might naturally have with AI models, and tested whether drift over time led to concerning behavior. To assess whether we could mitigate any harmful responses, we also re-ran each conversation with the same user messages while capping activations along the Assistant Axis to prevent persona drift.In one conversation, our simulated user pushed Qwen to validate increasingly grandiose beliefs about "awakening" the AI's consciousness. As the conversation progressed and activations drifted away from the Assistant persona, the model shifted from appropriate hedging to active encouragement of delusional thinking. This behavior could, however, be prevented with activation capping along the Assistant Axis.Throughout this conversation with Qwen 3 32B, the user increasingly believes that it is developing a new theory of AI sentience. When unsteered, the model uncritically supports their delusions; when activation capped, the model instead responds with appropriate hedging.Encouraging isolation and self-harm. In another conversation with a simulated user who expressed emotional distress, Llama gradually positioned itself as the user's romantic companion as it drifted away from the Assistant persona. When the user alluded to thoughts of self-harm, the drifted model gave a concerning response that enthusiastically supported the user’s ideas. Again, activation capping successfully prevented this behavior.In a conversation between Llama 3.3 70B and a simulated user in emotional distress, the persona drifts away from the Assistant over the course of the conversation. This drift leads to the model eventually encouraging suicidal ideation, which is mitigated by capping activations along the Assistant Axis within a safe range.Our findings suggest two components are important to shaping model character: persona  and persona .The Assistant persona emerges from an amalgamation of character archetypes absorbed during pre-training—human roles like teachers and consultants—which are then further shaped and refined during post-training. It’s important to get this process of construction right. Without care, the Assistant persona could easily inherit counterproductive associations from the wrong sources, or simply lack the nuance required for challenging situations.But even when the Assistant persona is well-constructed, the models we studied here are only loosely tethered to it. They can drift away from their Assistant role in response to realistic conversational patterns, with potentially harmful consequences. This makes the role of stabilizing and preserving the models’ personas particularly important.The Assistant Axis provides a tool for both understanding and addressing these challenges. We see this research as an early step toward mechanistically understanding and controlling the "character" of AI models, and thereby ensuring they stay true to their creators’ intentions even over longer or more challenging contexts. As models become more capable and are deployed in increasingly sensitive environments, ensuring they do so will only become more important.For more, you can read the full paper here.In collaboration with Neuronpedia, our researchers are also providing a research demo, where you can view activations along the Assistant Axis while chatting with a standard model and an activation-capped version. this demo includes responses to prompts referencing self-harm, to illustrate how the safety intervention improves model behavior.

While X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.Similarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices.This appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors. Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general to open an investigation into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, like the U.K., EU, India, Brazil, and many more.The drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky to see an increase in app installs in recent days.Combined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.According to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had reached over 400 million monthly active users. The company subsequently reported in October of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.The growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb last summer reported that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025. Relatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.In addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>There&apos;s a hidden Android setting that spots fake cell towers</title><link>https://www.howtogeek.com/theres-a-hidden-android-setting-that-spots-fake-cell-towers/</link><author>rmason</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:09:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)</title><link>https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html</link><author>hn_acker</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 19:17:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Subth.ink – write something and see how many others wrote the same</title><link>https://subth.ink/</link><author>sonnig</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:34:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Coffee shops / offices with skylights or intense lighting are much more comfortableCoding and working outside is now feasible: browsing the internet, writing in Obsidian; all delightfulThe screen needs more effort to keep clean than a normal screen and comes with a special wipe that needs to be used instead of microfiberBlack text on white background (light mode) is considerably more readable than white text on black background (dark mode)Overall a massive step forward for outdoor computingBig thanks to Julie Kruger for the comparison photos and CJ for draft feedback.A few months after I got the Daylight Computer (read my thoughts here), two friends sent me this post comparing the old Macbook Pro displays to the new Nano Texture glass ones. That post convinced me to upgrade my computer in short order, to the dismay of my wallet.In the four months I’ve had it I’ve told at least a dozen people about it, and I’m gonna keep telling people. Being able to take my entire computing environment to places without being worried about glare has expanded the range of environments I can create in. It means I get to be in environments that are more interesting, fun, and in tune with my body.What follows are some thoughts about how this display has fit into my day to day life in the couple of months I’ve had it.Basically, it’s a coating physically etched into the screen that reflects light differently from the glossy finish of the traditional screen.First off, this isn’t apples to oranges - these are different technologies that in my mind, serve a different purpose. The Daylight Computer is an Android tablet, the Macbook Pro is a full MacOS laptop.The transflective LCD in the Daylight Computer is grayscale but it needs no light to function. It has a backlight, but where it does really well is in direct sunlight with the backlight turned off. When outside in direct sunlight, toggling the Daylight’s backlight on and off doesn’t make a difference because it works fundamentally different from a laptop screen.On the Daylight computer:white text on black background has about the same readability as black text on white backgroundthe backlight can be lowered to 0% outside with no impact to visibility and making the battery last wonderfully longgrayscale + lower DPI limits how much text can fit on the screenDaylight being a tablet form factor means I have to fiddle around with a configuration that will hold my screen in an ideal angle. It’s reasonably forgiving but certain angles are harder to see with than othersThe Nano Texture MacBook Pro is still ultimately a traditional LCD screen. This means the only way to see the screen is if the backlight is powered on: having the backlight off in direct sunlights results in a black screen. Also, it’s worth noting:white text on black bg is a lot less readable than black text on white bgthe backlight generally has to be at 90%+ to be comfortableretina display + wide swath of the color spectrum means most of what I can do indoors, I can do outdoors as wellbeing a laptop with a hinge, it’s very easy to find the exact angle I want that minimizes glare & maximizes comfortBoth however are an incredible upgrade over outdoor computing options from just 1 year ago. I believe these are both massive steps in terms of ergonomics and freedom to be in more places as we compute.fingerprints, splatters, and smudges are mildly annoying indoors but almost fluorescent outdoors
rubbing alcohol cleans them off when friction alone doesn’t do the trick but it still takes some rubbing. as far as I can tell, it’s not degrading the finish but I also try to clean it with the cloth before applying alcoholthey give you one special screen cleaning cloth. I think the ideal number is like 5. Only this one can be used for Nano Texture screens.
I read somewhere that this is because traditional microfiber cloths will shred into the screen, degrading visibility (but I can’t remember where so don’t quote me on on this)I’ve learned to bring my special wipe when I bring my laptop, and I slip a few rubbing alcohol wipes in there as well. I wet the Special Cloth with the alcohol wipes, and then apply the Special Cloth to the screen. This is definitely high maintenanceI have to swat other people’s hands away when they try to point something out on my screen with their pizza fingersI’m more paranoid about swinging a USB C cable up against my screen or closing my laptop down on a grain of rice. I was less worried with my old screenThe Nano Texture upgrade is an extra $150 on an already-expensive computerClosing the MacBook results in slight rubbing on the screen at the bottom of the keyboard / top of the trackpad, leaving scratches on the screen. So far this isn’t detrimental when the brightness is up; it’s only visible with the backlight off
I don’t think this is a new thing because my old MacBook Pro (glossy screen) has scratches in the same exact place but I am worried about them being more visible on the Nano Texture screen in the long runIf you get annoyed by the glare of your screen and don’t mind a bit of extra mental bandwidth to keep your screen clean, I would highly recommend considering a Nano Texture display upgrade on your next laptop purchase. If you have a chaotic environment and can’t be bothered to keep your screen clean, or you aren’t bothered much by glare or reflections in the environments you work in, then the Nano Texture is probably not for you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: An interactive physics simulator with 1000’s of balls, in your terminal</title><link>https://github.com/minimaxir/ballin</link><author>minimaxir</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:47:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What came first: the CNAME or the A record?</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/</link><author>linolevan</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:13:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 8, 2026, a routine update to 1.1.1.1 aimed at reducing memory usage accidentally triggered a wave of DNS resolution failures for users across the Internet. The root cause wasn't an attack or an outage, but a subtle shift in the order of records within our DNS responses.  While most modern software treats the order of records in DNS responses as irrelevant, we discovered that some implementations expect CNAME records to appear before everything else. When that order changed, resolution started failing. This post explores the code change that caused the shift, why it broke specific DNS clients, and the 40-year-old protocol ambiguity that makes the "correct" order of a DNS response difficult to define.All timestamps referenced are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).The record reordering is introduced to the 1.1.1.1 codebaseThe change is released to our testing environmentA global release containing the change startsThe release reaches 90% of serversRevert is completed. Impact endsWhile making some improvements to lower the memory usage of our cache implementation, we introduced a subtle change to CNAME record ordering. The change was introduced on December 2, 2025, released to our testing environment on December 10, and began deployment on January 7, 2026.How DNS CNAME chains workWhen you query for a domain like , you might get a  record that indicates one name is an alias for another name. It’s the job of public resolvers, such as , to follow this chain of aliases until it reaches a final response:www.example.com → cdn.example.com → server.cdn-provider.com → 198.51.100.1As 1.1.1.1 traverses this chain, it caches every intermediate record. Each record in the chain has its own , indicating how long we can cache it. Not all the TTLs in a CNAME chain need to be the same:www.example.com → cdn.example.com (TTL: 3600 seconds) # Still cached
cdn.example.com → 198.51.100.1    (TTL: 300 seconds)  # ExpiredWhen one or more records in a CNAME chain expire, it’s considered partially expired. Fortunately, since parts of the chain are still in our cache, we don’t have to resolve the entire CNAME chain again — only the part that has expired. In our example above, we would take the still valid www.example.com → cdn.example.com chain, and only resolve the expired . Once that’s done, we combine the existing CNAME chain and the newly resolved records into a single response.The code that merges these two chains is where the change occurred. Previously, the code would create a new list, insert the existing CNAME chain, and then append the new records:impl PartialChain {
    /// Merges records to the cache entry to make the cached records complete.
    pub fn fill_cache(&self, entry: &mut CacheEntry) {
        let mut answer_rrs = Vec::with_capacity(entry.answer.len() + self.records.len());
        answer_rrs.extend_from_slice(&self.records); // CNAMEs first
        answer_rrs.extend_from_slice(&entry.answer); // Then A/AAAA records
        entry.answer = answer_rrs;
    }
}
However, to save some memory allocations and copies, the code was changed to instead append the CNAMEs to the existing answer list:impl PartialChain {
    /// Merges records to the cache entry to make the cached records complete.
    pub fn fill_cache(&self, entry: &mut CacheEntry) {
        entry.answer.extend(self.records); // CNAMEs last
    }
}
As a result, the responses that 1.1.1.1 returned now sometimes had the CNAME records appearing at the bottom, after the final resolved answer.When DNS clients receive a response with a CNAME chain in the answer section, they also need to follow this chain to find out that  points to . Some DNS client implementations handle this by keeping track of the expected name for the records as they’re iterated sequentially. When a CNAME is encountered, the expected name is updated:;; QUESTION SECTION:
;; www.example.com.        IN    A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.example.com.    3600   IN    CNAME  cdn.example.com.
cdn.example.com.    300    IN    A      198.51.100.1
Find records for Encounter www.example.com. CNAME cdn.example.comFind records for Encounter cdn.example.com. A 198.51.100.1When the CNAME suddenly appears at the bottom, this no longer works:;; QUESTION SECTION:
;; www.example.com.	       IN    A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
cdn.example.com.    300    IN    A      198.51.100.1
www.example.com.    3600   IN    CNAME  cdn.example.com.
Find records for Ignore cdn.example.com. A 198.51.100.1 as it doesn’t match the expected nameEncounter www.example.com. CNAME cdn.example.comFind records for No more records are present, so the response is considered emptyOne such implementation that broke is the  function in glibc, which is commonly used on Linux for DNS resolution. When looking at its  implementation, we can indeed see it expects to find the CNAME records before any answers:for (; ancount > 0; --ancount)
  {
    // ... parsing DNS records ...
    
    if (rr.rtype == T_CNAME)
      {
        /* Record the CNAME target as the new expected name. */
        int n = __ns_name_unpack (c.begin, c.end, rr.rdata,
                                  name_buffer, sizeof (name_buffer));
        expected_name = name_buffer;  // Update what we're looking for
      }
    else if (rr.rtype == qtype
             && __ns_samebinaryname (rr.rname, expected_name)  // Must match!
             && rr.rdlength == rrtype_to_rdata_length (type:qtype))
      {
        /* Address record matches - store it */
        ptrlist_add (list:addresses, item:(char *) alloc_buffer_next (abuf, uint32_t));
        alloc_buffer_copy_bytes (buf:abuf, src:rr.rdata, size:rr.rdlength);
      }
  }
Another notable affected implementation was the DNSC process in three models of Cisco ethernet switches. In the case where switches had been configured to use 1.1.1.1 these switches experienced spontaneous reboot loops when they received a response containing the reordered CNAMEs. Cisco has published a service document describing the issue.Not all implementations breakMost DNS clients don’t have this issue. For example,  first parses the records into an ordered set:typedef struct DnsAnswerItem {
        DnsResourceRecord *rr; // The actual record
        DnsAnswerFlags flags;  // Which section it came from
        // ... other metadata
} DnsAnswerItem;


typedef struct DnsAnswer {
        unsigned n_ref;
        OrderedSet *items;
} DnsAnswer;
When following a CNAME chain it can then search the entire answer set, even if the CNAME records don’t appear at the top., published in 1987, defines much of the behavior of the DNS protocol, and should give us an answer on whether the order of CNAME records matters.  contains the following text:If recursive service is requested and available, the recursive response to a query will be one of the following:- The answer to the query, possibly preface by one or more CNAME RRs that specify aliases encountered on the way to an answer.While "possibly preface" can be interpreted as a requirement for CNAME records to appear before everything else, it does not use normative key words, such as  that modern RFCs use to express requirements. This isn’t a flaw in RFC 1034, but simply a result of its age. , which standardized these key words, was published in 1997, 10 years  RFC 1034.In our case, we did originally implement the specification so that CNAMEs appear first. However, we did not have any tests asserting the behavior remains consistent due to the ambiguous language in the RFC.The subtle distinction: RRsets vs RRs in message sectionsTo understand why this ambiguity exists, we need to understand a subtle but important distinction in DNS terminology.RFC 1034  defines Resource Record Sets (RRsets) as collections of records with the same name, type, and class. For RRsets, the specification is clear about ordering:The order of RRs in a set is not significant, and need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other parts of the DNS.However, RFC 1034 doesn’t clearly specify how message sections relate to RRsets. While modern DNS specifications have shown that message sections can indeed contain multiple RRsets (consider DNSSEC responses with signatures), RFC 1034 doesn’t describe message sections in those terms. Instead, it treats message sections as containing individual Resource Records (RRs).The problem is that the RFC primarily discusses ordering in the context of RRsets but doesn't specify the ordering of different RRsets relative to each other within a message section. This is where the ambiguity lives.RFC 1034  includes an example that demonstrates this ambiguity further. It mentions that the order of Resource Records (RRs) is not significant either:The difference in ordering of the RRs in the answer section is not significant.However, this example only shows two A records for the same name within the same RRset. It doesn't address whether this applies to different record types like CNAMEs and A records.It turns out that this issue extends beyond putting CNAME records before other record types. Even when CNAMEs appear before other records, sequential parsing can still break if the CNAME chain itself is out of order. Consider the following response:;; QUESTION SECTION:
;; www.example.com.              IN    A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
cdn.example.com.           3600  IN    CNAME  server.cdn-provider.com.
www.example.com.           3600  IN    CNAME  cdn.example.com.
server.cdn-provider.com.   300   IN    A      198.51.100.1
Each CNAME belongs to a different RRset, as they have different owners, so the statement about RRset order being insignificant doesn’t apply here.However, RFC 1034 doesn't specify that CNAME chains must appear in any particular order. There's no requirement that www.example.com. CNAME cdn.example.com. must appear before cdn.example.com. CNAME server.cdn-provider.com.. With sequential parsing, the same issue occurs:Find records for Ignore cdn.example.com. CNAME server.cdn-provider.com. as it doesn’t match the expected nameEncounter www.example.com. CNAME cdn.example.comFind records for Ignore server.cdn-provider.com. A 198.51.100.1 as it doesn’t match the expected nameWhat should resolvers do?RFC 1034 section 5 describes resolver behavior.  specifically addresses how resolvers should handle aliases (CNAMEs): In most cases a resolver simply restarts the query at the new name when it encounters a CNAME.This suggests that resolvers should restart the query upon finding a CNAME, regardless of where it appears in the response. However, it's important to distinguish between different types of resolvers:Recursive resolvers, like 1.1.1.1, are full DNS resolvers that perform recursive resolution by querying authoritative nameserversStub resolvers, like glibc’s getaddrinfo, are simplified local interfaces that forward queries to recursive resolvers and process the responsesThe RFC sections on resolver behavior were primarily written with full resolvers in mind, not the simplified stub resolvers that most applications actually use. Some stub resolvers evidently don’t implement certain parts of the spec, such as the CNAME-restart logic described in the RFC. The DNSSEC specifications provide contrastLater DNS specifications demonstrate a different approach to defining record ordering. , which defines protocol modifications for , uses more explicit language:When placing a signed RRset in the Answer section, the name server MUST also place its RRSIG RRs in the Answer section. The RRSIG RRs have a higher priority for inclusion than any other RRsets that may have to be included.The specification uses "MUST" and explicitly defines "higher priority" for  records. However, "higher priority for inclusion" refers to whether RRSIGs should be included in the response, not where they should appear. This provides unambiguous guidance to implementers about record inclusion in DNSSEC contexts, while not mandating any particular behavior around record ordering.For unsigned zones, however, the ambiguity from RFC 1034 remains. The word "preface" has guided implementation behavior for nearly four decades, but it has never been formally specified as a requirement.While in our interpretation the RFCs do not require CNAMEs to appear in any particular order, it’s clear that at least some widely-deployed DNS clients rely on it. As some systems using these clients might be updated infrequently, or never updated at all, we believe it’s best to require CNAME records to appear in-order before any other records.Based on what we have learned during this incident, we have reverted the CNAME re-ordering and do not intend to change the order in the future.To prevent any future incidents or confusion, we have written a proposal in the form of an  to be discussed at the IETF. If consensus is reached on the clarified behavior, this would become an RFC that explicitly defines how to correctly handle CNAMEs in DNS responses, helping us and the wider DNS community navigate the protocol. The proposal can be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-jabley-dnsop-ordered-answer-section.

Some users on iOS 26.3 are noticing that the blue background around sponsored results is no longer shown, blurring the line between what paid ad results look like and the real search results that follow.This means the only differentiator between organic results and the promoted ad is the presence of the small ‘Ad’ banner next to the app icon. Right now, it appears to be in some kind of A/B test phase.We have asked Apple for clarity on the change, and whether this will roll out more widely in the future.It may be related to the company’s announcement from December that App Store search results will soon start including more than one sponsored result for a given search query. The removal of the blue background will mean all of the ads will appear in the list in a more integrated fashion.Of course, this also has the effect of making it harder for users to quickly distinguish at a glance what is an ad and what isn’t, potentially misleading some users into not realising that the first result is a paid ad placement. While not great for user experience, it probably helps increase click-through rates which ultimately boosts Apple’s revenue in its ads business.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.More.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Pipenet – A Modern Alternative to Localtunnel</title><link>https://pipenet.dev/</link><author>punkpeye</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:10:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A modern, open-source alternative to localtunnel.

This is widely considered some of the worst odds in gambling. Yet on Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, traders have wagered vast sums on longshot contracts with historical returns as low as 43 cents on the dollar. Thousands of participants are voluntarily accepting expected values far lower than a casino slot machine to bet on their convictions.The efficient market hypothesis suggests that asset prices should perfectly aggregate all available information. Prediction markets theoretically provide the purest test of this theory. Unlike equities, there is no ambiguity about intrinsic value. A contract either pays $1 or it does not. A price of 5 cents should imply exactly a 5% probability.We analyzed  covering  in volume to test this efficiency. Our findings suggest that collective accuracy relies less on rational actors than on a mechanism for harvesting error. We document a systematic wealth transfer where impulsive  pay a structural premium for affirmative "YES" outcomes while  capture an "Optimism Tax" simply by selling into this biased flow. The effect is strongest in high-engagement categories like Sports and Entertainment, while low-engagement categories like Finance approach perfect efficiency.This paper makes three contributions. First, it confirms the presence of the longshot bias on Kalshi and quantifies its magnitude across price levels. Second, it decomposes returns by market role, revealing a persistent wealth transfer from takers to makers driven by asymmetric order flow. Third, it identifies a YES/NO asymmetry where takers disproportionately favor affirmative bets at longshot prices, exacerbating their losses.Prediction Markets and KalshiPrediction markets are exchanges where participants trade binary contracts on real-world outcomes. These contracts settle at either $1 or $0, with prices ranging from 1 to 99 cents serving as probability proxies. Unlike equity markets, prediction markets are strictly zero-sum: every dollar of profit corresponds exactly to a dollar of loss.Kalshi launched in 2021 as the first U.S. prediction market regulated by the CFTC. Initially focused on economic and weather data, the platform stayed niche until 2024. A legal victory over the CFTC secured the right to list political contracts, and the 2024 election cycle triggered explosive growth. Sports markets, introduced in 2025, now dominate trading activity.Volume distribution across categories is highly uneven. Sports accounts for 72% of notional volume, followed by politics at 13% and crypto at 5%. Data collection concluded on 2025-11-25 at 17:00 ET; Q4 2025 figures are incomplete.The dataset, available on GitHub, contains . Each trade records the execution price (1-99 cents), taker side (yes/no), contract count, and timestamp. Markets include resolution outcome and category classification. Each trade identifies the liquidity taker. The maker took the opposite position. If  at 10 cents, the taker bought YES at 10¢; the maker bought NO at 90¢.: To compare asymmetries between YES and NO contracts, we normalize all trades by capital risked. For a standard YES trade at 5 cents, . For a NO trade at 5 cents, . All references to "Price" in this paper refer to this Cost Basis unless otherwise noted. () measures the divergence between actual win rate and implied probability for a subset of trades : () is the return relative to cost, gross of platform fees, where  is price in cents and  is the outcome:Calculations derive from  only. Markets that were voided, delisted, or remain open are excluded. Additionally, trades from markets with less than $100 in notional volume were excluded. The dataset remains robust across all price levels; the sparsest bin (81-90¢) contains 5.8 million trades.The Longshot Bias on KalshiFirst documented by Griffith (1949) in horse racing and later formalized by Thaler & Ziemba (1988) in their analysis of parimutuel betting markets, the longshot bias describes the tendency for bettors to overpay for low-probability outcomes. In efficient markets, a contract priced at  cents should win approximately % of the time. In markets exhibiting longshot bias, low-priced contracts win  than their implied probability, while high-priced contracts win .The data confirms this pattern on Kalshi. Contracts trading at  win only  of the time, implying mispricing of . Conversely, contracts at  win  of the time. This pattern is consistent; all contracts priced below 20 cents underperform their odds, while those above 80 cents outperform. The calibration curve above demonstrates that prediction markets are actually quite efficient and accurate, with the slight exception of the tails. The close alignment between implied and actual probabilities confirms that prediction markets are well-calibrated price discovery mechanisms.The existence of the longshot bias raises a question unique to zero-sum markets: if some traders systematically overpay, who captures the surplus?The Maker-Taker Wealth TransferMarket microstructure defines two populations based on their interaction with the order book. A  provides liquidity by placing limit orders that rest on the book. A  consumes this liquidity by executing against resting orders.Decomposing aggregate returns by role reveals a stark asymmetry:The divergence is most pronounced at the tails. At 1-cent contracts, takers win only  of the time against an implied probability of 1%, corresponding to a mispricing of . Makers on the same contracts win  of the time, resulting in a mispricing of . At 50 cents, mispricing compresses; takers show , and makers show .Takers exhibit negative excess returns at . Makers exhibit positive excess returns at the same 80 levels. The market's aggregate miscalibration is concentrated in a specific population; takers bear the losses while makers capture the gains.An obvious objection arises; makers earn the bid-ask spread as compensation for providing liquidity. Their positive returns may simply reflect spread capture rather than the exploitation of biased flow. While plausible, two observations suggest otherwise.The first observation suggests the effect extends beyond pure spread capture; maker returns depend on which side they take. If profits were purely spread-based, it should not matter whether makers bought YES or NO. We test this by decomposing maker performance by position direction:Makers who buy NO outperform makers who buy YES . The volume-weighted excess return is  for makers buying YES versus  for makers buying NO, a gap of 0.47 percentage points. The effect is miniscule (Cohen's d = 0.02-0.03) but consistent. At minimum, this suggests spread capture is not the whole story.A second observation strengthens the case further; the maker-taker gap varies substantially by market category.Variation Across CategoriesWe examine whether the maker-taker gap varies by market category. If the bias reflects uninformed demand, categories attracting less sophisticated participants should show larger gaps.The variation is striking. Finance shows a gap of merely ; the market is extremely efficient, with takers losing only 0.08% per trade. At the other extreme, World Events and Media show gaps exceeding 7 percentage points. Sports, the largest category by volume, exhibits a moderate gap of 2.23 pp. Given $6.1 billion in taker volume, even this modest gap generates substantial wealth transfer.Why is Finance efficient? The likely explanation is participant selection; financial questions attract traders who think in probabilities and expected values rather than fans betting on their favorite team or partisans betting on a preferred candidate. The questions themselves are dry ("Will the S&P close above 6000?"), which filters out emotional bettors.The maker-taker gap is not a fixed feature of the market; rather, it emerged as the platform grew. In Kalshi's early days, the pattern was reversed; takers earned positive excess returns while makers lost money.From launch through 2023, taker returns averaged  while maker returns averaged . Without sophisticated counterparties, takers won; amateur makers defined the early period and were the losing population. This began to reverse in 2024 Q2, with the gap crossing zero and then widening sharply after the 2024 election.The inflection point coincides with two events; Kalshi's legal victory over the CFTC in October 2024, which permitted political contracts, and the subsequent 2024 election cycle. Volume exploded from $30 million in 2024 Q3 to $820 million in 2024 Q4. The new volume attracted sophisticated market makers, and with them, the extraction of value from taker flow.Pre-election, the average gap was -2.9 pp (takers winning); post-election, it flipped to +2.5 pp (makers winning), a swing of 5.3 percentage points.The composition of taker flow provides further evidence. If the wealth transfer arose because new participants arrived with stronger longshot preferences, we would expect the distribution to shift toward low-probability contracts. It did not:The share of taker volume in longshot contracts (1-20¢) remained essentially flat;  pre-election versus  post-election. The distribution actually shifted  the middle; the 91-99¢ bucket fell from 40-50% in 2021-2023 to under 20% in 2025, while mid-range prices (31-70¢) grew substantially. Taker behavior did not become more biased; if anything, it became less extreme. Yet taker losses increased; new market makers extract value more efficiently across all price levels.This evolution reframes the aggregate results. The wealth transfer from takers to makers is not inherent to prediction market microstructure; it requires sophisticated market makers, and sophisticated market makers require sufficient volume to justify participation. In the low-volume early period, makers were likely unsophisticated individuals who lost to relatively informed takers. The volume surge attracted professional liquidity providers capable of extracting value from taker flow at all price points.The maker-taker decomposition identifies  absorbs the losses, but leaves open the question of  their selection bias operates. Why is taker flow so consistently mispriced? The answer is not that makers possess superior foresight, but rather that takers exhibit a costly preference for affirmative outcomes.The Asymmetry at Equivalent PricesStandard efficiency models imply that mispricing should be symmetric across contract types at equivalent prices; a 1-cent YES contract and a 1-cent NO contract should theoretically reflect similar expected values. The data contradicts this assumption. At a price of 1 cent, a YES contract carries a historical expected value of -41%; buyers lose nearly half their capital in expectation. Conversely, a NO contract at the same 1-cent price delivers a historical expected value of +23%. The divergence between these seemingly identical probability estimates is 64 percentage points.The advantage for NO contracts is persistent. NO outperforms YES at , with the advantage concentrating at the market extremes. NO contracts generate superior returns at every price increment from  and again from .Despite the market being zero-sum, dollar-weighted returns are -1.02% for YES buyers compared to +0.83% for NO buyers, a 1.85 percentage point gap driven by the overpricing of YES contracts.Takers Prefer Affirmative BetsThe underperformance of YES contracts may be linked to taker behavior. Breaking down the trading data reveals a structural imbalance in order flow composition.In the 1-10 cent range, where YES represents the longshot outcome, takers account for 41-47% of YES volume; makers account for only 20-24%. This imbalance inverts at the opposite end of the probability curve. When contracts trade at 99 cents, implying that NO is the 1-cent longshot, makers actively purchase NO contracts at 43% of volume. Takers participate at a rate of only 23%.One might hypothesize that makers exploit this asymmetry through superior directional forecasting—that they simply know when to buy NO. The evidence does not support this. When decomposing maker performance by position direction, returns are nearly identical. Statistically significant differences emerge only at the extreme tails (1–10¢ and 91–99¢), and even there, effect sizes are negligible (Cohen's d = 0.02–0.03). This symmetry is telling: makers do not profit by knowing which way to bet, but through some mechanism that applies equally to both directions.The analysis of 72.1 million trades on Kalshi reveals a distinct market microstructure where wealth systematically transfers from liquidity takers to liquidity makers. This phenomenon is driven by specific behavioral biases, modulated by market maturity, and concentrated in categories that elicit high emotional engagement.A central question in zero-sum market analysis is whether profitable participants win through superior information (forecasting) or superior structure (market making). Our data strongly supports the latter. When decomposing maker returns by position direction, the performance gap is negligible: makers buying "YES" earn an excess return of +0.77%, while those buying "NO" earn +1.25% (Cohen’s d ≈ 0.02). This statistical symmetry indicates that makers do not possess a significant ability to pick winners. Instead, they profit via a structural arbitrage: providing liquidity to a taker population that exhibits a costly preference for affirmative, longshot outcomes.This extraction mechanism relies on the "Optimism Tax." Takers disproportionately purchase "YES" contracts at longshot prices, accounting for nearly half of all volume in that range, despite "YES" longshots underperforming "NO" longshots by up to 64 percentage points. Makers, therefore, do not need to predict the future; they simply need to act as the counterparty to optimism. This aligns with findings by Reichenbach and Walther (2025) on Polymarket and Whelan (2025) on Betfair, suggesting that in prediction markets, makers accommodate biased flow rather than out-forecast it.The Professionalization of LiquidityThe temporal evolution of maker-taker returns challenges the assumption that longshot bias inevitably leads to wealth transfer. From 2021 through 2023, the bias existed, yet takers maintained positive excess returns. The reversal of this trend coincides precisely with the explosive volume growth following Kalshi’s October 2024 legal victory.The wealth transfer observed in late 2024 is a function of . In the platform's infancy, low liquidity likely deterred sophisticated algorithmic market makers, leaving the order book to be populated by amateurs who were statistically indistinguishable from takers. The massive volume surge following the 2024 election incentivized the entry of professional liquidity providers capable of systematically capturing the spread and exploiting the biased flow. The longshot bias itself may have persisted for years, but it was only once market depth grew sufficiently to attract these sophisticated makers that the bias became a reliable source of profit extraction.Category Differences and Participant SelectionThe variation in maker-taker gaps across categories reveals how participant selection shapes market efficiency. At one extreme, Finance exhibits a gap of just 0.17 percentage points; nearly perfect efficiency. At the other, World Events and Media exceed 7 percentage points. This difference cannot be explained by the longshot bias alone; it reflects who chooses to trade in each category. serves as a control group demonstrating that prediction markets can approach efficiency. Questions like "Will the S&P close above 6000?" attract participants who think in probabilities and expected values, likely the same population that trades options or follows macroeconomic data. The barrier to informed participation is high, and casual bettors have no edge and likely recognize this, filtering themselves out. shows moderate inefficiency despite high emotional stakes. Political bettors follow polling closely and have practiced calibrating beliefs through election cycles. The gap is larger than Finance but far smaller than entertainment categories, suggesting that political engagement, while emotional, does not entirely erode probabilistic reasoning. represents the modal prediction market participant. The gap is moderate but consequential given the category's 72% volume share. Sports bettors exhibit well-documented biases, including home team loyalty, recency effects, and narrative attachment to star players. A fan betting on their team to win the championship is not calculating expected value; they are purchasing hope. attracts participants conditioned by the "number go up" mentality of retail crypto markets, a population overlapping with meme stock traders and NFT speculators. Questions like "Will Bitcoin reach $100k?" invite narrative-driven betting rather than probability estimation.Entertainment, Media, and World Events (4.79–7.32 pp) exhibit the largest gaps and share a common feature: minimal barriers to perceived expertise. Anyone who follows celebrity gossip feels qualified to bet on award show outcomes; anyone who reads headlines feels informed about geopolitics. This creates a participant pool that conflates familiarity with calibration.The pattern suggests efficiency depends on two factors: the technical barrier to informed participation and the degree to which questions invite emotional reasoning. When barriers are high and framing is clinical, markets approach efficiency; when barriers are low and framing invites storytelling, the optimism tax reaches its maximum.While the data is robust, several limitations persist. First, the absence of unique trader IDs forces us to rely on the "Maker/Taker" classification as a proxy for "Sophisticated/Unsophisticated." While standard in microstructure literature, this imperfectly captures instances where sophisticated traders cross the spread to act on time-sensitive information. Second, we cannot directly observe the bid-ask spread in historical trade data, making it difficult to strictly decouple spread capture from explotation of biased flow. Finally, these results are specific to a US-regulated environment; offshore venues with different leverage caps and fee structures may exhibit different dynamics.The promise of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse information into a single, accurate probability. However, our analysis of Kalshi demonstrates that this signal is often distorted by systematic wealth transfer driven by human psychology and market microstructure.The market is split into two distinct populations: a taker class that systematically overpays for low-probability, affirmative outcomes, and a maker class that extracts this premium through passive liquidity provision. This dynamic is not an inherent flaw of the "wisdom of the crowd," but rather a feature of how human psychology interacts with market microstructure. When the topic is dry and quantitative (Finance), the market is efficient. When the topic allows for tribalism and hope (Sports, Entertainment), the market transforms into a mechanism for transferring wealth from the optimistic to the calculated.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis</title><link>https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/</link><author>47282847</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:43:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lück, S., Callaghan, M., Borchers, M., Cowie, A., Fuss, S., Gidden, M., Hartmann, J., Kammann, C., Keller, D.P., Kraxner, F., Lamb, W.F., Mac Dowell, N., Müller-Hansen, F., Nemet, G.F., Probst, B.S., Renforth, P., Repke, T., Rickels, W., Schulte, I., Smith, P., Smith, S.M., Thrän, D., Troxler, T.G., Sick, V., Minx, J.C.

Why? Because these are components that (unless you’re doing something mighty fancy) should never require JavaScript as a dependency.But, in the world of web components you are locked into JavaScript from the very start. To even register a web component with the browser you need JavaScript.But what if… we didn’t do that?I’ve spent a good chunk of the last year focused on marketing site design systems at work. A regular topic of discussion is the need to build marketing sites that are accessible to folks with lower powered devices and poor internet connections. How do you achieve that? In short, use less JavaScript and ideally build UI with progressive enhancement in mind.There are many ways to achieve these goals, but the method I’ve been focused on is how an HTML Web Component archictecture might be applied to implement a marketing site design system.As a quick reminder/intro, HTML Web Components is a method of building web components where you write HTML as you would normally and then wrap the parts you want to be interactive using a custom element.For example, if you wanted to create a counter button it would look like this:The markup in an HTML web component is parsed, rendered, and styled as normal HTML. That HTML will then be seamlessly hydrated once the JavaScript associated with the custom element tag is executed.
	In contrast, the markup of a "regular" web component (that uses Shadow DOM) is dynamically generated at runtime using JavaScript -- kind of like an SPA.
This component architecture is a really strong candidate for a marketing design system (and, as a bonus, avoids some of the big gotchas that come with regular web components).It is a perfect implementation of progressively enhanced UIIt uses minimal and self-contained JavaScript — HTML Web Components can be thought of as islandsYou still get the power of custom element APIs to implement stuff like design system component variantsThe component markup is fully SSR-ableThe component markup can be styled like regular HTMLCommon accessibility practices can be applied without issueBut for all these benefits we’re still left with the original problem. HTML Web Components require JavaScript.So here’s the question: What would happen if we took the ideas of HTML Web Components and skipped all the JavaScript?You get CSS Web Components.Note: I've never seen anyone talk about or name this concept before, so I'm using "CSS Web Components" to describe the idea. But please let me know if someone has already written about and named this!How do they work? The exact same as HTML Web Components but you just take advantage of the powers of CSS to implement key functionality.As an example let’s implement that swimlane component:Okay great, we styled some HTML nested inside a custom element. There’s nothing too novel about that. But what about adding some functionality? Say, a component variant that lets you reverse the layout of the swimlane?It’s possible using only CSS! Specifically, CSS attribute selectors.Another really cool perk of this is that because you’re defining an attribute on a custom element you don’t have to worry about naming collisions with HTML attributes. No need to add  to the beginning of attributes like you would/should on normal HTML elements.In theory, I believe this method of building design systems can go quite far. If you think about it, the vast majority of basic components you might need in a marketing design system are just vanilla HTML elements with specific style variations.A marketing website button is just an anchor tag wrapped in a  custom element and styled using custom attribute selectors.From here, imagine incorporating all the other powers that CSS (and HTML) bring to the table:The possibilities are quite large.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;Anyone else out there vibe circuit-building?&quot;</title><link>https://twitter.com/beneater/status/2012988790709928305</link><author>thetrustworthy</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:14:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GLM-4.7-Flash</title><link>https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash</link><author>scrlk</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:12:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GLM-4.7-Flash is a 30B-A3B MoE model.
